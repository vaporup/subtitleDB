1
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,909
Is this the Roxy Nightclub?

2
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:28,543
It was, they pulled it down years ago

3
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:11,462
Him, in the white shirt

4
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:22,198
Bastard! I'll teach you
to grope girls on the subway!

5
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:45,726
Jerk! I was groped!
Why didn't you come when I called?

6
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:48,299
Stop it, you're as bad as him!

7
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:34,578
What's your name?

8
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,066
Brother Chai!

9
00:08:12,351 --> 00:08:14,046
I'm on your case, you little fart!

10
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,221
Been busy?

11
00:08:19,692 --> 00:08:21,990
Forgotten the sound of my voice?

12
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:28,127
Brother Chai... give me a break

13
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:32,629
I promise I'll pay,
but right now I'm broke

14
00:08:33,372 --> 00:08:35,704
I'm freelance, I'm doing my best

15
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:38,103
Sure you are! Tell you what...

16
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:41,742
You can have a discount
if you pay me now, okay?

17
00:08:42,014 --> 00:08:42,946
Brother Chai, I...

18
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:45,481
I really am broke! How can I pay you?

19
00:08:45,618 --> 00:08:50,317
I'll pay you back in six installments,
I promise!

20
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:53,220
One payment a month, okay?

21
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:56,317
Is that a joke?
You said the same last time!

22
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,890
And what about the other debts
you said you'd cover?

23
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:03,364
Your mother, Dee Dee,
Candy, May and Cat's?

24
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,699
If you're broke,
we'll have to take one hand instead

25
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:09,840
Brother, you're real tough!
Which gang are you with?

26
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:11,034
Who the hell are you?

27
00:09:11,811 --> 00:09:15,110
You want to hear my triad password?

28
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:16,474
Get him!

29
00:09:16,616 --> 00:09:18,641
What? You think I'm beneath you?

30
00:09:19,719 --> 00:09:21,846
Calm down, calm down

31
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,748
We can talk it over, no hassle

32
00:09:25,157 --> 00:09:27,887
I was just teasing him,
what's your name?

33
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:32,492
That's my business, you scumbag!

34
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,535
See if your boss knows Mountain Leopard

35
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:40,136
You know? As in the mountain cat?

36
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:49,206
Fine, I'll remember you...

37
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:51,582
Move!

38
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,087
Kiddo!

39
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,818
You'll pay for this!

40
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,966
Now I'm in deep shit

41
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:11,932
Uncle... where are you from?

42
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,535
When I...

43
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:16,606
Never mind, why are you following me?

44
00:10:19,845 --> 00:10:21,676
You want to report me
for what happened in the bookstore?

45
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:27,043
I need help to kill someone... Interested?

46
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:31,046
Uncle, stop kidding

47
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,055
Aren't you getting on
a bit to be a hitman?

48
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,230
Who do you want killed?

49
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,932
I'll tell you later

50
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:47,695
You know somewhere I can lie low?

51
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:51,374
Hey, what's your name?

52
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:53,671
They call me Smokey

53
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:58,316
I'll carry your things

54
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:00,609
Thanks

55
00:11:02,722 --> 00:11:03,586
Uncle Wah...

56
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:06,556
I know, mixed,
extra sesame oil and one to go

57
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:10,858
- Has your ma remembered yet?
- No.

58
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:15,598
Try it

59
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:19,327
Haven't had these for ages

60
00:11:21,574 --> 00:11:23,872
Have you been abroad?
The way you talk is... odd

61
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,436
Odd?

62
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,340
Old-fashioned!

63
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,306
It'll come back!

64
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,748
Sure

65
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,220
Yes, I'm just back...
Been in Brazil for 30 years

66
00:11:37,523 --> 00:11:41,983
Brazil? Where the girls dance
in feathers all day?

67
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:43,254
Famous for soccer too

68
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,127
Did you have a girlfriend?

69
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:47,427
Scored some goals too

70
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:50,065
By the way, what do you do?

71
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:53,768
Checking up on me?

72
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:57,667
Just asking, you don't have to say

73
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:02,274
I sell pirated CDs, have the odd fight...

74
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:06,915
Play a bit of snooker and find johns
for my friends at night! Get it?

75
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:10,652
Sure, I used to be much the same

76
00:12:12,258 --> 00:12:13,555
What's your name?

77
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,792
I just told you!

78
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,529
I mean your real name

79
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,703
Marlboro

80
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:31,603
That rings a bell...

81
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,247
Stay here, I have to deliver something

82
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,602
Mister, come on in!

83
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:02,604
- Nice, legal-age girls!
- No.

84
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:08,108
Upstairs you can have fun... a drink,
a smoke, a dance...

85
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:10,714
- No...
- Come on...

86
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:37,935
Dee Dee!

87
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:40,041
Hey, I was only joking!

88
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,338
Two can play at that game

89
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:47,075
Cool it, I won't do it again!

90
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,283
Really?

91
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,253
You know why I've stuck with you
all this time?

92
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,220
Because you didn't treat me
like a hooker!

93
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:54,825
I know, I really didn't mean it

94
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:56,359
I was joking, I won't do it again

95
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,429
Go joke with your mother!

96
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:03,700
Don't bring my mother into it...

97
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,237
Why is she so pissed off?

98
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:08,667
I made fun of her

99
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,271
She's a hooker?

100
00:14:11,911 --> 00:14:14,607
Make fun of a hooker
and you deserve what you get

101
00:14:15,047 --> 00:14:16,344
What's with your hair?

102
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,146
You live alone? What's all this stuff?

103
00:14:19,385 --> 00:14:22,218
My ma lives here too,
but she isn't here much

104
00:14:22,621 --> 00:14:25,715
We rent storage space
to the stallholders downstairs

105
00:14:27,626 --> 00:14:28,991
So when does it happen?

106
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,227
What?

107
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,658
Don't you want to kill someone?

108
00:14:35,434 --> 00:14:38,369
The police are right opposite!
Keep your voice down!

109
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:43,198
Hide in plain sight!
Are you really a killer?

110
00:14:44,076 --> 00:14:45,168
What are you shooting?

111
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:49,338
Nothing, I'm watching
for jay-walking cops

112
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,607
If I catch one, I'll sell it to TV

113
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,249
Who made the bed?

114
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:55,417
Who are you after?

115
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:58,821
- Nine Dragons.
- Nine Dragons?

116
00:14:58,991 --> 00:15:00,253
We should go shopping today

117
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:03,223
For what? I know where to buy a gun

118
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:05,320
Clothes! Come on

119
00:15:06,966 --> 00:15:08,194
You're going out like that?

120
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,033
Just checking for danger first

121
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,773
So who's this Nine Dragons?

122
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,580
He was notorious
in Yaumatei 30 years ago

123
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:31,819
We were bitter rivals, evenly matched

124
00:15:32,624 --> 00:15:35,218
30 years ago?
How do you expect me to find him?

125
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:36,919
He might be dead by now!

126
00:15:37,196 --> 00:15:39,130
Maybe your 'brothers' can help

127
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,361
Ask them where he is and what he's doing

128
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:47,895
But don't let on that Mountain Leopard
is back in Hong Kong!

129
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,037
If he's not dead,
he'll be around your age

130
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,404
You think he'll come for you?

131
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,105
What's your beef with this guy anyway?

132
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:00,509
He stole my woman

133
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:03,579
Two oldsters fighting over a girl?

134
00:16:04,123 --> 00:16:05,590
That's why you want him shot?

135
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:08,818
He also betrayed his boss
and cheated his 'brothers'

136
00:16:08,994 --> 00:16:11,189
He stole money,
stole his boss's woman... you want more?

137
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,663
I get it

138
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:21,072
I can see you're a righteous guy

139
00:16:22,374 --> 00:16:25,002
How long have you been at this game?
Who's your boss?

140
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:31,850
You could say I was born into it

141
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:36,452
Oh, I took you for somebody with rank!

142
00:16:36,688 --> 00:16:40,590
I thought you were in this big time

143
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,129
You seemed so brave last night

144
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,394
No big deal

145
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:52,001
Hookers are people too

146
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:56,830
Right, hookers are people too

147
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:58,702
Come on

148
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,374
Let me see!

149
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:22,825
Ma, I'll be making big money soon

150
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:24,665
We can move somewhere better

151
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,301
Hold it!

152
00:17:33,812 --> 00:17:35,541
Never mind, you can go

153
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:37,743
Crazy!

154
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,409
Huh, you couldn't be my father
with a face like that!

155
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,487
Let's move, okay?

156
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,124
Where to?

157
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:59,660
That the hell are you doing?
Taking a dump?

158
00:19:00,032 --> 00:19:01,465
Come on, can we go?

159
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:05,862
Hi, Smokey

160
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:07,563
On the job early today?

161
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,240
- Yes.
- Okay, let's go.

162
00:19:11,777 --> 00:19:14,268
Don't I look younger now?

163
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:17,681
Why are you dressed like that?

164
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:19,180
Uncle, we're only looking for leads

165
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:21,746
What if I run into my old girlfriend?

166
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:24,947
Come on, Smokey

167
00:20:29,554 --> 00:20:33,115
Mister, full service is only $800

168
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:34,589
Who's first?

169
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,891
We're looking for Nine Dragons

170
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,328
It was really something!

171
00:20:43,835 --> 00:20:46,133
Four of them,
waving choppers, cornered me

172
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:50,965
Believe me, those were big choppers!

173
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,201
But I wasn't scared

174
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:58,111
I could see
one of the bastards was trembling...

175
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:02,219
Those guys are
old enough to be my father

176
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:05,549
They dye their hair, but they're past it

177
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,882
All they can do is brag

178
00:21:08,026 --> 00:21:09,926
That guy was bleeding from a head-wound

179
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:13,427
Didn't know where he was!

180
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:16,893
Be he still came for me with his chopper

181
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:22,906
So I leapt in the air...

182
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:27,305
...and gave him a side-kick

183
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,977
Believe me,
I may have kicked him too hard...

184
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,246
The bastard flew in the air...

185
00:21:35,387 --> 00:21:39,756
...right over a truck,
and hit the ground out cold!

186
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:43,854
There were four of them, you said.
What about the other three?

187
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:45,086
They stood around watching?

188
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,891
I need a pee, I'll tell you afterwards

189
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,692
Come on, you can't take a pee now

190
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:52,393
Those kids are just street-punks

191
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:55,630
Small-time, but full of themselves

192
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:58,139
Boss...

193
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,805
What is El Nino?

194
00:22:02,013 --> 00:22:04,880
You jerk, you don't even know that?

195
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:09,417
El Nino is... a big really deal!

196
00:22:09,554 --> 00:22:11,886
It pours with rain, there are hurricanes

197
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,115
Floods, earthquakes...

198
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,626
When El Nino shows up, everyone runs!

199
00:22:17,829 --> 00:22:19,558
You're so dumb, you really are

200
00:22:19,698 --> 00:22:23,293
Boss, you're just like El Nino!

201
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:25,164
Sure I am

202
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,895
Stop talking and eat!

203
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,974
That bastard son-of-a-bitch!

204
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,701
Dares make trouble in my place?

205
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,080
- Haven't you heard?
- Yes...

206
00:22:36,548 --> 00:22:39,415
That's Third Sister,
she runs these three districts

207
00:22:39,618 --> 00:22:41,085
Doesn't he know we run this joint?

208
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:42,345
Idiot!

209
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:45,682
Didn't you tell all the bosses
we turned the sauna into a bookstore?

210
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,288
Yes, exactly as you said

211
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,325
And each gang got 100 discount vouchers

212
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:52,462
Either that guy meant
to stir up trouble...

213
00:22:52,597 --> 00:22:54,758
...or he's an ignorant jerk

214
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,458
Whichever it is...

215
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,602
...find him for me

216
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:00,032
Yes, Third Sister

217
00:23:02,107 --> 00:23:05,099
This is a good book,
order 100 copies for me

218
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,368
Yes, ma'am

219
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:10,614
Can we get the writer in to sign copies?

220
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:12,580
She's dead

221
00:23:14,753 --> 00:23:17,313
Who'd have thought
she would die so young

222
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:20,657
She was 90

223
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:24,759
Bing Xin

224
00:23:24,963 --> 00:23:26,294
Right, Bing Xin

225
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:28,223
- Bing Xin...
- Yes, Bing Xin.

226
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,993
Bing Xin wrote it?

227
00:23:30,969 --> 00:23:32,664
No mistake, Bing Xin

228
00:23:32,804 --> 00:23:34,772
Right

229
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,318
We're looked everywhere

230
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:50,646
Want to try someplace else?

231
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,118
Over there...

232
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:58,520
I want to go back

233
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,188
- It's early...
- I want to go back.

234
00:24:20,318 --> 00:24:21,478
Aren't you feeling well?

235
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:23,914
It's not even dark yet
and you want to go back!

236
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:25,613
But you're up at 3
to practice your kung-fu

237
00:24:25,824 --> 00:24:28,349
Is that how killers live in Brazil?

238
00:24:29,127 --> 00:24:31,755
Do all kids in Hong Kong
ask so many questions?

239
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,454
Let's get this straight:
You're not my boss

240
00:24:33,965 --> 00:24:36,433
I thought you were a killer,
so I agreed to help you

241
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:38,000
I want to make a name for myself

242
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,127
I won't stay a nobody all my life!

243
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:43,972
But I don't know...
you don't seem like a killer at all

244
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,043
This is a critical time
of day for killers

245
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:54,378
Can't see clearly in this light

246
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,011
So what?

247
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:57,781
You might kill the wrong guy!

248
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:01,049
Most killers go home around this time

249
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:02,556
Kill which wrong guy?

250
00:25:03,028 --> 00:25:04,620
You haven't found the right guy yet!

251
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,360
Why carry the gun if you're so worried?

252
00:25:07,499 --> 00:25:10,491
There's only one bullet in it anyway

253
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:11,860
You've been looking through my things?

254
00:25:12,404 --> 00:25:14,167
Give me a break, killer!

255
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:16,201
A real hitman nowadays uses...

256
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:19,777
...a Gow 26, a Mark 25 or even a USP

257
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,512
Show some respect, I have many guns!

258
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:27,150
In Brazil, even beggars have guns!

259
00:25:28,787 --> 00:25:32,484
A hitman relies on a bullet, not a gun

260
00:25:33,124 --> 00:25:34,523
And on his own resolve!

261
00:25:35,427 --> 00:25:38,453
How many people have you killed?

262
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,236
In a year? Or in a month?

263
00:25:48,974 --> 00:25:50,339
Where's my toupee?

264
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:54,110
Have you hidden it?
I've told you not to touch my things!

265
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:01,208
I'm going to buy some cigs

266
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:05,979
I was just talking

267
00:26:06,691 --> 00:26:08,522
You don't have to take it so hard!

268
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,754
But you have plenty of hair,
why take my toupee?

269
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,434
Why did you take my toupee?

270
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:00,473
Sister Ha,
ask your girls to help find someone

271
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,738
It's a man in his fifties...

272
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,676
...with nine dragon tattoos

273
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,713
- Nine dragons?
- Right.

274
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,783
No-one I've seen... try asking them

275
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:10,316
No, don't know him

276
00:27:11,022 --> 00:27:14,185
Sometimes they come
before they're undressed

277
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,764
"If I hadn't met you,
where would I be now?"

278
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:35,808
"Would my days be empty,
my life be dull?"

279
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:42,542
"If I hadn't met you,
where would I be now?"

280
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:49,323
"If I hadn't met you,
where would I be now?"

281
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:52,223
Who's he?

282
00:27:52,997 --> 00:27:55,431
Must be a Teresa Teng fan

283
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,767
Uncle, you've sung that song
so many times

284
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:03,567
Play some games, okay?

285
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:06,503
Garfield... Paper!

286
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,134
Garfield...

287
00:28:09,047 --> 00:28:10,036
You lose! Drink!

288
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:12,649
- Garfield... Paper!
- Garfield... Bite!

289
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:14,312
- Drink!
- Drink!

290
00:28:14,452 --> 00:28:15,510
Garfield... Paper!

291
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,245
Garfield... Bite!

292
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,348
Drink! Your turn!

293
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:23,016
You lose, drink up!

294
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:24,128
- Drink!
- You lost, drink!

295
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:26,797
- You lost, drink!
- Drink!

296
00:28:27,132 --> 00:28:28,565
I only win this

297
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,128
Look who's here!

298
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:32,594
What do you want?

299
00:28:32,937 --> 00:28:34,097
Nothing

300
00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:38,505
Last time you pointed a gun at me,
I should return the compliment

301
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,570
Let's sit down and talk

302
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:47,842
We can settle this like 'brothers'

303
00:28:49,087 --> 00:28:51,078
If my friend has offended you...

304
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:54,218
...he can compensate you
and throw a banquet for you

305
00:28:55,293 --> 00:28:56,089
Everybody shakes hands and forgets it

306
00:28:56,227 --> 00:28:57,626
Crap!

307
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,795
I've just got back from LA

308
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:09,871
I just came back from Brazil!

309
00:29:16,581 --> 00:29:18,344
You have balls

310
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:20,343
You really do

311
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:22,152
You're Mountain Leopard?

312
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,814
Get down and show me how you leap

313
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:27,515
On the ground... show me!

314
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:34,623
What's a that? A cat could do better!

315
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:38,132
Go!

316
00:29:41,673 --> 00:29:44,164
- Go!
- After them!

317
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:52,008
That way.

318
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:36,658
These bastards don't know
the underworld code!

319
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:40,029
They attack me without knowing who I am!

320
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:42,098
What do bosses teach
their kids these days?

321
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:47,694
Before, we always spelled out
our backgrounds before fighting

322
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:52,604
He was right, you looked like a cat

323
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:55,804
Those girls made me
play that Garfield game

324
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,346
So I had Garfield on the brain

325
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:02,351
I could've beaten them
if I hadn't been drinking

326
00:31:03,087 --> 00:31:05,954
Okay, thanks

327
00:31:10,895 --> 00:31:12,294
Happy birthday!

328
00:31:13,698 --> 00:31:17,566
Er... yes, sure I got you a present

329
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,832
It's a very big

330
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:23,801
It's on its way now

331
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:25,336
Bye

332
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:32,549
Is it too much to give someone
a piano as a birthday present?

333
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:36,950
Well, it's too late to buy a tank! Push!

334
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:01,603
It's starting to rain! Hurry!

335
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:06,815
- Let's shelter.
- Sure.

336
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,557
I'm drenched.

337
00:32:17,028 --> 00:32:18,256
What's up?

338
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,724
It won't stop raining for some time

339
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,902
Dry my back for me, please

340
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:37,144
You'll catch cold

341
00:32:38,483 --> 00:32:39,882
That's a really big leopard

342
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,881
This is a really big present

343
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,287
Thank you

344
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,092
Let's have a smoke

345
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:02,766
You're in love with that Dee Dee?

346
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:09,469
No, we just grew up together

347
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:13,275
Our mothers were both hookers

348
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:18,285
But her ma died of
breast cancer last year

349
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:20,823
That's why she hangs out with me

350
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,588
Her ma was once the most famous hooker
in Temple Street

351
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:30,759
Do you remember her?
They called her 'Big Tits'

352
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:33,059
Rings a bell

353
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:35,566
And your mother?

354
00:33:39,944 --> 00:33:41,502
My ma...

355
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,344
She's still in Temple Street every day,
looking for my dad

356
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,482
Your dad is missing?

357
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,155
One day, my dad
went to Temple Street to get laid

358
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:00,556
He was through
before Ma finished one cigarette

359
00:34:01,566 --> 00:34:03,591
But she still got pregnant

360
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,301
So that's why they call you 'Smokey'!

361
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,508
She was smoking,
so she didn't see dad's face that well

362
00:34:13,044 --> 00:34:17,743
So she goes there every day,
hoping to spot him passing by

363
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:22,081
So far, he's never shown up

364
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,161
What's that half-cigarette?

365
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,899
My girlfriend gave it to me

366
00:34:43,508 --> 00:34:44,998
I've kept it so long

367
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:49,678
Who was this unforgettable woman?

368
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:53,980
She's very pretty

369
00:34:55,987 --> 00:34:58,820
I've seen many women in Brazil...

370
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:04,285
...but hers is the only face
which stays with me

371
00:35:07,999 --> 00:35:10,092
Impossible!

372
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,032
You don't believe me?

373
00:35:21,812 --> 00:35:25,304
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen

374
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,157
Mind you, at that time...

375
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:39,686
...I wasn't bad myself

376
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:14,189
"Temple Street"

377
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:58,077
You can't have two tigers
on one mountain

378
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:01,522
We were bound to clash eventually

379
00:40:02,293 --> 00:40:04,488
Neither of us wanted to lose face

380
00:40:05,796 --> 00:40:08,788
It finally happened
one evening in the Roxy Nightclub

381
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:03,005
Is she staring at you or me?

382
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,447
Me

383
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:07,676
No, it's me

384
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:10,480
It's definitely me

385
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,494
What makes you so sure?

386
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,102
Her eyes, I can tell

387
00:42:27,705 --> 00:42:31,732
It's her eyes that tell me it's me!

388
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:33,273
It's different

389
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:34,770
Why?

390
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:42,752
Because I'm also staring straight at her

391
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,316
And you're not

392
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,015
Go ask her if you want

393
00:42:49,393 --> 00:42:50,917
No need

394
00:42:51,095 --> 00:42:55,054
There'd be no doubt about it...

395
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:58,463
...if only one of us was here

396
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:50,114
Finally, Nine Dragons lost

397
00:43:51,855 --> 00:43:55,450
I went up to her and asked...

398
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,797
Were you looking at me or him?

399
00:44:03,634 --> 00:44:08,196
I looked at you
while I smoked this cigarette

400
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:15,477
But it's about to burn out

401
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,945
I won't let it

402
00:44:34,098 --> 00:44:36,089
But Nine Dragons didn't accept defeat

403
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,958
He shot me in the back!

404
00:44:40,971 --> 00:44:45,067
While I was out cold,
he dumped me on a ship

405
00:44:47,578 --> 00:44:49,671
And I woke up in Brazil

406
00:44:50,748 --> 00:44:52,807
I've been there for 30 years!

407
00:44:55,385 --> 00:44:58,912
So Nine Dragons stole your woman?
I gotta find him

408
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:02,321
Gotta chop off his ears and fingers,
then finish him off

409
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:42,690
But she wasn't really your woman, though

410
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,992
How so?

411
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:47,962
You just saw her briefly,
you don't even know her name!

412
00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:51,506
You didn't kiss her!
How can she be your woman?

413
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:52,868
Don't say that!

414
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,911
When you look at a woman,
and her eyes say "yes"

415
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:57,707
Then she is

416
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:01,613
You call that love? No way!

417
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,317
If so, I have lots of women!

418
00:46:07,591 --> 00:46:11,288
If you woke tomorrow
remembering only one thing...

419
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:13,923
...would it be a woman's face?

420
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:16,630
Which woman?

421
00:46:19,102 --> 00:46:21,093
All I remember is her face

422
00:46:22,072 --> 00:46:23,596
Good, at least you know
what she looks like!

423
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:27,372
But even if Nine Dragons
gives her back to you...

424
00:46:27,544 --> 00:46:28,602
...she must be quite old by now

425
00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:30,269
Will you still recognise her?

426
00:46:34,051 --> 00:46:38,681
I know, what I most want
to remember is my dad's face

427
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:43,255
Ma can't remember it at all

428
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,787
My place is over there!

429
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:16,420
Just checking that those punks have gone

430
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:18,759
This way?

431
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:20,124
This way

432
00:47:43,854 --> 00:47:45,253
Where's the salt?

433
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:49,886
On the shelf, salt on the left,
sugar on the right

434
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:53,624
Did you catch a cop jaywalking?

435
00:47:54,097 --> 00:47:58,124
No, just you putting sugar in the stew

436
00:47:59,136 --> 00:48:01,696
Never mind, tastes better with sugar

437
00:48:03,373 --> 00:48:06,604
You can cook! And there's steaks...

438
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:10,803
I was a cook for years in Brazil.
Stop that!

439
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,278
You were just a cook?

440
00:48:15,385 --> 00:48:17,580
It was a cover for my real identity

441
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:25,184
For 30 years? Wasn't it boring?
No girlfriends?

442
00:48:25,395 --> 00:48:27,260
Girlfriends? No...

443
00:48:27,965 --> 00:48:29,125
Why not?

444
00:48:29,733 --> 00:48:33,294
Didn't have time

445
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,800
Other things on my mind

446
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:40,874
And when I felt like having a girl,
I couldn't find one

447
00:48:41,745 --> 00:48:44,213
Too busy... no time

448
00:48:44,414 --> 00:48:46,905
Didn't give it much thought

449
00:48:47,117 --> 00:48:52,646
As time went by, I forgot all about it

450
00:48:56,026 --> 00:48:59,553
I did have one good friend,
called Ronaldo

451
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:01,161
Ronaldo?

452
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:03,131
The soccer player?

453
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:05,658
He was my neighbour,
I was close to his dad

454
00:49:05,802 --> 00:49:08,202
We hung out together

455
00:49:08,505 --> 00:49:11,440
Is this more of your boasting? Hang on...

456
00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:13,065
I'll record this, say it again

457
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:15,041
What's strange about it?

458
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:18,177
He lived next door to my restaurant

459
00:49:18,348 --> 00:49:21,408
He kicked a ball around with me
after school, that's all

460
00:49:21,618 --> 00:49:24,451
He has an amazing name...

461
00:49:24,588 --> 00:49:27,580
Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima

462
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:31,524
It's as long as Pele's real name:
24 letters!

463
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:32,854
That's enough, stop it!

464
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:34,289
I need this footage...

465
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:36,922
...for next time
you say never exaggerate

466
00:49:37,134 --> 00:49:38,533
You think I'm sick?

467
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:40,097
Looks like it

468
00:49:46,043 --> 00:49:49,103
Look, Ma, recognise this guy?

469
00:49:49,246 --> 00:49:50,804
Look carefully

470
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:52,881
Why are you with this short guy again?

471
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:57,348
Look up there

472
00:49:57,487 --> 00:49:59,284
Did you come to this brothel
18 years ago?

473
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:03,650
I was in Brazil 18 years ago

474
00:50:05,862 --> 00:50:08,456
Weren't you that butcher from Yaumatei?

475
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:15,829
Believe me...

476
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:19,400
I was tops in the Thirteen Gang

477
00:50:19,676 --> 00:50:22,702
Chi Hung will confirm it

478
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:28,083
One time, all of us went to a brothel
in Temple Street

479
00:50:28,852 --> 00:50:32,788
And we wanted to eat afterwards

480
00:50:33,256 --> 00:50:35,417
When we got to Parker's Street...

481
00:50:36,226 --> 00:50:42,028
...where the Washington Theatre
used to be...

482
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:45,362
It's a McDonald's now

483
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:51,167
...a hundred men showed up with choppers!

484
00:50:51,908 --> 00:50:55,844
They attacked us without warning!

485
00:50:57,347 --> 00:50:59,315
I was smart

486
00:50:59,716 --> 00:51:04,176
I ran...

487
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:06,456
...as fast as I could...

488
00:51:06,923 --> 00:51:10,051
...to Yaumatei Police Station

489
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,659
Reported to the police

490
00:51:13,563 --> 00:51:15,895
The police leapt into action

491
00:51:16,433 --> 00:51:18,799
And rescued my 'brothers'

492
00:51:18,969 --> 00:51:22,200
My action saved the whole gang

493
00:51:22,405 --> 00:51:26,739
Brother Kei,
who dared to attack you guys?

494
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:30,744
Jealous rival gangs, of course

495
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:35,180
Ever heard of a guy
known as Nine Dragons?

496
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:36,751
I remember Eight Dragons...

497
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,488
Eight Dragons? That's a joke!

498
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:42,885
You know Nine Dragons?

499
00:51:43,026 --> 00:51:44,687
Sure I do!

500
00:51:45,028 --> 00:51:48,486
We all knew him

501
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:51,724
He had nine dragons tattooed on his back

502
00:52:26,703 --> 00:52:27,931
Who are you want?

503
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:31,939
Smokey... I'm Dee Dee

504
00:52:32,275 --> 00:52:33,503
Dee Dee?

505
00:52:33,743 --> 00:52:36,337
Smokey's girlfriend...
I've seen you before

506
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,715
You may be Smokey's girlfriend,
but I don't think we've met

507
00:52:39,916 --> 00:52:42,111
Anyhow, he's out right now

508
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,015
I came to thank him for the piano

509
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,881
That's okay, I helped him steal it

510
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,268
Garfield... Paw!
Garfield... Bite! Garfield...

511
00:53:12,882 --> 00:53:15,373
Garfield... Bite!

512
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:21,490
Garfield... Paw! ...Bite!

513
00:53:50,887 --> 00:53:52,320
I've found Nine Dragons!

514
00:54:26,156 --> 00:54:27,623
Is one bullet enough?

515
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:16,903
He's a gang boss, well-protected

516
00:55:17,841 --> 00:55:21,038
Do I look better in a suit?

517
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,378
Brother Leopard...
how shall we tackle him?

518
00:55:27,183 --> 00:55:28,912
We have to make a plan

519
00:55:29,552 --> 00:55:31,383
First, check if they're all men

520
00:55:31,755 --> 00:55:34,087
Before anything else,
I have to find out where my woman is

521
00:55:35,024 --> 00:55:36,787
Then I...

522
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,854
Shall we go in together or separately?

523
00:55:41,731 --> 00:55:43,164
Are you scared?

524
00:55:44,134 --> 00:55:45,601
You can still back out

525
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,963
My bag is stuffed with US dollars

526
00:55:48,872 --> 00:55:50,362
You go back first

527
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:53,064
Brother Leopard...

528
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:11,820
So many people! Something's going on...

529
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,528
Looks like a rumble

530
00:57:29,906 --> 00:57:31,373
What's going on?

531
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:33,504
Dunno, the boss told us to come

532
00:57:34,244 --> 00:57:35,905
What's happening?

533
00:57:36,112 --> 00:57:37,773
Dunno, Blondie sent for me

534
00:57:37,914 --> 00:57:39,575
Boss, you wanted us here

535
00:57:41,284 --> 00:57:42,774
Oh... right...

536
00:57:43,052 --> 00:57:44,212
What's going on?

537
00:57:44,354 --> 00:57:45,753
The boss told me to come

538
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:48,383
- You?
- I came with them.

539
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,156
Damn it, what's going on?

540
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:57,164
- What's going on?
- What...?

541
00:57:57,367 --> 00:57:59,028
Shooting stars!

542
00:58:14,684 --> 00:58:16,345
There's another!

543
00:58:16,553 --> 00:58:18,783
And over there!

544
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,757
Don't let me get chopped tonight!

545
00:59:14,644 --> 00:59:15,736
Chop him!

546
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,680
Smokey, can you see Nine Dragons?

547
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,472
I think he's gone

548
00:59:52,649 --> 00:59:54,207
It's fate

549
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,519
Did you make a wish?

550
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:02,247
Yeah, did you?

551
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:04,486
Me too

552
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:07,790
What was yours?

553
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,923
You first

554
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:15,434
I just wished my ma
would remember dad's face

555
01:00:15,805 --> 01:00:17,568
Then she wouldn't need
to stand in the street all day

556
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:19,668
And you?

557
01:00:20,476 --> 01:00:21,875
I wished to...

558
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:24,442
...remember my woman's face
for the rest of my life

559
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:27,646
What's the point of that?

560
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,284
It's up to you!
Who can stop you remembering?

561
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,033
You're sure Nine Dragons comes here?

562
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:48,828
I was tipped off

563
01:00:49,038 --> 01:00:52,735
He watched those shooting stars
with the boss of this sauna

564
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,604
I think he's often here

565
01:00:55,411 --> 01:00:57,208
Can you trust that tip?

566
01:00:58,448 --> 01:01:00,177
We'll soon know

567
01:01:19,202 --> 01:01:22,228
I dreamt of my dad last night

568
01:01:23,005 --> 01:01:25,701
So your wish worked, huh?

569
01:01:26,509 --> 01:01:27,737
What's he like?

570
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:31,079
Not too tall, but well-built

571
01:01:31,214 --> 01:01:32,579
Looks impressive

572
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:37,412
you can see right away
that he's righteous

573
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:41,212
I saw him finishing off some bad guys...
a real hero

574
01:01:41,924 --> 01:01:44,324
That tough?

575
01:01:44,494 --> 01:01:45,859
What does he look like?

576
01:01:48,297 --> 01:01:49,628
Dunno

577
01:01:50,299 --> 01:01:52,062
- No face?
- No face

578
01:01:52,568 --> 01:01:55,594
Not too tall, but strong and righteous

579
01:01:55,738 --> 01:01:57,365
And faceless

580
01:01:57,507 --> 01:02:00,101
And he guns down baddies

581
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:04,569
Sound more like a fantasy
than a hero to me!

582
01:02:04,981 --> 01:02:07,279
No, in my dream
he was just a regular guy

583
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:08,815
Regular, but no face.
I'm not boasting about him...

584
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:11,111
That's just how he was

585
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:14,154
Did he look like him?

586
01:02:15,391 --> 01:02:17,154
- No.
- The other one.

587
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:18,452
This guy coming up now?

588
01:02:18,628 --> 01:02:19,993
No!

589
01:02:20,129 --> 01:02:21,187
That guy, then?

590
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:22,991
Are you kidding?

591
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,401
Have a smoke,
and keep watching for Nine Dragons

592
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:41,740
It's dark, let's call it a day

593
01:02:42,118 --> 01:02:44,279
It's not even dusk yet!

594
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,411
Not the sky, it's smoke

595
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:49,553
You can check

596
01:02:49,725 --> 01:02:51,590
Come to see

597
01:02:51,861 --> 01:02:54,955
Let's go home

598
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:11,007
You dared to chop someone in our shop,
you little bastard?

599
01:03:11,247 --> 01:03:13,010
And still act cocky?

600
01:03:15,251 --> 01:03:17,378
I really didn't know
it was Third Sister's place

601
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,885
You didn't?

602
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,353
Ears wide shut, huh?
How dare you make trouble here?

603
01:03:22,558 --> 01:03:26,858
Drag the police in and they'll think
we're running a brothel here

604
01:03:27,296 --> 01:03:28,558
How could we survive then?

605
01:03:28,698 --> 01:03:31,565
Enough of this, which hand
did you use to chop that guy?

606
01:03:31,901 --> 01:03:34,631
- Get me a chopper!
- No! Don't!

607
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,469
You're a bold one

608
01:03:40,042 --> 01:03:43,978
Some guy groped a hooker
and you chopped off his hand

609
01:03:44,180 --> 01:03:46,080
She was only a hooker

610
01:03:46,649 --> 01:03:49,049
I'm sorry I messed up your place,
Third Sister! Really!

611
01:03:49,185 --> 01:03:50,447
Please let me off!

612
01:03:51,921 --> 01:03:55,254
What was so special about the girl?
Describe her!

613
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,291
I don't remember, Third Sister

614
01:03:57,426 --> 01:03:58,484
Please don't toy with me!

615
01:03:58,694 --> 01:04:00,127
But I want to toy with you!

616
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:02,229
You'll never leave here
if you don't tell me!

617
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:06,724
Look, I have so many books here

618
01:04:07,436 --> 01:04:11,304
Find one which helps you describe her

619
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:17,542
Lock up!

620
01:04:24,287 --> 01:04:26,050
Can you read?

621
01:04:28,391 --> 01:04:29,688
That's good

622
01:05:11,334 --> 01:05:14,565
"TRIADS: THE TRUE STORY"

623
01:05:22,745 --> 01:05:26,704
"NINE DRAGONS VERSUS
MOUNTAIN LEOPARD"

624
01:05:33,356 --> 01:05:34,516
Found something?

625
01:05:40,696 --> 01:05:42,220
Read it aloud

626
01:05:49,238 --> 01:05:51,672
"She... has delicate white skin

627
01:05:51,874 --> 01:05:54,104
as soft as soap..."

628
01:05:54,510 --> 01:06:02,212
"Her ripe melon breasts are too

629
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,220
lare to grasp..."

630
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:11,158
"Her nipples are so pink..."

631
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:14,793
"Her butt is tight,

632
01:06:15,164 --> 01:06:18,099
firm and shapely"

633
01:06:18,234 --> 01:06:19,428
"The bill... is $360..."

634
01:06:19,568 --> 01:06:23,937
"But she's worth every penny!
Watch for her in Portland Street"

635
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:29,544
"She's number XX
at the Golden... Nightclub"

636
01:06:35,284 --> 01:06:36,751
Bring me that book

637
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,059
"PORNO GUIDE:
THE FLOWER OF PORTLAND STREET"

638
01:06:54,570 --> 01:06:55,594
Let him go

639
01:06:55,805 --> 01:06:56,863
Let him go?

640
01:06:57,373 --> 01:06:58,135
Yes

641
01:06:58,307 --> 01:07:00,400
Thank you, Third Sister!

642
01:07:03,846 --> 01:07:06,872
He's bold, but he has good taste!

643
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:11,779
Bring in the writer for a signing!

644
01:07:12,755 --> 01:07:14,245
Yes

645
01:07:16,192 --> 01:07:19,821
"The Flower of Portland Street"!
Maybe it's me?

646
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,300
Brother Wah, is it true?

647
01:07:33,509 --> 01:07:34,771
Why are you asking?

648
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:38,746
Leopard has come back

649
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:41,876
He dares to come back?

650
01:07:43,752 --> 01:07:45,413
He wants revenge on Nine Dragons

651
01:07:46,288 --> 01:07:48,620
Revenge? For what?

652
01:07:49,525 --> 01:07:52,358
Nine Dragons beat him,
but he wouldn't accept defeat

653
01:07:52,728 --> 01:07:57,358
He was disloyal to his boss,
stole money from his 'brothers'

654
01:07:57,566 --> 01:08:00,763
This idiot dares to come back?

655
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:04,662
Brother Wah, I don't get it

656
01:08:13,349 --> 01:08:17,285
They were both small-time punks

657
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:20,582
They weren't bosses?

658
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:22,452
Bosses?

659
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:24,859
Mountain Leopard did nothing but boast

660
01:08:25,227 --> 01:08:27,991
They were both butchers in the market

661
01:08:28,164 --> 01:08:33,329
One sold pork, one sold beef...
They were rivals

662
01:08:33,936 --> 01:08:36,097
The night the Roxy opened...

663
01:08:36,672 --> 01:08:38,936
...they both came itching for a fight

664
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:41,635
It's said they fought over a bar-girl

665
01:08:41,944 --> 01:08:44,606
But any excuse would have done

666
01:08:46,182 --> 01:08:49,117
Leopard couldn't fight at all

667
01:08:49,752 --> 01:08:51,481
Isn't he a kung-fu master?

668
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:55,278
Him? He don't know shit!

669
01:08:55,824 --> 01:08:57,621
Get off me!

670
01:09:02,698 --> 01:09:06,065
I don't know why,
but someone blew some smoke in the air...

671
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:10,564
...and Leopard was galvanised!

672
01:09:16,212 --> 01:09:20,080
A real fierce fight,
like something from a movie!

673
01:09:21,016 --> 01:09:23,382
Leopard was like a new man!

674
01:09:25,087 --> 01:09:26,987
But Nine Dragons finally won

675
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:31,752
You'll never beat me, Fatso!

676
01:09:31,894 --> 01:09:35,421
The bastard couldn't take it,
he shot Nine Dragons in the back

677
01:09:35,864 --> 01:09:38,196
I tried to stop him

678
01:09:39,568 --> 01:09:44,835
I had my arm around Nine Dragons,
that's why I'm this way now

679
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:51,738
So that's why he fled to Brazil?

680
01:09:51,947 --> 01:09:55,280
He thought he'd killed me,
so he ran away

681
01:09:56,518 --> 01:10:01,854
Everyone there swore
they'd get that bastard

682
01:10:04,526 --> 01:10:06,050
And Nine Dragons?

683
01:10:08,364 --> 01:10:11,765
The boss promoted him

684
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,232
He became a big shot

685
01:10:14,436 --> 01:10:17,269
He's now the leader
of the Hung Ying triad

686
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,505
Where is he now?

687
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:25,270
In hospital, he's in a coma

688
01:10:26,982 --> 01:10:28,313
How come?

689
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:33,379
That night of the shooting stars...
we all went to a bar

690
01:10:33,922 --> 01:10:35,890
He went for cigarettes...

691
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:39,091
...and he was knocked down by a car

692
01:10:43,766 --> 01:10:45,427
I have to go

693
01:11:04,653 --> 01:11:06,382
Come by anytime

694
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:11,853
Oh yes... did that bar-girl
stay with Nine Dragons after that?

695
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,287
No

696
01:11:13,762 --> 01:11:16,959
I heard she went to
the Dragon & Phoenix Nightclub

697
01:11:20,202 --> 01:11:21,294
Thank you

698
01:11:51,433 --> 01:11:53,162
This girl is really pretty

699
01:12:00,943 --> 01:12:02,035
Dee Dee's been waiting for you

700
01:12:02,177 --> 01:12:03,940
I'm not the only one in your heart!

701
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,246
She was bored, so I put on your tapes

702
01:12:08,050 --> 01:12:10,575
She says that woman cop once nabbed you,
is that right?

703
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,149
You fancy her, but you're afraid
she'd arrest you... right?

704
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,417
Piss off!

705
01:12:17,893 --> 01:12:20,885
Piss off, I won't help you any more

706
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:25,157
Come on, own up to fancying her!

707
01:12:25,768 --> 01:12:27,292
Don't behave like a dog!

708
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:29,664
Me?!

709
01:12:30,038 --> 01:12:32,199
Who shot a guy in the back
after being beaten? You're the dog!

710
01:12:38,247 --> 01:12:39,407
You found Nine Dragons?

711
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,610
You were just a market butcher!

712
01:12:42,818 --> 01:12:45,480
Losing a fight is okay,
but you ran away...

713
01:12:45,721 --> 01:12:48,053
...thinking you'd killed someone!

714
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:52,824
Now you dare come back
and talk about honour!

715
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:54,752
Played the victim to win my sympathy!

716
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:56,420
Get out!

717
01:12:56,899 --> 01:13:00,266
And you have the gall
to ask me to kill Nine Dragons!

718
01:13:00,903 --> 01:13:02,768
You're the lowest of the low

719
01:13:02,905 --> 01:13:05,669
Take me to him,
I have to see Nine Dragons!

720
01:13:06,909 --> 01:13:08,968
You don't dare shoot me?

721
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:11,374
You, with your long record?

722
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,645
You betrayed your boss, stole money...

723
01:13:14,783 --> 01:13:16,444
Cheated your friends,
stole a guy's mistress...

724
01:13:16,652 --> 01:13:19,246
I never stole anyone's mistress, never!

725
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:22,055
Probably not, you're such a worm!

726
01:13:23,959 --> 01:13:26,120
Can you even remember what you did?

727
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:28,252
Can you remember what you ate last week?

728
01:13:28,397 --> 01:13:30,957
There's so much to remember,
stay with the good things!

729
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:33,294
What good things are those?

730
01:13:33,635 --> 01:13:37,662
You just boast about everything!
What's good about you?

731
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:42,071
Stuck on a woman you don't even know!

732
01:13:42,845 --> 01:13:46,042
I've dreamed of her
every night for years

733
01:13:46,181 --> 01:13:47,671
Of course I know her!

734
01:13:47,883 --> 01:13:49,441
You had no relationship!

735
01:13:52,855 --> 01:13:55,255
Thank God you're not my father

736
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,488
If you were,
I'd be ashamed to show my face!

737
01:13:59,561 --> 01:14:03,327
Take me to see him! I have no time left!

738
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,391
I'm a dog, I'll shoot you!

739
01:14:11,607 --> 01:14:13,939
You still dare to see him?

740
01:14:28,123 --> 01:14:29,784
Is he the one?

741
01:14:42,471 --> 01:14:43,733
Nine Dragons

742
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:46,170
Nine Dragons...

743
01:14:46,508 --> 01:14:48,499
It's Leopard... Can you hear me?

744
01:14:49,177 --> 01:14:50,542
Nine Dragons!

745
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,639
I must ask you a favour

746
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,345
Tell me, where is she?

747
01:14:57,486 --> 01:15:00,580
That bar-girl, I must see her!

748
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:04,782
Please tell me, I must see her!

749
01:15:04,927 --> 01:15:06,554
Nine Dragons!

750
01:15:07,696 --> 01:15:10,722
I have a gun!

751
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:13,527
Tell me where she is!

752
01:15:13,735 --> 01:15:16,067
Quiet! This is a hospital!

753
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:17,965
Are you a relative?

754
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,801
Good, help me wash him

755
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:25,340
Take off his shirt

756
01:15:43,632 --> 01:15:45,930
Nurse, will he ever come round?

757
01:15:46,335 --> 01:15:48,064
When he recognises you, you'll know

758
01:15:53,508 --> 01:15:57,535
Nine Dragons, do you recognise me?

759
01:15:58,013 --> 01:16:00,504
Nine Dragons, do you recognise me?

760
01:16:01,116 --> 01:16:03,107
Nine Dragons...

761
01:16:03,785 --> 01:16:06,686
You know this girl? Look!

762
01:16:06,888 --> 01:16:10,847
You recognise her?

763
01:16:20,936 --> 01:16:24,838
I must remember this!

764
01:16:29,244 --> 01:16:32,236
I must remember this!

765
01:16:32,381 --> 01:16:33,814
Mister...

766
01:16:34,182 --> 01:16:36,173
Are you alright? Need a doctor?

767
01:17:06,314 --> 01:17:10,250
Keep the map safe, Uncle!
Don't go out without it!

768
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:28,764
This is my place! You live over there!

769
01:20:18,573 --> 01:20:21,565
Smokey, your dad was a cop!

770
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:25,477
What?

771
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:28,478
I remember now, he was a cop

772
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:08,480
My dad was a cop!

773
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,541
I really am sick

774
01:22:37,112 --> 01:22:38,807
I have Alzheimer's

775
01:22:41,016 --> 01:22:42,847
Soon I'll forget everything

776
01:22:44,185 --> 01:22:45,584
I used to believe...

777
01:22:46,554 --> 01:22:50,012
...I'd remember what I'd lost
for the rest of my life

778
01:22:51,993 --> 01:22:55,690
Then I realised God
was playing a cruel joke

779
01:22:57,332 --> 01:22:59,095
"You think you can choose
what to remember?"

780
01:23:01,803 --> 01:23:03,236
What could I do?

781
01:23:07,876 --> 01:23:10,037
I came back...

782
01:23:11,246 --> 01:23:12,975
...not to revenge myself
on Nine Dragons...

783
01:23:14,115 --> 01:23:18,313
...but to see her one last time

784
01:23:20,388 --> 01:23:22,322
While I can still remember

785
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:26,493
Because...

786
01:23:30,265 --> 01:23:33,632
...she's the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen

787
01:23:36,805 --> 01:23:40,400
I asked for your help
because I could see you were a good guy

788
01:23:40,775 --> 01:23:45,075
You helped out a hooker!
I'd never have done that

789
01:23:46,281 --> 01:23:50,684
All I've ever done really is boast

790
01:23:53,188 --> 01:23:55,088
So I hope...

791
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,584
...that while I still
remember this woman...

792
01:24:00,195 --> 01:24:01,890
...I can end my life

793
01:24:02,730 --> 01:24:05,392
I never killed anyone else,
at least I can kill myself

794
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:07,998
Then I'll be able
to carry her memory to the grave

795
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:14,632
My dollar savings are in my bag

796
01:24:16,377 --> 01:24:17,605
They're for you

797
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:22,778
If you ever see my woman...

798
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,349
...please ask her name for me

799
01:24:34,362 --> 01:24:37,297
Please...

800
01:28:13,848 --> 01:28:15,338
I've found your woman!

801
01:28:27,528 --> 01:28:28,893
What do you want?

802
01:28:31,566 --> 01:28:34,763
Nothing, just hand over that guy

803
01:28:35,436 --> 01:28:38,030
All the bosses know he's back in town

804
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,002
Everyone wants to see him

805
01:28:41,042 --> 01:28:42,441
We haven't time now

806
01:28:43,911 --> 01:28:45,401
No time?

807
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:48,041
What's the time now?

808
01:28:48,583 --> 01:28:50,016
No watch

809
01:28:50,551 --> 01:28:53,987
See? Time's not an issue! Get him!

810
01:29:00,728 --> 01:29:02,992
Move, your woman is there!

811
01:29:08,102 --> 01:29:09,501
Get them!

812
01:29:15,576 --> 01:29:18,238
Stop! Stay there!

813
01:29:21,149 --> 01:29:22,639
Shit! Get them!

814
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:33,650
This way!

815
01:29:38,065 --> 01:29:39,225
Over there!

816
01:29:39,834 --> 01:29:40,926
Stop!

817
01:29:45,373 --> 01:29:46,806
Hey, this way!

818
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:55,782
Your woman is up there, come on!

819
01:32:07,148 --> 01:32:08,706
You want to dance?

820
01:33:25,326 --> 01:33:26,520
Stop the car!

821
01:33:31,165 --> 01:33:32,928
How dare you
make trouble in my territory?

822
01:33:33,968 --> 01:33:35,094
Sorry, Third Sister

823
01:33:35,302 --> 01:33:36,564
I didn't know it was your patch

824
01:33:37,271 --> 01:33:40,206
You didn't know? Where are you from?

825
01:33:40,474 --> 01:33:43,409
You don't know your way around
and come on so tough?

826
01:33:43,711 --> 01:33:46,578
Didn't your boss teach you anything?

827
01:33:47,148 --> 01:33:48,342
I've tried my best to learn the rules

828
01:33:48,482 --> 01:33:50,382
You've learned nothing!

829
01:33:50,518 --> 01:33:52,247
This boy is under my protection!

830
01:33:52,453 --> 01:33:54,785
- But the other one...
- I don't care who is him!

831
01:33:55,089 --> 01:33:57,785
I'll be responsible for this, understand?

832
01:34:00,428 --> 01:34:02,589
OK, no problem.

833
01:34:02,897 --> 01:34:05,866
After all, we're all in the same game

834
01:34:06,133 --> 01:34:09,125
When you have time, let's 'buddy up'

835
01:34:09,804 --> 01:34:11,704
Boss, you said that wrong!

836
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:15,408
The one in the wrong
should do the red thing

837
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:18,407
Boss, it's a red pocket!

838
01:34:20,548 --> 01:34:23,745
And invite the other to a banquet, right?

839
01:34:25,286 --> 01:34:27,880
Goddamn buffoon!

840
01:34:45,339 --> 01:34:46,806
What's your name?

841
01:34:47,975 --> 01:34:49,374
Nam

842
01:34:51,378 --> 01:34:53,437
Ah Nam...

843
01:34:59,754 --> 01:35:01,654
I'm going to buy cigarettes

844
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:54,401
What is your name?

845
01:35:55,643 --> 01:35:56,940
Ah Nam...

846
01:35:57,077 --> 01:36:00,376
Ah Nam...

847
01:36:35,082 --> 01:36:37,016
If you do that, you'll be arrested

848
01:36:37,351 --> 01:36:39,080
Let me just finish this...

849
01:36:39,286 --> 01:36:40,253
Old man...

850
01:36:40,387 --> 01:36:42,287
You mustn't write there

851
01:36:42,489 --> 01:36:44,650
You're defacing government property,
I can arrest you for that

852
01:36:44,959 --> 01:36:46,859
Don't you know... who I am?

853
01:36:47,061 --> 01:36:48,085
I'm Emperor of Yaumatei!

854
01:36:48,362 --> 01:36:50,091
Sorry, Officer,
he doesn't know what he's doing

855
01:36:50,297 --> 01:36:51,628
Let's go home!

856
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,491
Young man, wait...

857
01:37:00,374 --> 01:37:02,399
I've seen you somewhere before

858
01:37:04,111 --> 01:37:05,772
No...

859
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,914
You were in a gang
and now you do social work?

860
01:37:09,984 --> 01:37:14,250
I look after Alzheimer's patients now

861
01:37:15,155 --> 01:37:16,622
Good for you

862
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:20,225
First time I've seen you smile

863
01:37:20,728 --> 01:37:22,320
How often have you seen me?

864
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:25,826
I've seen you on TV!

865
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:28,568
- You're on TV every day!
- No...

866
01:37:28,702 --> 01:37:31,569
- I see you day and night.
- He...

867
01:37:31,772 --> 01:37:34,707
- I meet you at last!
- Goodbye!

868
01:37:38,746 --> 01:37:41,772
You've forgotten everything
except her face!

869
01:37:43,183 --> 01:37:45,242
Where are all the US dollars?

870
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:49,245
I don't always... remember

871
01:37:49,523 --> 01:37:52,458
When I do remember, I get lost

872
01:37:52,927 --> 01:37:58,263
When I'm not lost, I'm too busy

873
01:37:58,465 --> 01:38:01,730
And since I don't have time...

874
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:04,694
...I stop thinking about it

875
01:38:05,205 --> 01:38:07,901
Then I forget

876
01:38:08,342 --> 01:38:09,809
- I don't always remember.
- Go...

877
01:38:09,944 --> 01:38:11,343
This is the latest map of Hong Kong

878
01:38:11,478 --> 01:38:13,673
You point, I'll guide you there

879
01:38:14,882 --> 01:38:17,112
It's not an atlas!

880
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:20,950
Stop fooling around!

881
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:23,146
Or I won't tell you stories
over dinner tonight

882
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:27,384
The story of Mountain Leopard
and Nine Dragons?

883
01:38:28,462 --> 01:38:31,192
The one about playing soccer
with Ronaldo when I was young...

884
01:38:32,266 --> 01:38:33,756
What about Beckham?

885
01:38:35,436 --> 01:38:37,666
Beckham, He...

886
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:39,272
He plays rugby now

887
01:38:39,473 --> 01:38:41,065
What?!
