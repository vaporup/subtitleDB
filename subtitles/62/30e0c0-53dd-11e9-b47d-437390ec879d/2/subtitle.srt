1
00:00:05,622 --> 00:00:07,590
So what shall I bring
back for the mother?

2
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,989
What does a mother's heart yearn for?

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,189
Mother's heart? It only yearns
for her son's happiness...

4
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:25,531
no matter where he is... no matter
how he is... just happiness...

5
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:43,951
And a son's happiness is in
his mother's laughter... her smile...

6
00:00:46,196 --> 00:00:48,494
something that he
isn't able to see.

7
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,502
I promise, mother.
The laughter will return...

8
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:04,873
that smile will return.
It's a son's promise.

9
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,648
And a brother's!

10
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:38,643
Your heart aches when your dear ones
go far distances, doesn't it?

11
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:50,354
And when dear ones create distances
in between, it aches even more.

12
00:05:19,102 --> 00:05:22,367
Has your princess woken up?
- Oh yes... Pooja!

13
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:26,175
No one knows her by that name. Call
her what she is called by everyone...

14
00:05:26,776 --> 00:05:27,902
Poo!

15
00:06:20,396 --> 00:06:24,355
You have no right to
look so beautiful.

16
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:34,977
She has arrived, the cunning vixen,
to drop her daughter.

17
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:38,680
After seeing your face in the morning
how can I call it a lovely day?

18
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,187
Liar! Liar! Come here...

19
00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:55,189
Who is it, Anjali?
- Your future daughter-in-law.

20
00:06:55,932 --> 00:06:57,900
Come, let me serve you
some cornflakes.

21
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,552
Anjali... Anjali I need to talk to you.
- What?

22
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,655
This song that you sing every morning.
- So?

23
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,819
It feels very nice.

24
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,635
But the neighbours around
were complaining.

25
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:36,165
I don't sing for them do I? I sing so
that my son learns about our country.

26
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,636
Our Krish has learnt everything.
Say that you have!

27
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:41,977
Yes... I have learnt everything.
- He has learnt nothing...

28
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,510
he knows nothing about our country.
Our religion, our traditions...

29
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,679
our heritage... Move out of my way.
Our country has...

30
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:49,984
Oh stop it Mummy!
What country? Country!

31
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,189
Eh! The country best in the world
is our India... don't ever forget!

32
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,986
OK... I won't say anything.
He's already half an Englishman...

33
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:02,593
when he turns a full one
don't complain to me.

34
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,529
Yes... become just like her!
How do they say it? How do they talk?

35
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,881
Wouldn't it have been better
to have lived in Chandni Chowk?

36
00:08:43,206 --> 00:08:45,470
Let me knot it for you, Jeej!
- Aaaah!

37
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,669
What happened?
- What kind of clothes have you worn?

38
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,183
It's become too long hasn't it?

39
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,380
What now?

40
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,516
Where's the back?

41
00:09:04,394 --> 00:09:06,328
Didi, don't wait for me.

42
00:09:15,038 --> 00:09:17,370
Anjali, Daijaan, come here.

43
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,868
How do you allow Pooja to
go out wearing such little clothes?

44
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:43,262
By the way even the two of you
are looking decent today, I think...

45
00:10:29,946 --> 00:10:32,141
You had worn this even the
day before, hadn't you?

46
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:35,844
It suits you a lot!

47
00:10:56,973 --> 00:10:58,941
Poo... the whole college
runs after Robbie.

48
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,708
He's not my type!

49
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:09,184
Who is your type?
And when will you meet him?

50
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,185
He might meet me anywhere... anytime.

51
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,190
He could be right here somewhere.

52
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,990
Oh God! Who is this... disturbing
Poo so early in the morning!

53
00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:00,260
Who is this who hasn't turned to
give me a second look? Who is he?

54
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,349
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk...

55
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:00,358
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni...

56
00:18:02,965 --> 00:18:03,932
some chatni.

57
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,546
Do you know Rohan, Didi always says
that a married woman is the union of...

58
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,650
a wife and a daughter-in-law.

59
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:32,889
She is a good wife, but she hasn't
managed to be an ideal daughter-in-law

60
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:38,162
And your brother?
Not a day passes...

61
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:41,164
not a moment passes when he
doesn't remember his parents.

62
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,501
But he never says anything. He has
put up their photograph in the house.

63
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,968
But not once has he
turned towards it.

64
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,183
We have made a small world for
ourselves here, Rohan.

65
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,187
If you look from afar
it's filled with happiness...

66
00:19:00,956 --> 00:19:04,483
but the closer you go,
you will find a lot of sorrow.

67
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,198
Why have you come, Rohan?
Why now?

68
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,672
I had promised bhaiyya that I will
never ask where he went or why he went

69
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,276
But today I have realised that
he doesn't think of us as his own.

70
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:37,818
That is a pain I can't bear...
can't bear.

71
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,489
I have left some broken
bonds back home, Pooja

72
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:46,157
that can only attain the status
of a family through my elder brother.

73
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:54,972
I have come to take my brother back...
take my sister-in-law back...

74
00:19:58,213 --> 00:20:00,181
But I can't do this on my own.

75
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:04,849
I will need your support Pooja.

76
00:20:08,223 --> 00:20:11,192
Will you support me?

77
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:23,537
No... No... never!
- He is Sonia's brother.

78
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,373
He's not my brother... And I didn't
even know that Sonia had a brother.

79
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,642
So Sonia, when was this
brother of yours born?

80
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:30,469
Brother? Who's brother?

81
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:35,150
My first brother from India
has come.

82
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:40,150
I mean first cousin.
He can't stay with me...

83
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:53,159
It's only a matter of few days.
At least meet him once.

84
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:57,906
My house isn't a charitable institution
that anyone can stay here.

85
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,175
Daijaan, please explain to her...
- Why are you troubling him? Why?

86
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,639
Oh stop it Aunty.

87
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,838
C'mon, In such a big house can't he...
- Can't stay.

88
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:07,978
This big house has you wearing
really small clothes... that's why.

89
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,547
I don't want any young man staring at
you... And I'm the boss of this house.

90
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,979
And I ring all the bells.
Gosh! What is it?

91
00:21:14,957 --> 00:21:16,925
What is it? I was just
saving you from an evil eye!

92
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:20,853
Who's evil eye?
This whole family is mad.

93
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,199
All the mad people from Chandni Chowk
have moved in here.

94
00:21:26,902 --> 00:21:31,362
Didi, Sonia's brother has just
arrived, he has no place to stay.

95
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:35,805
Can't we give him a
small place in this big house?

96
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,938
Pooja, You know Rahul, don't you?

97
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:44,715
Didi, he has come from India.

98
00:21:47,189 --> 00:21:52,388
From India...
- My great India... remember?

99
00:21:54,196 --> 00:21:56,164
Listen to me...
- No... no...

100
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,963
Just listen to me...
he has come from India.

101
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,496
So? Should I make him sit on my head?
Do you know the population of India?

102
00:22:02,871 --> 00:22:04,839
If all of them shift here, where
will we sleep? Let me do one thing.

103
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,973
I'll go to Heathrow and stand there to
invite everyone arriving from India...

104
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:11,972
saying, 'Please come to my house.
My wife is mad!'

105
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:17,378
He is coming today,
he's coming now, right now!

106
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,313
He is waiting outside and
I'm calling him in...

107
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:26,194
Listen...

108
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,131
Excuse me...

109
00:22:39,241 --> 00:22:46,147
"We shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears..."

110
00:22:46,915 --> 00:22:50,874
"we shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears."

111
00:23:09,204 --> 00:23:14,506
"How helpless are we,
what is this trial by fire..."

112
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,876
"we stand so close
yet we are so far"

113
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,986
"If you are the body,
I am the soul."

114
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:31,122
"I'm your blood..."

115
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,196
"we meet and yet we don't..."

116
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,396
"Oh what an illusion."

117
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:45,134
"It's all your blessings,
whether smiles or tears..."

118
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:51,878
"we shall never part,
through smiles or through tears."

119
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:11,689
My name is Rahul.

120
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,635
My name is Yash.

121
00:24:34,156 --> 00:24:38,183
He will stay with us.
Take his luggage...

122
00:25:20,702 --> 00:25:22,966
And this is your room!

123
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:32,908
And listen...
if you ever need anything...

124
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,112
want anything...
don't bother asking me for it!

125
00:25:40,856 --> 00:25:43,450
Listen...
- What is it?

126
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:59,140
If you want to live in this house
you will have to follow the rules...

127
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:02,807
and regulations of the house.
No coming late and try and...

128
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:06,944
leave as soon as possible.
Dinner at 8 p.m. Or starve the night

129
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:10,149
And... stay away...

130
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:18,148
This is too much... Eh!
What are you staring at?

131
00:26:19,928 --> 00:26:23,625
Say more, Please... it feels nice.
- Eh! Feels nice? Am I singing a song?

132
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,900
Why do you keep calling me
Eh'? I have a name...

133
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:32,164
I know, but I can't say it.
- Why can't you say it?

134
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:35,604
I said, that I can't say it. Didn't I?
- Oh!

135
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,503
So you don't want to take my name
as a sign of respect. That's great.

136
00:26:39,982 --> 00:26:41,950
In that case I should return
the respect too.

137
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,742
Can I call you Bhaiyya?
- Call your father that!

138
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,784
Don't you drag my father into this...
actually you can... you have the right

139
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,854
He got scared! Poo,
I think this one's a little...

140
00:27:02,237 --> 00:27:04,330
I'm mad? You wear this jacket.

141
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:16,081
Rohan, we were waiting for
your call for such a long time.

142
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:25,019
Seems like both of you
are right here with me.

143
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,298
Mad!

144
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,825
The campus is giving me
an accommodation after a week.

145
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:35,294
Right now I'm living with
an Indian family.

146
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,962
Why, an Indian family?

147
00:27:38,673 --> 00:27:41,836
They are very nice people.
When I met them I felt like...

148
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,178
I have known them for years.
A laughing, happy and...

149
00:27:44,546 --> 00:27:48,175
contented family,
like we are... we were...

150
00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:06,690
Is he going to pay for the bill?
Go eat your food... even that's free...

151
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,219
There goes Madonna
early in the morning.

152
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,828
If you are here, who is singing
this prayer in the morning?

153
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:38,162
Goddess Saraswati herself
has incarnated in the house?

154
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,174
What has happened to
Saraswati here?

155
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:53,169
Look what we have done, Pooja?
We have woken them up so early.

156
00:29:53,608 --> 00:29:54,973
Come on... take their blessings.

157
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,170
Salutations Didi... Salutations Jeejaji
- Salutations to you too... Who is this?

158
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:02,973
You are not able to recognise her
because...

159
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,186
You are seeing her fully clothed for
the first time. It's your sister-in-law.

160
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:06,784
You mean our Poo?

161
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,716
Have a laddoo!
Mother has sent them.

162
00:30:13,962 --> 00:30:15,930
I thought I should
keep them as offerings.

163
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,858
Let me do the tika for you.

164
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,864
Won't you get your tika done?

165
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,134
Back home no one leaves
the house without a tika.

166
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:31,145
Mother says it's an auspicious
start for the day.

167
00:30:33,181 --> 00:30:38,141
Mother says?
So then... do it.

168
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,984
Now who has done this?
- Me of course.

169
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,190
I enjoy puncturing tyres.

170
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,528
Was that a joke?
- It was... so?

171
00:31:27,235 --> 00:31:28,463
No I don't want...

172
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:31,900
A guest is equal to a God. And you
can't refuse a lift offered by God.

173
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:33,936
Come on go now.
- I'll take a taxi.

174
00:31:34,175 --> 00:31:35,904
Give me the money you would have
paid the cab.

175
00:31:38,179 --> 00:31:39,703
That I am.

176
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:41,944
Listen... Please come back home
early in the evening.

177
00:31:42,284 --> 00:31:43,911
Why?
- Just!

178
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,144
I have finished...
now let's leave.

179
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:09,176
By the way are you
interested in cricket?

180
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:10,845
Why?

181
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,514
Because there's a match.
India v/s England... at the oval.

182
00:32:16,651 --> 00:32:18,619
It must be the last over.

183
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,088
Is it a stolen car?
- No.

184
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,180
Is it yours?
- Yes.

185
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,186
Then do what pleases you.

186
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,143
Don't say anything now. Anything
can happen at the last minute.

187
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:48,948
You can never bank on India.

188
00:32:56,691 --> 00:33:01,890
Did you call me 'bhaiyya'?
- Why? Should I?

189
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,163
Why? Just drive the car carefully.

190
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:12,404
Hey! We won...
- We will win!

191
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,387
Like every year
Poo will decide on the boy...

192
00:33:26,554 --> 00:33:29,455
who will escort her to the prom.

193
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:39,626
You will be given marks on ten.
To go to the prom with me...

194
00:33:39,834 --> 00:33:42,803
you have to be brilliant in
three departments.

195
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,916
You are not so bad.

196
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,358
I wasn't talking about myself.
I was giving you points.

197
00:34:47,435 --> 00:34:49,403
I will go only with
him to the prom.

198
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,133
Where will he go?

199
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,730
Just fell.

200
00:35:32,814 --> 00:35:36,443
I'm leaving... I'm leaving.

201
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,584
Listen...
I want to say something to you.

202
00:35:45,493 --> 00:35:47,461
Say it fast.
I don't have time.

203
00:35:48,162 --> 00:35:50,130
Should I say it?
- Say it.

204
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,903
Should I?
- Please say.

205
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,639
You have...
- Yes?

206
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:01,641
You have...
- Say it please.

207
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:05,145
Both...
- Both of us.

208
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,943
Both...
- Both...

209
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,150
Both... Both of your
shoes are not matched.

210
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,888
That's the latest fashion.
I don't think you know.

211
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,518
Please tell Didi
not to wait for me.

212
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,366
Where are you?

213
00:37:25,293 --> 00:37:32,495
"From the moment
I set my eyes on you..."

214
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:38,170
"I marked you to be mine"

215
00:37:44,245 --> 00:37:51,549
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

216
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:40,492
"From the moment I set
my eyes on you..."

217
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:44,899
"I marked you to be mine"

218
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:49,632
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

219
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:54,314
"Please say it, you are my soniya"

220
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,206
"From the moment I set
my eyes on you..."

221
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:25,640
"I marked you to be mine"

222
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:30,750
"Don't turn your back on me,
you are mine, only mine"

223
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,146
"I accede, you are my soniya"

224
00:40:23,437 --> 00:40:30,468
"I'm wounded by your love,
that's what makes me act the way I do"

225
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:39,146
"That's a nice line to fool me
But it won't work on me"

226
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:45,515
"It has taken years for us
to meet each other"

227
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,153
"Hope these moments last forever"

228
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:54,500
"this moment of bliss intoxicates me"

229
00:40:55,002 --> 00:40:59,063
"Please say it once, you are my soniya"

230
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:08,171
"I accede, you are my soniya"

231
00:41:44,852 --> 00:41:50,154
"Your presence drives me crazy,
I can't think straight"

232
00:41:54,195 --> 00:42:00,896
"I place you on my eyelashes,
so you are in my dreams forever"

233
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:07,169
"I want to hold you tight"

234
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:11,634
"I am yours forever, I vow today"

235
00:42:12,246 --> 00:42:16,182
"Let's both vow at this moment,
that we'll never love each other less"

236
00:42:18,886 --> 00:42:22,913
"Please say it, you are my soniya"

237
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:03,488
"You, you, you are my sonia,
Hey you are, you are my soniya"

238
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:11,171
One minute, child...
one minute... What happened?

239
00:43:18,212 --> 00:43:20,180
Mr. Vajpayee had called for you...
he wants you back in India.

240
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,258
It's his...
- What's the date today, dad?

241
00:43:31,492 --> 00:43:32,720
6th September.

242
00:43:34,495 --> 00:43:37,362
Pooja, Couldn't you wear
decent clothes at least today?

243
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:39,132
You came in these strange
black clothes.

244
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,925
Do you know everyone was
staring at us in the temple?

245
00:43:41,168 --> 00:43:44,865
If everyone was staring at me instead
of God then it's not my problem.

246
00:43:50,511 --> 00:43:53,480
Did you hear that, Rahul? She speaks
nonsense even on Bauji's birthday?

247
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:55,308
Today is father's birthday.

248
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,520
Today is bauji's birthday?

249
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,962
Look at her... From Poo to Parvati...
What happened to you?

250
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:22,175
Please take it...
it's the offering from the prayer

251
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:28,113
But aren't offerings on
birthday done for the...?

252
00:44:28,649 --> 00:44:31,117
I know. But Bauji
was a very fun loving man...

253
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:34,454
he said even after I go
always remember me on a happy day.

254
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,119
That's why every year on his birthday
Pooja and I've a special prayer for him

255
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:41,119
If he had to see Pooja like this today,
he would've been unconscious.

256
00:44:44,165 --> 00:44:47,532
You must feel sad that he
is no longer with you now.

257
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:49,935
Yes... we do.

258
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:53,937
It's important to have the warmth of
elders in a house...

259
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:59,138
or else a family always feels
incomplete... Isn't it?

260
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:10,149
Don't you miss him?

261
00:45:14,595 --> 00:45:16,153
Don't you miss?

262
00:45:19,266 --> 00:45:20,961
Don't you miss Bauji?

263
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:27,172
You guys haven't had
your breakfast... Pooja, Krishi...

264
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,102
Come on... Please come.

265
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,371
Even you are coming aren't you?

266
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:22,818
I forgot.

267
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:28,830
The one who is not here
is etched in my memory and the one...

268
00:46:30,437 --> 00:46:33,838
who is right here,
I forgot about him.

269
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,307
What present should I give you?

270
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,182
Just return my Nandini back to me.

271
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,919
We have lost each other
in this big house.

272
00:46:54,562 --> 00:46:58,521
Just get back my Nandini for me.

273
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,538
I want nothing else.

274
00:47:08,642 --> 00:47:09,768
Nothing else.

275
00:47:15,482 --> 00:47:16,449
Listen...

276
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:50,445
What's the matter?
Your affection is quite overwhelming.

277
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:54,988
Yes... That's because you are
looking extremely...

278
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,918
what do they call it? 'Sexy'.

279
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:04,694
Krishi will see.

280
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:09,002
By the way, that should have been
my line... Go now.

281
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:11,538
My bag and my coat.
- I'll just get it.

282
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:19,303
Listen, day after tomorrow
it's Karwa Chauth...

283
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,013
Wow! So what am I supposed to do?

284
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:25,207
You don't do anything. Like every year
there's party for indians

285
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,881
You are leaving?

286
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,825
What is it?

287
00:48:46,874 --> 00:48:48,171
He keeps popping up everywhere.

288
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,490
So Karwa Chauth!
- Yes... it's day after tomorrow.

289
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:07,894
So you must have received the Sargi.
- Sargi?

290
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:14,292
Sargi... Don't you know what sargi is?
It's a ritual for karwa chauth...

291
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:16,536
it's something that every mother-in-law
sends for her daughter-in-law.

292
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,007
Hasn't your mother-in-law
sent it for you?

293
00:49:28,248 --> 00:49:31,149
Some elder person of your family
must be sending it to you.

294
00:49:32,186 --> 00:49:33,676
No...

295
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:43,160
Don't worry. This year
you will get your sargi.

296
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:51,700
My mother... she will
explain everything to you.

297
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:02,182
Greetings to you, my child!
- Greetings.

298
00:50:03,217 --> 00:50:05,981
My son speaks so much about
your family that I feel almost like

299
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,189
I'm there with all of you.

300
00:50:10,391 --> 00:50:12,586
He has become a part of
our small family.

301
00:50:14,128 --> 00:50:15,993
I hope he is not
troubling you too much.

302
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:21,201
Dear child, Sargi is something that...

303
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:23,529
every mother-in-law sends
for her daughter-in-law.

304
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:30,132
Some sweets, a few almonds and...

305
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:39,711
signs of marital bliss...
and lots of love.

306
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:51,164
I'll send it to you.

307
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:54,467
I will think I have sent.
It to my daughter-in-law.

308
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:12,516
OK my child I'll hang up now!
- OK.

309
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:50,316
At times why do even strangers
seem like they are your own?

310
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:11,911
And why is it, at times...

311
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,514
that even our own people
become strangers?

312
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:25,188
Listen... Even I have kept
the karwa chauth fast today.

313
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:31,123
For whom?

314
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,134
What's going on there?
- Something that doesn't happen here.

315
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:40,537
Karwa chauth fast?
That too for me?

316
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,806
Why? Who am I of yours?

317
00:52:50,884 --> 00:52:52,852
You don't have the guts
to tell your brother and bhabhi...

318
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,146
how you are related to them...
Trying to be a great tiger before me!

319
00:52:57,324 --> 00:52:58,723
Let go of my hand.

320
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:00,959
Why has he held her hand?
- Let go of my hand.

321
00:53:01,194 --> 00:53:02,491
I let go.

322
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:07,623
What if I tell them?
Today in the presence of everyone...

323
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:14,165
what if I tell them the truth,
what will you do?

324
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:17,442
I don't think you will be able to.
You are scared.

325
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:21,309
What if I do?

326
00:53:21,882 --> 00:53:24,350
Then I will tell
everyone what's in my heart.

327
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:29,379
Really? Is that so?
- It's a bet.

328
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:32,387
Don't bet with me,
you might regret.

329
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:37,358
Maybe that's what I want.

330
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,931
But looking at you...

331
00:53:44,171 --> 00:53:46,139
I wonder if all this is a dream.

332
00:53:46,573 --> 00:53:47,540
Dream?

333
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:51,910
Yes... How can anyone
be so frightened?

334
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,292
Your turn.

335
00:55:27,474 --> 00:55:32,434
"My trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours"

336
00:55:44,157 --> 00:55:49,925
"I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours"

337
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:58,501
"Take me away...
oh darling take me away"

338
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:29,498
"My trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours,"

339
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:36,506
"I can't spend a minute without you,
Oh I am yours"

340
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,702
"Take me away,
oh darling take me away."

341
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:53,592
"Your trinkets tinkle...
they say I am yours..."

342
00:56:56,863 --> 00:57:01,197
"can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours"

343
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:05,465
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away"

344
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:47,942
"I can't think of a life
without you,"

345
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:53,175
"I spend sleepless nights
counting stars in the sky,"

346
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:58,187
"my heart keeps calling out to you,
my bindiya makes a sign,"

347
00:58:01,161 --> 00:58:08,192
"The shimmering bindiya,
shines like a star next to the moon,"

348
00:58:13,607 --> 00:58:17,566
"My anklets call out to you,
try to make up to you as you sulk,"

349
00:58:18,111 --> 00:58:23,014
"Oh my loved, my beloved.
Try and understand..."

350
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,548
"what I'm trying to say"

351
00:58:26,353 --> 00:58:33,156
"Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours"

352
00:58:36,396 --> 00:58:40,560
"Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours."

353
00:58:41,201 --> 00:58:44,500
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away."

354
00:59:15,735 --> 00:59:18,203
"May we be in
marital bliss forever..."

355
00:59:20,674 --> 00:59:23,199
"may our soul mates be
with us forever"

356
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:30,139
"Now that you have entered my world,
never leave"

357
00:59:30,583 --> 00:59:35,145
"Take my hand and ask me
to be yours forever"

358
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:47,156
"Oh darling you look so beautiful,
seems like you have been made for me"

359
00:59:50,203 --> 00:59:54,640
"Your beauty shines so brightly,
that it shames the moon"

360
00:59:57,978 --> 01:00:02,540
"Go away you liar, I'm not taken in"

361
01:00:02,916 --> 01:00:07,182
"Don't flatter too much,
your giving yourself away"

362
01:00:17,497 --> 01:00:21,934
"I wish from the bottom of my heart,
may your pair be forever"

363
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:29,471
"Oh my love, my beloved, wish
we spent our lives together forever"

364
01:00:35,215 --> 01:00:42,519
"Your trinkets tinkle,
they say I am yours"

365
01:00:45,191 --> 01:00:49,719
"Can't spend a moment without you,
Oh I am yours"

366
01:00:50,196 --> 01:00:53,495
"Take me away, oh darling,
take me away"

367
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,617
You are mad!

368
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,953
My son has turned into
a complete Englishman.

369
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,815
No. Not at all.

370
01:02:57,190 --> 01:03:00,159
Really, Aunty... Sometimes
I wish we were living in India.

371
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,827
And Krishi would sing the
same songs that I grew up singing.

372
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:10,902
But we are here and I have become
'mummy' from a mother.

373
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:13,897
Why do you think so, Anjali?
Whatever the tongue...

374
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,674
the culture is yours, isn't it?

375
01:03:15,909 --> 01:03:20,972
Still... It's not the same, Aunty...
...Just see... Coming!

376
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:26,585
Mad!

377
01:03:27,654 --> 01:03:31,454
By the way, D... j... Daijaan,
What are these children doing?

378
01:03:33,159 --> 01:03:36,856
There's a function in Baba's school.
They are rehearsing for that.

379
01:03:37,664 --> 01:03:40,394
All of us are going for it.
You will come with us, won't you?

380
01:03:46,306 --> 01:03:47,933
I'll just be back.

381
01:03:58,551 --> 01:04:00,143
What do I do with this?

382
01:04:11,998 --> 01:04:13,966
What are you doing?
I'll manage myself.

383
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,167
Leave it Daijaan,
I'll manage myself.

384
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:20,969
I'll do it myself... Daijaan...
Daijaan... DJ!

385
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:32,575
My little child! My child!

386
01:04:35,555 --> 01:04:40,117
I knew it...
My heart kept telling me

387
01:04:41,494 --> 01:04:47,524
that it was my Baba. Oh Allah!
How big you've grown up to be.

388
01:04:52,405 --> 01:04:55,863
You hid it from your DJ too?
You didn't even tell me?

389
01:04:56,542 --> 01:04:59,409
Why? My child, why?

390
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:07,142
Didn't I keep telling you, Anjali?
See, it's my little child!

391
01:05:08,888 --> 01:05:13,484
It's my child.
You have come back to me.

392
01:05:23,202 --> 01:05:24,499
My child!

393
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,617
Just coming!

394
01:05:54,167 --> 01:05:55,464
Just coming!

395
01:06:18,891 --> 01:06:20,324
Oh! Where is Didi?
Where's she gone?

396
01:06:30,203 --> 01:06:31,966
Oh my God! Is this our table?

397
01:06:32,205 --> 01:06:34,002
They do this all the time.
Look at this, Aunty,

398
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,675
They give the front seats to the
shining white army and seat us behind.

399
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:39,037
Why do they do it
always? No... Aunty,

400
01:06:39,345 --> 01:06:41,176
Where is that silly principle?

401
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,915
She has arrived, the cunning vixen.

402
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:56,187
Is she the Queen of England that
she's got the table in the front?

403
01:07:02,235 --> 01:07:05,204
Please go you silly woman...
Hope your table starts shaking...

404
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,996
hope your chair breaks to pieces.

405
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:13,007
Should we sit?

406
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:21,982
Already there have been a
lot of complaints.

407
01:07:22,255 --> 01:07:24,485
Even last year at this function
you had created a ruckus!

408
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,425
Krishi is performing... Very nice...
what's the big deal?

409
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,358
You just shut up and stop
this Englishwoman act of yours!

410
01:07:31,564 --> 01:07:33,156
Anjali, she's right!
- You keep quiet.

411
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:36,163
My son's on stage...
I will at least whistle once.

412
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:38,504
No... No...
- Just one whistle...

413
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:04,520
How sweet my son looks!
He looks just like you, sweetoo!

414
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,193
God, Please protect my son.

415
01:08:11,604 --> 01:08:13,936
Eh! Your son is just performing...
not fighting a war on the border.

416
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,208
Just see!
- Just see!

417
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:24,212
My son! My son!
- Even mine.

418
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:28,550
Now sing your, 'Do Re Mi'.

419
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:58,162
Did you do this?

420
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,791
Now tell me something...
You must have been a little nervous?

421
01:11:25,131 --> 01:11:27,929
I was a little nervous.
But someone said something to me...

422
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:29,928
and everything was alright.

423
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,129
What did the person say?
- Just a minute.

424
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:38,940
If you want to be someone in life...
if you want to achieve something...

425
01:11:39,445 --> 01:11:41,879
If you want to win, always
listen to your hear.

426
01:11:42,415 --> 01:11:44,144
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

427
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:47,649
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

428
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:51,488
And then you will
cross all the hurdles...

429
01:11:52,191 --> 01:11:55,160
all your problems will vanish,
victory will be yours...

430
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:57,525
only yours.

431
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,559
Who said this? Papa?
- No. He.

432
01:12:36,168 --> 01:12:38,136
Did you take care of mother?

433
01:12:45,177 --> 01:12:47,145
Did you get selected
in the cricket team?

434
01:12:57,189 --> 01:12:59,851
How did you manage
to lose so much weight?

435
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:13,165
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

436
01:13:13,572 --> 01:13:17,838
Come back home, Bhaiyya.
Please come back home.

437
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:21,179
Come back home, Bhaiyya.

438
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,980
Has Papa sent you?

439
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:36,720
Rohan, now this is my family.

440
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,591
These are my people.
This is my world!

441
01:13:46,906 --> 01:13:51,468
And the home you are talking about
was never mine in the first place...

442
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:57,149
and will never be.

443
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:03,815
You go back now... just go back.
You...

444
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:10,151
I have seen you again,
that's enough for me.

445
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,157
Go back.

446
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:25,975
Do you know Bhaiyya,
you often said when I was a child

447
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,515
That mother loved you more than me.

448
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,112
I never liked it then.

449
01:14:38,524 --> 01:14:40,116
I used to get angry.

450
01:14:43,596 --> 01:14:45,928
But today, I would like to tell you,
that you were right.

451
01:14:49,168 --> 01:14:51,136
Mother loves you more than me.

452
01:14:54,173 --> 01:14:59,133
She loves you too much.
And she will always.

453
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:05,150
She will always
- I know.

454
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:13,155
He hasn't forgotten Dad's words.

455
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:20,961
He will never come back.

456
01:15:26,205 --> 01:15:30,107
He will come Rohan.
He will definitely come back.

457
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:33,478
I know my brother-in-law well.

458
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:37,445
Just get him to meet
mother and father.

459
01:15:43,155 --> 01:15:45,123
Will you be able to do that?

460
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:59,535
You know, dad...
I had a strange dream last night.

461
01:16:00,572 --> 01:16:03,132
I dreamt that you and Mom had come
to London to surprise me.

462
01:16:04,576 --> 01:16:05,941
Then?
- What then, dad?

463
01:16:06,178 --> 01:16:08,476
The alarm went off... I mean...

464
01:16:09,181 --> 01:16:11,149
why would you and Mom come to
London to surprise me?

465
01:16:17,356 --> 01:16:18,653
I'll speak to you later

466
01:16:28,534 --> 01:16:30,161
The work's done.

467
01:16:45,217 --> 01:16:47,048
Guess where we are.
- Where, dad?

468
01:16:50,956 --> 01:16:53,982
Is it ever possible that my son dreams
of something and I don't turn it true.

469
01:16:55,494 --> 01:16:57,587
Tell me where you are right now,
we want to meet you just now...

470
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:00,994
You are meeting me
after such a long time.

471
01:17:02,468 --> 01:17:05,801
Present? Now...
at this time... here...

472
01:17:06,138 --> 01:17:08,106
You meet me at 5 p.m. At
the Blue water Shopping mall.

473
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,608
But tell me what
you want, my child.

474
01:17:10,976 --> 01:17:13,945
You will find what
I want right there, Dad.

475
01:17:31,864 --> 01:17:33,297
What's happening here?
- I'm looking for the receipts.

476
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,500
What receipts?
- To return the clothes.

477
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,836
If you have to return them, why do you
buy them in the first place?

478
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,966
The country best in the world
is our India... Right Mom?

479
01:17:41,206 --> 01:17:42,173
Mother's stooge!

480
01:17:47,546 --> 01:17:49,673
Did you tape that? That Indian serial,
Kyon Ki Saas Bhi kabhi bahu thi.

481
01:17:50,115 --> 01:17:51,980
What a brilliant twist!
The son dies.

482
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:55,186
Oh God! Really? Oh No...
You have given away the suspense.

483
01:17:58,223 --> 01:18:00,191
What are you doing?
- It's fine till the hugs

484
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:02,927
- but he keeps kissing me too.
- You have never kissed me so much.

485
01:18:03,228 --> 01:18:05,196
Come home, darling... and see.

486
01:22:37,469 --> 01:22:41,132
Lies! You lied to me.

487
01:22:42,641 --> 01:22:45,132
Yes... I lied to you, Dad.

488
01:22:46,511 --> 01:22:48,479
What would I have achieved even if
I had told truth.

489
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:51,141
I wouldn't be able to break
your ego.

490
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,686
What else is it if not ego, Dad?

491
01:22:55,187 --> 01:22:58,247
That separates a mother from her child
that takes away...

492
01:22:58,523 --> 01:23:01,754
a brother from his sibling... that
throws a father away from his son...?

493
01:23:02,027 --> 01:23:05,485
He is not my son!
I don't believe that he is my son.

494
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,399
Has he fulfilled the duties
of a son? He didn't.

495
01:23:09,534 --> 01:23:12,628
He did, Dad... he did.

496
01:23:16,007 --> 01:23:17,770
He always fulfilled them.

497
01:23:19,878 --> 01:23:24,178
He only made one mistake... Love.

498
01:23:26,218 --> 01:23:28,778
If that is a crime according to
your law, so be it.

499
01:23:30,555 --> 01:23:33,388
But isn't it your duty as an elder
to forgive him for his mistake?

500
01:23:36,962 --> 01:23:38,930
But you came down to punishing him.

501
01:23:43,168 --> 01:23:45,136
What kind of punishment is this, Dad?

502
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:50,937
What punishment is this?

503
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:59,942
Just look into my eyes and say that...

504
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:02,153
you don't feel the pain
of parting with him.

505
01:24:04,089 --> 01:24:05,954
Say that you don't remember him.

506
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,154
Say that you don't love him.

507
01:24:11,530 --> 01:24:14,260
Say it, Dad. Say it.

508
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:19,496
I don't love him.
I don't love him.

509
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:22,434
I said it, didn't I?

510
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:41,120
God has blessed you
with everything, Dad... Everything.

511
01:24:44,763 --> 01:24:46,526
I just wish he had given you a heart!
- Shut up!

512
01:24:48,066 --> 01:24:49,397
You irreverent child!

513
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,938
You love him.

514
01:25:02,614 --> 01:25:06,141
You love him a lot.
You love him a lot.

515
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:15,148
I have got my answer.
You really love him.

516
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:20,424
Let's go back, Rahul.

517
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:25,499
It's too much now...
This is not our country.

518
01:25:26,137 --> 01:25:30,597
These are not our people.
We have set up a house here...

519
01:25:31,142 --> 01:25:34,111
but have you ever wondered
what kind of a home is this...

520
01:25:36,147 --> 01:25:39,116
that doesn't have a mother's
warmth or a father's blessings?

521
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:46,117
Let's go back, Rahul.
Mother and Father are here...

522
01:25:47,158 --> 01:25:52,596
They are right here.
They are elders.

523
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:59,728
They are a little angry with us.
But we will ask for forgiveness.

524
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:06,132
Rahul... I know
they are as incomplete without us...

525
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:09,146
as we are without them.

526
01:26:10,181 --> 01:26:13,150
We will ask for forgiveness, Rahul.
Let's go back.

527
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,421
You will never understand.

528
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,889
To turn a stranger into your own...

529
01:26:29,534 --> 01:26:31,502
and then to turn him back
to a stranger...

530
01:26:34,205 --> 01:26:36,173
you can never understand the pain.

531
01:26:38,376 --> 01:26:41,345
I agree they are elders...

532
01:26:44,215 --> 01:26:46,513
but even they don't have the right
to break a heart.

533
01:26:50,221 --> 01:26:52,519
Even they don't have
a right to break a heart.

534
01:27:15,380 --> 01:27:17,348
I think we should call him back.

535
01:28:00,325 --> 01:28:04,989
Yash, It was her last wish
to have Rahul...

536
01:28:06,231 --> 01:28:09,428
Just wait for a while... I
know he will definitely come.

537
01:28:11,403 --> 01:28:14,201
We don't need to wait
for anyone... Rohan.

538
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,570
Rahul and Anjali are leaving.

539
01:29:23,241 --> 01:29:25,209
They are leaving tomorrow from here.

540
01:29:27,545 --> 01:29:29,513
They haven't even come home.

541
01:29:35,253 --> 01:29:36,550
If you say to them...

542
01:29:55,473 --> 01:30:00,501
Do you know mother always
says that...

543
01:30:02,213 --> 01:30:03,976
a husband is God.

544
01:30:05,617 --> 01:30:09,576
No matter what he says...
no matter what he thinks...

545
01:30:10,522 --> 01:30:12,183
he is always right.

546
01:30:13,892 --> 01:30:17,919
You brought Rahul home one day...
right.

547
01:30:20,231 --> 01:30:28,138
We gave him lots of love... right.
He became a part of our family.

548
01:30:31,442 --> 01:30:37,142
He became my life...
right... absolutely right!

549
01:30:41,052 --> 01:30:45,955
Then... one day he left home
and went away.

550
01:30:48,593 --> 01:30:49,560
Wrong

551
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:56,156
You let him leave... wrong

552
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:04,164
You separated a mother from
her child... wrong.

553
01:31:07,545 --> 01:31:13,506
Our family shattered
to pieces... wrong.

554
01:31:17,956 --> 01:31:20,186
Then how does a husband become God?

555
01:31:25,296 --> 01:31:27,457
God can't do any wrong can he?

556
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:40,933
My husband is just a husband...
just a husband... Not God.

557
01:31:45,984 --> 01:31:47,417
Not God.

558
01:31:50,355 --> 01:31:51,652
Nandini!

559
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:58,754
I said it... Didn't I?
That's it!

560
01:32:39,404 --> 01:32:41,372
Ever since the day you left,
Bhaiyya...

561
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:44,137
mother has only seen you
through His eyes.

562
01:32:46,978 --> 01:32:48,138
He is the one who gave a mother...

563
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:50,611
the strength to stay away
from her son.

564
01:32:53,184 --> 01:32:55,152
Please swear on Him, Bhaiyya...

565
01:32:57,188 --> 01:32:59,156
that you will come home
at least once.

566
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:02,490
Just once, Bhaiyya.

567
01:33:04,195 --> 01:33:08,689
Even if it is for a moment.
Even if it is for a day.

568
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:13,166
Let Bhabhi feel
at least once that

569
01:33:13,371 --> 01:33:15,339
she is the daughter-in-law
of this family.

570
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:19,176
She is a part of the family.

571
01:33:20,211 --> 01:33:22,304
At least let your shadow fall
on the photograph...

572
01:33:22,547 --> 01:33:25,175
that has kept your memory alive in
mother's eyes for the last ten years.

573
01:33:31,155 --> 01:33:36,115
Just once, Bhaiyya.
Then you can leave

574
01:33:37,962 --> 01:33:42,126
No one will stop you.
No one will stop you.

575
01:33:47,271 --> 01:33:49,239
On the strength of that one memory...

576
01:33:49,574 --> 01:33:54,307
that one moment... Mother
can lead her entire life.

577
01:33:58,349 --> 01:34:00,544
Can't you do just this
much for mother?

578
01:38:20,578 --> 01:38:22,876
You took my words so much to heart
that you went away.

579
01:38:24,982 --> 01:38:29,749
Didn't even look back once.
Didn't come back even once.

580
01:38:31,622 --> 01:38:33,146
Didn't come back.

581
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:36,960
Where did you call
me back, Papa?

582
01:38:40,598 --> 01:38:42,429
Did I have to call you back?

583
01:38:43,601 --> 01:38:45,330
Am I not elder?
Do I have to call you back?

584
01:38:45,569 --> 01:38:46,968
Am I not elder?

585
01:38:49,273 --> 01:38:51,173
I thought you didn't love me.

586
01:38:52,209 --> 01:38:54,074
I thought you didn't
think of me as your son.

587
01:38:54,378 --> 01:38:57,905
How could you think that?
How could you?

588
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:04,178
I brought you into this house for
the first time with these hands.

589
01:39:06,223 --> 01:39:09,192
You completed our family.
You fulfilled all our dreams.

590
01:39:10,961 --> 01:39:12,121
How did you think...?

591
01:39:12,363 --> 01:39:16,197
I thought you didn't love me...
didn't love me.

592
01:39:18,235 --> 01:39:22,535
I love you very much,
my son... love you very much.

593
01:39:25,309 --> 01:39:31,145
Just... just couldn't say it.

594
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:38,151
In these ten years I have thought
about you every moment every day.

595
01:39:39,457 --> 01:39:43,416
I thought of you so much that,
I felt like embracing you and...

596
01:39:43,661 --> 01:39:45,629
telling you how much I love you.

597
01:39:51,202 --> 01:39:52,965
Just couldn't say it.

598
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:01,167
Elders' anger is a part of...
their love, my son.

599
01:40:03,114 --> 01:40:06,914
You took it so much to heart that
you got angry and left home...?

600
01:40:08,886 --> 01:40:10,854
And I didn't even call you back.

601
01:40:12,556 --> 01:40:15,923
Why would you call me?
I should have come on my own.

602
01:40:16,227 --> 01:40:18,593
Yes...
- I should have come on my own.

603
01:40:20,498 --> 01:40:23,934
Why didn't you come?
Why didn't you?

604
01:40:24,502 --> 01:40:27,528
This is your home...
You are the elder son of the family...

605
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:29,873
You are my son... my son.

606
01:40:33,344 --> 01:40:40,477
And now I have grown old my son.

607
01:40:42,420 --> 01:40:44,149
I have grown old.

608
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:48,918
At least forgive me now.

609
01:40:51,529 --> 01:40:56,660
At least forgive me
now... At least now.

610
01:41:35,172 --> 01:41:37,140
Come here, son.

611
01:41:46,517 --> 01:41:47,745
Son...

612
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:54,150
At times the youngsters
in the house show the right...

613
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:56,493
path to the elders in the family.

614
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:03,155
I kept you away from your brother
for years.

615
01:42:08,539 --> 01:42:12,498
Please forgive me if you can.

616
01:42:13,944 --> 01:42:16,174
Forgive me... forgive me.
