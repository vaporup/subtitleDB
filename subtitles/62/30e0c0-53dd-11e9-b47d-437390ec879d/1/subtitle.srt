1
00:00:57,568 --> 00:01:00,696
Why is it that a father is
never able to tell his son...

2
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:03,034
how much he loves him?

3
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:08,369
He's never able to embrace him
and say 'I love you my son'?

4
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,137
And the mother?

5
00:01:10,347 --> 00:01:14,784
She keeps repeating it, whether
her son listens to it or not.

6
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:19,287
But that doesn't mean
a father loves his son any less.

7
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,054
No one can fathom the amount of love
that a mother has for her son...

8
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,827
not even the mother.

9
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:28,064
Because there is no measure
for a mother's love.

10
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:31,060
It's an emotion
that can only be felt...

11
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,059
a mother's emotion.

12
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,066
Rahul, my son... my life!

13
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,538
The match between Woodstock
International and Manor House...

14
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,504
is at a very interesting turn.
5 runs and one ball...

15
00:04:25,843 --> 00:04:28,539
Can Woodstock International's 9-year
victory spell be broken in just a ball?

16
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,947
Captain Vivek Singh spreads his field
towards the boundaries...

17
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:33,443
...and the two batsmen
take their positions.

18
00:04:33,817 --> 00:04:35,580
The excitement among the students
is rising.

19
00:04:35,953 --> 00:04:37,386
The tension is mounting.

20
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:40,556
Manor House needs five runs
in one ball... Will Rohan do it?

21
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:48,797
It's up to Rohan to break.

22
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,727
Woodstock International's nine-year
spell of victory... Seems impossible.

23
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:54,798
Nothing is impossible. The entire game
rests on Rohan's shoulders.

24
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,869
Manor House is confident that
Rohan will do it!

25
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,628
if you want to be someone in life,
if you want to achieve something...

26
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,632
if you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

27
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,774
And if your heart
doesn't give you any answers,

28
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:36,045
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

29
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:40,714
And then you will cross
all the hurdles...

30
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:44,448
all your problems will vanish...
victory will be yours.

31
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:46,519
Only yours.

32
00:06:51,455 --> 00:06:53,423
Hey, Mom and Dad...
I won I won...

33
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,717
I was the Man of the match...
Hey Dad...

34
00:06:58,095 --> 00:07:00,063
I watched you on CNN.
You looked great.

35
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,659
Now I know where I get
my good looks from.

36
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,733
Anyway, I have just completed
my final term and...

37
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:08,504
I'm coming home for Diwali.
Can't wait to see you guys.

38
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:10,396
Lots of Love, Rohan.

39
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,009
P. S... Before I come home
I'm stopping at Hardwar to meet...

40
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,013
my two favourite girlfriends.

41
00:07:24,454 --> 00:07:27,355
Hardwar?
Who are these girlfriends in Hardwar?

42
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:31,020
My two grandmothers...
maternal and paternal!

43
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,215
...8 a.m.

44
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:07,997
Are you watching the photograph and
crying again?

45
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:09,996
Where am I crying?

46
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,995
Of course not...
Where are you crying?

47
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,133
That's one truth and the other one is
that you are very young...

48
00:08:16,473 --> 00:08:18,668
Stop joking with me
early in the morning...

49
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,805
What's the matter, Lajoji?

50
00:08:21,945 --> 00:08:24,004
I remember Rahul
very often these days.

51
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,811
Even I remember him.

52
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:28,409
But in the last few days...

53
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,415
I have been feeling
very restless with his memories.

54
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,814
But why?

55
00:08:32,122 --> 00:08:34,750
Listen...
We have lived our full lives.

56
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:37,618
Speak for yourself... I have
a long life ahead... Touchwood!

57
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes...
But I have to reach God's abode...

58
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:43,325
How will I face Him there?

59
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:47,833
How will I explain the reason, why
I couldn't unite my scattered family?

60
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:51,033
That I couldn't bring
my grandson back home?

61
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,704
How will I show my face to Him?

62
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,208
Don't worry about it.

63
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,605
You are not going to meet God anyway...
- Why?

64
00:08:59,983 --> 00:09:01,780
Because he doesn't meet anyone
in Hell...

65
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:06,516
God... again your jokes
early in the morning...

66
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:07,985
Hey you sweethearts...

67
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,485
Rohan!

68
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:15,089
Naani.
- My child.

69
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:18,991
What's the matter, Naani?
You look very sexy.

70
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:20,997
I know. Everyone says the same thing.

71
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,738
May you live long.

72
00:09:29,946 --> 00:09:31,675
You have become very weak my son.

73
00:09:32,115 --> 00:09:34,549
Now everyone can't be
as healthy as you are.

74
00:09:34,985 --> 00:09:36,418
Oh! Just Shut up now.

75
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,821
What's the matter, Naani?
- What happened? Is she crying?

76
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:48,123
Then it's fine. I get very worried
when she doesn't weep.

77
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:52,365
Just see... Rohan!
- Oh now stop it you two...

78
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:03,368
Please stop crying Lajoji...
Please stop.

79
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,716
Your tears will raise a lot of
questions in Rohan's mind and...

80
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:09,052
we won't have any answers
to his questions.

81
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,055
What do I do Kaur?
What do I do?

82
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:17,056
Whenever I see Rohan,
I think of Rahul even more

83
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:21,793
Don't you think we should
tell him everything?

84
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:25,067
How can we tell him, Lajoji?
Yash has warned us against it.

85
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:28,897
Rohan was not even in town
when Rahul left home...

86
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:31,066
He doesn't know anything.

87
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,476
I think we should
tell him everything.

88
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,341
Where do we begin?
What do we tell him?

89
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:41,073
He doesn't even know that Rahul was
not born to Yash and Nandini.

90
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,484
He was adopted.

91
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:03,300
Rahul was two days old when
Yash and Nandini brought him home.

92
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:09,167
His tiny footsteps made a place
in all our hearts.

93
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:30,727
He became Nandini's lifeline and
Yash's dream was fulfilled.

94
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:35,371
Nine years later,
when you were born...

95
00:11:36,907 --> 00:11:40,070
we felt that
our family was now complete.

96
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:46,742
I still remember
the astrologer saying that...

97
00:11:47,184 --> 00:11:49,618
you fought destiny to be born.

98
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,089
You would be our strength.

99
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,622
Did Rahul bhaiyya know
that he was...?

100
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:01,696
Rahul was eight years old
when he got to know.

101
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,059
That was when Yash decided that...

102
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,731
the matter would never be mentioned
again in the house...

103
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:41,060
Never again...

104
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:44,507
Rahul was our son.
The eldest son of the house.

105
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:48,070
It was a truth that could
never be changed.

106
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,076
But the fact was mentioned again...
Suddenly.

107
00:12:55,118 --> 00:13:02,820
And that was Rahul's last Diwali with
his family... Last Diwali.

108
00:13:25,982 --> 00:13:28,212
Oh Allah! Rohan baba,
you have become so fat...

109
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:29,851
that nothing fits you anymore.

110
00:13:30,186 --> 00:13:31,619
What's DJ? Say Daijaan.

111
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:45,866
"It's all your blessings"

112
00:13:52,442 --> 00:13:55,639
whether smiles or tears"

113
00:13:56,112 --> 00:14:01,482
"We shall never part,
through smiles or through tears."

114
00:14:46,996 --> 00:14:51,057
"I feel you in every breath
of mine..."

115
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:56,062
"my life is but under your shadow"

116
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,802
"I feel you in every breath
of mine..."

117
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:07,008
"my life is but under your shadow"

118
00:15:07,884 --> 00:15:12,344
"I pray to thee as long as I live"

119
00:15:13,056 --> 00:15:17,823
"It's all your boons...
Whether smiles or tears"

120
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:24,027
"We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears"

121
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:10,163
"We light the lamps of love
at your feet"

122
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,807
"We see you everywhere
in everything we see"

123
00:17:45,174 --> 00:17:49,907
"Our lips chant no name but yours"

124
00:17:50,346 --> 00:17:54,715
"Let our hearts be filled
with nothing but your love"

125
00:17:55,351 --> 00:18:00,186
"It's all your boons...
whether smiles or tears"

126
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:05,989
We shall never part...
through smiles nor through tears"

127
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,435
Hey maa... How do you always sense
my presence much before I arrive?

128
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:42,607
Rahul... just tell me one thing...
Emails, letters, faxes...

129
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,082
I sent you all of these and you
didn't reply to any... very rude.

130
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:48,352
MBA is a tough job, Naina!

131
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,719
Was it only MBA that kept you busy?
Or was there something else?

132
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,885
I mean someone else.

133
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,092
Well... It was more than just
one... you know me...

134
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,901
Ha... You stud you.
- Ya... me stud me.

135
00:21:01,404 --> 00:21:03,634
Tell me Rahul.
- What do you think?

136
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:06,204
I think...
- What do you think?

137
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,711
I think, Rahul...
- What do you think, Naina?

138
00:21:09,078 --> 00:21:12,570
Rahul, I don't think anyone other than
me can waste her time with you.

139
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,917
In any case what do you know
what to do with a girl.

140
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:19,047
Oh really?
Is this done with a girl?

141
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:22,055
Stop it Rahul...
- Tell me...

142
00:21:22,892 --> 00:21:24,621
Did you remember me at all?

143
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:27,562
Should I tell you the truth or lie?
- Lie...

144
00:21:27,997 --> 00:21:32,127
If I have to lie then I'd say I did...
not remember you at all...

145
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,229
How sweet!
- Let's talk about you.

146
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,068
Are you still the same or is
some mad guy interested in you?

147
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:41,838
What do you think?
- I think...

148
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:43,738
What do you think, Rahul?

149
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,081
I think...
- What do you think, Rahul?

150
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:52,417
I think, Naina...
I will beat you to that door.

151
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:56,091
Really?
- Really.

152
00:21:56,526 --> 00:21:57,857
Don't bet on that.

153
00:22:10,973 --> 00:22:12,838
Yes... yes...
Don't you have to go to school?

154
00:22:13,075 --> 00:22:17,375
Thank you... C'mon,
eat this... What's the score?

155
00:22:18,014 --> 00:22:20,847
104 for 6... isn't that great?
- Damn good yaar. How many overs?

156
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,317
God, bhaiyya... I think
India is going to kill England.

157
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,819
Anything can happen
at the last minute.

158
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:32,060
You can't bank on them too much.
You never know with India, Rohan.

159
00:22:33,095 --> 00:22:36,792
Here... take this...
Out Out... What\92s the big deal?

160
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,531
England was out of India in 1947.

161
00:22:40,436 --> 00:22:42,063
DJ... that was a PJ...

162
00:22:43,206 --> 00:22:44,833
Oh Allah...
What are these? Legs or...?

163
00:22:45,107 --> 00:22:46,870
He still hasn't learnt
how to tie his shoe laces?

164
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,508
So what? He's a child yet...
He'll learn...

165
00:22:48,678 --> 00:22:50,805
But if you don't allow him to do it
himself, how will he learn? Fatty.

166
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,677
Why did you come back from London?

167
00:22:54,317 --> 00:22:55,875
What's happening here?

168
00:22:56,118 --> 00:22:58,882
Mom you have over fed Rohan and
turned him into a pumpkin.

169
00:22:59,655 --> 00:23:01,885
Yes, yes please laugh at me...
When I go away to...

170
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:05,093
the boarding school you will all
remember me. Nobody loves me.

171
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:07,825
By the way Fatty...
Mother loves me more than you.

172
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:11,733
- DJ... Just look at him.
- Calm down. He's jealous of you.

173
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,766
Mom, I missed you.
- I missed you too, baby.

174
00:23:18,074 --> 00:23:19,803
You won't leave me again
and go, will you?

175
00:23:20,076 --> 00:23:23,045
I won't, but promise me, you will not
feed me the way you, this pumpkin.

176
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,050
Nandini! Nandini!

177
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,216
Yes... Coming.

178
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,488
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

179
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,857
Who will knot this tie?
- Can't you do even that without me?

180
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:53,064
Here... Now you truly look like
Mrs. Yashvardhan Raichand.

181
00:24:24,206 --> 00:24:26,037
This is for you my son.

182
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:31,039
From today, the Raichand Empire
belongs to you.

183
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,957
Oops, Sorry Dad.
That's your grandfather. Salute him.

184
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:13,010
You know Rahul,
Thirty years ago he said...

185
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:17,748
certain things to me in this chamber,
which I will now repeat to you.

186
00:25:20,563 --> 00:25:23,532
He said life offers you many
paths to choose from.

187
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:27,029
You must always choose
the one that is right...

188
00:25:28,304 --> 00:25:30,602
the one where you don't have to
bend... where you don't fall.

189
00:25:31,807 --> 00:25:33,775
Never take a step in life...

190
00:25:34,076 --> 00:25:37,443
that will bring shame to
your family name or prestige.

191
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:44,043
Anyone can make money but earning
respect is not everyone's cup of tea.

192
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,059
I have not forgotten
his words till today.

193
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,361
Even you should not.

194
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,003
Promise me that you will follow
the traditions of the family.

195
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:13,008
Promise me that you'll never compromise
with the self-respect of our family.

196
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:18,877
I promise papa...

197
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,256
that I will always keep
the family name flying high.

198
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,029
I promise you that I will always
keep you happy... always Papa

199
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:34,036
We have won.

200
00:26:42,445 --> 00:26:44,413
Pooja, Pooja
- What happened?

201
00:26:44,747 --> 00:26:46,544
We have won the match.

202
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:51,046
God, Sachin played so well...
100 runs not out.

203
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,058
Ok now listen, take care
of the shop I will be back.

204
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,849
Haldiraaam!

205
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,329
What a game!
What a game! What a game!

206
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:06,125
What a game!! By the way
what game are we playing?

207
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,570
India has won the match!
- Oh so we have won... How nice.

208
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:11,668
If you didn't know,
what were you dancing for?

209
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:14,569
I was dancing because
all the laddoos...

210
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,812
that my wife made
have been sold.

211
00:27:17,113 --> 00:27:18,740
Sold out? How come?

212
00:27:19,048 --> 00:27:20,879
There was a customer who told me
he wanted to eat laddoos...

213
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,280
that would drive him crazy.

214
00:27:23,953 --> 00:27:26,922
Eating her laddos can cure
people who are insane and...

215
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:30,022
those who are normal become...
- Clean bowled!

216
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,251
It was just a joke...
- Stop it now...

217
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,019
Haven't even started it yet...
- Come on...

218
00:27:34,396 --> 00:27:37,832
Rukhsar!
- Stop shouting so loudly...

219
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:40,194
The groom's side has come to
see Rukhsar for marriage.

220
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,404
Sit down. Salute them.

221
00:27:45,641 --> 00:27:47,836
Grandmom... wake up...
the bride has arrived.

222
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,777
Oh! Masha Allah Masha Allah...

223
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:56,051
Her face is bright like
the full moon.

224
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,714
She is just what I had imagined.

225
00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,422
Well... it's not me... its...
This is my daughter, Rukhsar.

226
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:05,651
What? Fever?

227
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,792
Not fever... mother,
She's Rukhsar!

228
00:28:08,964 --> 00:28:10,226
Oh Rukhsar!

229
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,768
What happen?
- We have won the match.

230
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,007
My daughter's very
quiet and introverted.

231
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:22,402
We have won.
- Allah! What happened?

232
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:24,202
Quiet and introverted... eh?

233
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:28,016
Incidentally, what is her age?

234
00:28:29,385 --> 00:28:30,852
Hundred.
- Grandmom, she says...

235
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:32,816
- she's hundred years old.
- What? Nine years old?

236
00:28:33,055 --> 00:28:37,424
She's going to turn twenty-one soon.
- Well... the blossoming of youth.

237
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,824
Actually we live in Lucknow.
But this is Chandni Chowk,

238
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:46,026
I guess... anyway I forgot to
tell you, my son's name is Ashfaque.

239
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,200
Sachin!
- Sachin?

240
00:28:48,437 --> 00:28:50,029
Sachin? In case there's
someone else in her life...

241
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,403
No! No! Please don't say such things.

242
00:28:54,076 --> 00:28:58,376
It's... her uncle Sachin...
her late uncle Sachin.

243
00:28:58,881 --> 00:29:00,109
She was very attached to him.

244
00:29:00,382 --> 00:29:02,350
She always remembers
him on happy occasions.

245
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:06,310
Sachin...
Poor Sachin...

246
00:29:10,726 --> 00:29:14,992
C'mon you girls...
I'll teach you a lesson...

247
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:16,996
Oh God, Is everything alright?

248
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,597
Forget about me...
tell me what has she done this time?

249
00:29:19,868 --> 00:29:21,165
Ask me what she hasn't.

250
00:29:21,437 --> 00:29:23,132
A nice wedding proposal
would have slipped out of our hands.

251
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,373
What?

252
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:26,341
180 by 100...
your blood pressure is high.

253
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:28,173
You mean BP is high-wigh!

254
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:30,512
Yes, it's high and it's
'why' because of you.

255
00:29:31,347 --> 00:29:33,406
I have just increased the dosage.
Please get these medicines.

256
00:29:37,553 --> 00:29:40,021
Om Bhai, you must take care of yourself.
- This won't do...

257
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:42,482
Yes, Aunty... he just doesn't
take care of himself.

258
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,826
You just keep quiet...
I don't want to talk to you...

259
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,824
Why?
- Why? What is Sayeeda saying?

260
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:51,891
Oh! I wasn't serious at all.
I was just joking.

261
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:55,600
That's surprising...
You have spoilt my two daughters...

262
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:59,531
Aren't they like my children too?
Anyway, leave all this aside.

263
00:30:00,075 --> 00:30:02,805
The good news is that
they liked this mad girl...

264
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:05,046
they have accepted the proposal.
- They have accepted?

265
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,111
Didn't they see you properly?

266
00:30:09,418 --> 00:30:10,385
Shut up!

267
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,110
So you will leave us and go...?

268
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,390
Some day all you girls have to leave.

269
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,792
No way am I leaving
my father and going anywhere.

270
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,061
Even I'm not going.
- So then should I leave?

271
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,795
Why do you speak like this, father?

272
00:30:23,098 --> 00:30:25,191
Some day you have to get married,
my child.

273
00:30:26,101 --> 00:30:28,069
The only prayer
I have to the Lord is that...

274
00:30:28,237 --> 00:30:32,401
the man you marry must
love you even more than I do.

275
00:30:33,108 --> 00:30:34,075
C'mon...

276
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,635
I don't think such
a man exists in this world...

277
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,079
Am I not there?

278
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:43,078
You did not eat, dance or even talk
to anyone at the party tonight.

279
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,350
You didn't even tell me
how beautiful I look tonight.

280
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,077
You look very beautiful, Naina.

281
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:49,084
Really? How sweet!

282
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:51,326
I'm sweet and I also lie very well.

283
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,325
Just go...
- No.

284
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,299
Hey Naina, you look very beautiful.

285
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,768
Are you lying or telling the truth?
- What do you think?

286
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:02,430
I think...
- What do you think?

287
00:31:02,738 --> 00:31:04,296
I think Rahul...
- What do you think?

288
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:06,233
Rahul, I think you should go now.

289
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:08,773
In any case I wasn't planning to come
with you. But thanks for the offer.

290
00:31:13,082 --> 00:31:15,448
Bye... I was lying to you.

291
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:31,725
What's happening, Mom?

292
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:36,063
Nothing much except planning
for Dad's surprise party.

293
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:40,970
Nothing stays in
this child's stomach.

294
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:43,074
That's because there's already
so much in there.

295
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:46,807
Rahul, How come you are
back so early?

296
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:49,584
Mom... These society parties are
very boring.

297
00:31:49,952 --> 00:31:50,884
Really?

298
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,748
In that case you have not taken
after your father in these matters.

299
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:57,619
He used to love such parties...

300
00:31:59,027 --> 00:32:00,824
because there used to be
a lot of girls there...

301
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:03,198
Nandini

302
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:06,766
He used to get very happy
watching those girls.

303
00:32:07,069 --> 00:32:10,596
Nandiniji... If I hadn't
watched those beautiful girls...

304
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:13,205
how would I have found you?
- What did you do?

305
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,177
Your father brought
Nandini's proposal...

306
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:21,048
When he saw her for the first time
he was very pleased...

307
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,520
And said, he approved of her.

308
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,789
But he said we would have
to ask for dowry.

309
00:32:29,892 --> 00:32:32,725
He insisted that the girl should
bring from her parents' house...

310
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:36,223
lots of love and a long,
long ladder.

311
00:32:39,435 --> 00:32:41,062
It's a great tradition.

312
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:43,598
The elders of the house choose
their daughter-in-law.

313
00:32:44,106 --> 00:32:46,074
One can't trust these mad children.

314
00:32:47,776 --> 00:32:50,574
No, Mataji... All that was then.

315
00:32:51,447 --> 00:32:54,883
These days everything has changed.
- Nothing has changed, Nandini.

316
00:32:55,784 --> 00:32:57,752
But these days children make
their choices themselves...

317
00:32:58,353 --> 00:32:59,615
Nothing has changed, Nandini.

318
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:02,756
What I meant was...
- Nothing has changed.

319
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,023
But...
- I said it... didn't I?

320
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,226
That's it!

321
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:23,042
Your beauty is going to steal
his sleep in the nights...

322
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:25,207
Shut up!
- You shut up!

323
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,880
Where is your Ashfaque?

324
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:28,614
I haven't even seen him yet.

325
00:33:28,884 --> 00:33:30,852
Introduce him to me.
Let me see how he looks.

326
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:32,849
He is arriving from
Lucknow today and...

327
00:33:33,088 --> 00:33:35,056
he will come to meet you
as soon as he comes.

328
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,219
Tell me what you thought of him.

329
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,049
Stop this coy bride act now...

330
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:40,861
By the way,
what does he do in Lucknow?

331
00:33:41,096 --> 00:33:42,791
He is a poet.
- A poet?

332
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,861
Then I'll get
along very well with him.

333
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,727
Really? Why?

334
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:49,729
That's because I write
a bit of poetry myself.

335
00:33:51,273 --> 00:33:53,867
A ha... Ustad Anjali Ali Khan.

336
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,872
Let me say a few lines...
- Go on... Go on.

337
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:59,581
What heartache have
I gone through for thee...

338
00:34:01,316 --> 00:34:03,284
What heartache have
I gone through for thee...

339
00:34:03,719 --> 00:34:05,846
On one end is Rukhsar and
the other is Aunteee...

340
00:34:06,188 --> 00:34:07,485
Shut up, you brat.

341
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,023
Do you know that the morning papers
have carried a photograph...

342
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:13,627
- of my boss and his son?
- Really? Can I see?

343
00:34:14,062 --> 00:34:16,496
Wash your hands first...
- Oh God!

344
00:34:17,432 --> 00:34:19,593
Tomorrow is his fiftieth birthday.

345
00:34:20,135 --> 00:34:22,103
There's going to be a big party.
There will be lot of people.

346
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:25,029
I made it very clear to Bhabhiji
that the desserts will...

347
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,040
come from Chandni Chowk. That too
specially made by dear Anjali.

348
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:31,641
Really? And what did she say?
- She agreed.

349
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,775
But now you make sure that
you don't mess things up.

350
00:34:34,082 --> 00:34:36,175
Both Rukhsar and you come to
the party with the kulfi.

351
00:34:36,485 --> 00:34:39,215
Yes we will. Oh God, but
tomorrow is Bauji's birthday too.

352
00:34:39,888 --> 00:34:41,515
So what? Come a little late.

353
00:34:41,924 --> 00:34:43,892
In any case their party is
not going to start early.

354
00:34:44,226 --> 00:34:46,524
Oh Allah! Oh Allah!
Do I have it?

355
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,564
No!
- You don't know anything.

356
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,059
Please dress appropriately
for tomorrow.

357
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:55,061
Yes Ammi, I will wear my new
shimmering, embroidered outfit.

358
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:56,869
Of course... You must.

359
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:58,732
After all everyone in the party
will be dying to know...

360
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,341
what Rukhsar is going to wear...
- Really?

361
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:05,742
C'mon Rukhsar... the gang... Please.
- No... not today.

362
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:08,209
Rukhsar please.
- No... Ammi is not feeling well.

363
00:35:17,392 --> 00:35:18,689
I'll return it.

364
00:35:19,962 --> 00:35:22,021
Your groom is coming
to visit us today, isn't he?

365
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:28,901
Where have we come now? How tacky!

366
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:31,832
You brat. Mother has sent some
medicines for Daijaan.

367
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:33,041
I'll back.

368
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:43,045
Ammi... Stop it now and
go to sleep...

369
00:36:52,087 --> 00:36:53,850
Come back.
- Coming, bauji.

370
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:00,992
Where has Bhaiiya gone?

371
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:09,270
The shop's closed for now.
It will open only at 10.

372
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:11,602
Ashfaque miya.

373
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:27,282
Let me say a couplet.

374
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:33,220
So what if the evil wishes harm...
nothing can happen

375
00:37:37,065 --> 00:37:40,193
The only will that triumphs
is the will of the Lord.

376
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,796
Your turn...

377
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:46,033
Eh, Look up there.

378
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:51,207
Eh, Laddoo...
You can't enter Chandni Chowk.

379
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,081
Why?
- Just...

380
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:56,050
And if you want to enter,
you have to say this:

381
00:37:56,418 --> 00:37:58,386
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty on
a moonlit night in Chandni Chowk

382
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,712
in a silver spoon,
some Chatni... Say it fast.

383
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:03,316
What exactly am I supposed to say?

384
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,787
Never mind... You don't say...
Can I say another one?

385
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:15,167
Love is not an easy path,
understand ye all...

386
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:20,667
It's a trial by fire
to be crossed bravely.

387
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:28,438
Chandu's... spoon's... uncle...

388
00:38:32,287 --> 00:38:34,255
You have come to meet me...
haven't you?

389
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:39,424
Not really...
I came to meet Daijaan.

390
00:38:41,062 --> 00:38:43,758
So you call her
'Daijaan' lovingly... eh?

391
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,030
Of course...
She has brought me up.

392
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:50,598
She has brought you up?

393
00:38:52,007 --> 00:38:54,441
In that case even I must have been
your played in her lap.

394
00:38:56,645 --> 00:39:00,706
Chandu's spoon... silver uncle...
Look up there!

395
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:02,713
Catch him.

396
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:04,781
When's the wedding?
- Who's?

397
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:07,384
Of course yours and hers.

398
00:39:08,356 --> 00:39:10,153
How can I marry Daijaan?

399
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,991
You have a great sense of humour.
And you are cute too.

400
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,729
Bhaiyya... save me.

401
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,993
I'm going to tell Rukhsar that
I liked her Ashfaque miya.

402
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,666
Who is Ashfaque miya?

403
00:39:26,041 --> 00:39:29,841
You are asking me
who Ashfaque miya is?

404
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:32,343
You have a great sense of humour...
You have a great sense of humour...

405
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:38,386
Do you know where
Sayeeda begum lives? No?

406
00:39:40,922 --> 00:39:42,480
Do you know?
- What do I know?

407
00:39:42,724 --> 00:39:44,021
You seem to know everything.

408
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:46,556
Do you know my Aunty?
Your would be mother-in-law...

409
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:49,025
Sayeeda begum... Do you know
where she works?

410
00:39:49,965 --> 00:39:52,024
Big businesses of the big people.

411
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,766
Have you heard of the Raichands?
How could you have heard of them?

412
00:39:55,203 --> 00:39:57,831
Their photo has appeared
in the newspaper today...

413
00:39:58,073 --> 00:39:59,472
Really?
- Yes...

414
00:40:00,508 --> 00:40:01,873
Have you seen it?
- No...

415
00:40:02,077 --> 00:40:04,045
Then come with me...
I'll show you...

416
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:06,276
I don't read the newspapers.
- Here it is.

417
00:40:06,748 --> 00:40:09,308
Yashvardhan Raichand...
a big snob!

418
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:14,784
And this is his son... God!
He looks exactly like you.

419
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:19,389
Show me.
Ah Ashfaque miya.

420
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,056
I'm a dead duck...
- Not at all...

421
00:40:24,332 --> 00:40:27,062
You have a great sense of humour.
You have a great sense of humour.

422
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:31,072
Bhaiyya... I have some
goons running after me.

423
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,345
My younger brother.

424
00:40:44,185 --> 00:40:48,485
Listen... You really do have
a great sense of humour.

425
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:58,966
Greetings... I'm Ashfaque.
- And I'm the Queen of Jhansi.

426
00:41:40,442 --> 00:41:42,307
Before I raise
this toast to Papa...

427
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:44,612
I want to say something
to all of you.

428
00:41:48,183 --> 00:41:52,085
I had a dream since childhood...
A dream to be like Papa.

429
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,719
To walk like him, speak like
him, sit like him...

430
00:41:56,124 --> 00:41:58,592
To do everything the way he does.

431
00:41:59,794 --> 00:42:02,024
Like the way he is
standing right now...

432
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:09,303
Can't do it.
I know I can't do it.

433
00:42:10,872 --> 00:42:13,841
And maybe I will never be able to
do it because...

434
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,435
there's no one in this world
like my Papa.

435
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:25,716
I know that someone up there is
happy with me to have bestowed on...

436
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,048
me the right to say that
I am Yashvardhan Raichand's son.

437
00:42:31,526 --> 00:42:33,050
Say it proudly.

438
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,351
We just want to say to you that
we love you very much.

439
00:43:17,872 --> 00:43:19,772
I'll just have a look.
Grandmother, you come with me.

440
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:33,044
"Your gilded beauty shines through,
and so do your golden anklets"

441
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:37,941
"They tinkle in melody,
to wound the hearts of millions"

442
00:44:38,586 --> 00:44:40,884
"Your kohled eyes speak
a mysterious language"

443
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:44,055
"the immortal language of love"

444
00:44:45,693 --> 00:44:49,060
Say "shava shava"
friends say "shava shava"

445
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:14,352
"My gilded beauty shines through,
and so do my golden anklets"

446
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:19,149
"They tinkle in melody,
to wound the hearts of millions"

447
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:22,027
"My kohled eyes speak
a mysterious language..."

448
00:45:22,463 --> 00:45:25,023
"the immortal language of love"

449
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:30,434
Say "shava shava"
friends say "shava shava"

450
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:41,033
"Ever since I laid my eyes
on you for the first time..."

451
00:46:41,409 --> 00:46:44,845
"my heart beats faster every minute"

452
00:46:45,213 --> 00:46:50,048
"What have you done to me?
Oh lord, what have you done to me?"

453
00:46:54,522 --> 00:46:59,323
"Your sweet words
make me weak in my knees"

454
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:01,994
"I think I'm falling
in love with you"

455
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,729
"I will die without you"

456
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,999
"Oh God, I will die without you"

457
00:47:11,506 --> 00:47:15,272
Say "shava shava" friends
Say "shava shava"

458
00:48:15,236 --> 00:48:18,603
"May my last breath
be at your feet"

459
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,009
"May my love for you
surpass that of the lord"

460
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,010
"May the lord forgive me,
may the lord forgive me"

461
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:35,484
"You are my heart,
you are my soul"

462
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,018
"You are my heaven,
you are my earth"

463
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,427
"What will I ever do without you"

464
00:48:42,864 --> 00:48:48,029
"Oh lord, what will
I ever do without you"

465
00:49:01,082 --> 00:49:04,643
"Say " shava shava " friends
say "shava shava"

466
00:49:15,363 --> 00:49:19,993
"Your gilded beauty shines through,

467
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:24,802

468
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,808

a mysterious language"

469
00:49:28,142 --> 00:49:31,009
"...the immortal language of love"

470
00:49:32,513 --> 00:49:36,210
"Say " shava shava " friends
say "shava shava"

471
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:39,071
That's enough now.
It's been too much.

472
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:34,057
God... Mad girl...
Come on now...

473
00:51:41,242 --> 00:51:43,472
I'm a dead duck...
I'm a dead duck...

474
00:51:49,517 --> 00:51:50,677
Rukhsar, This one is...

475
00:52:04,832 --> 00:52:06,026
Excuse me Sir!

476
00:52:11,072 --> 00:52:13,336
This is our Anjali.
She has come to apologise to you.

477
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:18,768
Apologise?
Oh... That's not necessary.

478
00:52:19,313 --> 00:52:20,507
Wait! Wait!

479
00:52:21,015 --> 00:52:23,176
How can you say that Sir? She has
caused such a big loss for us...

480
00:52:23,484 --> 00:52:27,443
She must apologise. And to tell you,
she is quite a madcap.

481
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,457
Even in her own house...
- Aunty! Can I speak?

482
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:32,585
Yes... go ahead... apologise.

483
00:52:37,098 --> 00:52:41,296
You know sir,
When I listen to film songs...

484
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:43,529
I tend to get a little filmi.

485
00:52:44,238 --> 00:52:47,207
And that Khandala number
is one of my favourites.

486
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:51,403
Shut up!
- What am I saying?

487
00:52:51,812 --> 00:52:53,780
What did you want to say and
what are you saying?

488
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:57,084
Apologise.

489
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,015
You?
Come on leave right now from here.

490
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:06,759
Me?
- No... no... not you.

491
00:53:09,196 --> 00:53:14,498
Oh! Sir, I was responsible for
smashing your big pot.

492
00:53:14,935 --> 00:53:16,698
Vase.
- Yes, vase... shaz whatever it was.

493
00:53:17,071 --> 00:53:18,834
I'm ready to pay you the
money for it.

494
00:53:19,774 --> 00:53:21,469
By the way how much
was it for?

495
00:53:21,776 --> 00:53:24,643
Now... I don't know...
Sayeeda, Why don't you explain.

496
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,380
Shut up!
- Shut up?

497
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:30,045
This is all because of you.
- Because of me?

498
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:37,046
No... no... not because of you.
God, everything is going wrong.

499
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:40,621
You see sir...

500
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:45,056
Bauji always says that no one becomes
small by asking for forgiveness.

501
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:49,661
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart...

502
00:53:50,171 --> 00:53:53,072
You have a big heart don't you, Sir?
- Now...

503
00:53:54,475 --> 00:53:56,443
So you have forgiven me?
- Yes... I have.

504
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:02,744
Big businesses of big people.
Ok I'll take your leave now.

505
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,746
Please say a big hello to Madam.

506
00:54:06,053 --> 00:54:08,021
May the Lord protect
Greetings. To you too!

507
00:54:27,074 --> 00:54:28,302
Quiet now...

508
00:54:29,076 --> 00:54:34,036
Pot... No, Not a pot... a vase.

509
00:54:34,348 --> 00:54:35,872
Sayeeda... Take her now...

510
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:40,210
Come on now... Come on...
- Not a pot... a vase. Sorry.

511
00:54:48,095 --> 00:54:49,062
A pot!

512
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:52,932
Isn't this that Laddoo's school?

513
00:54:53,234 --> 00:54:55,065
- C'mon lets go and hit him.
- Yes... C'mon.

514
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:11,745
These are the same goons
I was talking about.

515
00:55:24,064 --> 00:55:25,759
Hey, you speak Hindi, don't you?

516
00:55:45,252 --> 00:55:46,514
What? And you didn't do anything?

517
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,779
They were too many of them Didi...
I couldn't do anything.

518
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,458
Here you roam around like a don.
What happened to you there?

519
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,658
Oh! Didi.
- Oh! Didi.

520
00:55:54,962 --> 00:55:56,930
But what was the need for
her to go into the school?

521
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:58,859
Lord Almighty!
What are you saying?

522
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,862
She just entered the school...
not murdered anyone.

523
00:56:02,236 --> 00:56:03,999
What was the need for them
to say all those things?

524
00:56:04,205 --> 00:56:06,173
If I was there I would have caught
each one of them and bashed them up.

525
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:09,339
Yes. They have hurt my sister.

526
00:56:09,777 --> 00:56:11,745
Let me meet that
Laddoo and that Fattoo...

527
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:15,812
I vow on Sachin Tendulkar that
I don't hang them upside down...

528
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,348
in the middle of Chandni Chowk
I won't call myself Bauji's daughter.

529
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:19,553
Anjali!

530
00:56:19,787 --> 00:56:22,585
You don't know, Bauji...
Rich in money but poor at heart...

531
00:56:22,857 --> 00:56:24,290
Can never find place near the Lord...

532
00:56:25,726 --> 00:56:27,591
That's a good line.
Did you write it yourself?

533
00:56:27,862 --> 00:56:28,829
Yes.

534
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:33,767
Greetings to you.
- Greetings.

535
00:56:34,535 --> 00:56:36,765
Anjali, they have come to
our house for the first time...

536
00:56:37,071 --> 00:56:39,039
Get them something to eat.

537
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:41,034
I'm sure they have had
their meals before coming...

538
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:43,039
Haven't you seen the size?

539
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:46,706
Don't worry sir we have eaten.

540
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:49,049
How can you say that? I'll just
get you something in a minute.

541
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:51,480
No. No sir,
Please don't take any trouble.

542
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:54,648
And you also... don't bother.

543
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,586
What's the name?
- Rohan!

544
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:00,190
Not yours, hers...
- Pooja...

545
00:57:00,461 --> 00:57:01,860
You are a real Laddoo. Come on.

546
00:57:07,935 --> 00:57:10,995
You must never hurt
anyone's feelings.

547
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,402
Specially that of a young girl...
and not...

548
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:16,335
when she's so beautiful.
Come on, say Sorry now.

549
00:57:19,346 --> 00:57:21,314
Besides, Someone has told me that...

550
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:24,176
apologising doesn't make
anyone smaller.

551
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:28,017
And the one who forgives
owns a big heart.

552
00:57:30,224 --> 00:57:31,521
Isn't it?

553
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:37,330
What are you looking at?
C'mon, apologise, Laddoo.

554
00:57:51,078 --> 00:57:54,844
If those two can become friends,
why can't we?

555
00:57:55,182 --> 00:57:56,649
Friends?
- Yes...

556
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,375
I just want to be friends with you...
Do you have a problem?

557
00:58:00,087 --> 00:58:03,784
Really?
Friends, ji? C'mon just do it.

558
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,853
I can't see Bauji...
He went to get some food...

559
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:10,460
Bauji is inside...

560
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:21,096
I'm telling you, Rukhsar...
There's something fishy going on.

561
00:58:22,476 --> 00:58:24,171
Anjali, you think he's...
- What?

562
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,513
He is...
- Yes... even I think the same.

563
00:58:28,048 --> 00:58:29,675
Don't you think?
- Correct.

564
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,019
Even you think the same, don't you?
- You are on the mark Rukhsar.

565
00:58:34,855 --> 00:58:37,016
He wants to take away
my shop from me.

566
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:38,358
Oh Allah!

567
00:58:38,659 --> 00:58:41,822
What do I do with this girl?
I'm saying that he might be in...

568
00:58:42,062 --> 00:58:43,620
Iove with you...
- Love?

569
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:46,331
Wow, Rukhsar begum,
you are really great!

570
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:48,728
You think all the girls in Delhi
that he will be in love with me?

571
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:52,539
No one loves me
here in Chandni Chowk...

572
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:55,034
Why would that Yashvardhan's
son be interested in me?

573
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:57,172
Don't joke it away now,
I'm telling you.

574
00:58:57,444 --> 00:58:59,412
Ya ya...
you keep telling...

575
00:59:08,022 --> 00:59:09,785
Take her away.
- What are you saying?

576
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:11,719
It was a joke.
- Stop it.

577
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,993
So you don't want to
buy the sweetmeats?

578
00:59:17,031 --> 00:59:18,726
When did it shift?

579
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:20,627
Red Fort shifted to Agra
a long time ago and...

580
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:22,597
the mental asylum from there
has shifted here.

581
00:59:23,037 --> 00:59:25,665
Not a dime in the pocket and wants to
know the whereabouts of the Red Fort.

582
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:32,071
Bharat Sweet Shop.
Sweets for all occasions...

583
00:59:32,446 --> 00:59:35,006
whether an engagement or wedding.
- Both will happen in due course...

584
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:36,681
what's the hurry?
- Who's that?

585
00:59:36,884 --> 00:59:39,182
Who? It's me, who else?
- Who's me?

586
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,818
What do you mean, who?
It's me your new friend.

587
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:47,494
You know, the children have made
a plan to go to the fair...

588
00:59:48,062 --> 00:59:50,530
I was thinking if you could join us,
it would be great fun!

589
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:51,696
What fair?

590
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:53,867
The fair at Chandni Chowk,
which else?

591
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,763
This fair?
Don't you think...

592
00:59:57,004 --> 00:59:59,234
its importance would reach too high
if you visited this fair?

593
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:02,304
Actually, my importance will increase
manifold, if you could join me.

594
01:00:04,011 --> 01:00:06,036
Tomorrow at 4 in the evening.

595
01:00:06,413 --> 01:00:08,040
Bye.
- Bye Shye.

596
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:21,561
Chandu's uncle fed Chandu's aunty
on a moonlit night in

597
01:00:21,795 --> 01:00:23,763
Chandni Chowk in a silver spoon,
some Chatni. C'mon say it.

598
01:00:24,098 --> 01:00:25,258
Stop it!

599
01:00:28,902 --> 01:00:31,598
Wearing a suit and his boots
Kanhaiyya has arrived to play a band.

600
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,067
Wow! You sing very well.

601
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:37,069
Yes... By the way,
do you always wear such clothes?

602
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:39,876
Yes... When I wear clothes,
I wear these.

603
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:41,911
Otherwise most of the time
I'm in the nude...

604
01:00:42,116 --> 01:00:44,414
No... no... I asked because
we have a proverb that says,

605
01:00:44,818 --> 01:00:46,877
'He who wears a kurta from
Lucknow and Pathani salwar...

606
01:00:47,221 --> 01:00:49,382
stands for a true man and the one
who doesn't, who knows?'

607
01:00:49,723 --> 01:00:52,886
Very good! By the way your hair
looks beautiful when left loose.

608
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:58,292
Isn't it a coincidence that both
our fathers share the same birthday?

609
01:00:58,565 --> 01:01:01,033
Twins?
- Of course. One with a large heart...

610
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:03,236
the other with a large pocket
to pay the bills.

611
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:12,045
Let them be.
They look nice.

612
01:01:16,350 --> 01:01:21,049
Bangles? 'Fair are my wrists...
make me wear those green bangles...'

613
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:24,724
'...Make me yours, my beloved...'

614
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:27,924
You... Sorry, I mean Mr...

615
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:30,460
Ah! Don't be formal...
Say \91you'... makes me feel closer.

616
01:01:31,265 --> 01:01:35,497
Closer? This is getting too much...
Now listen to me Mr. Raichand...

617
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:38,230
- I want to say something to you...
- I'm listening...

618
01:01:39,106 --> 01:01:43,065
What I want to say is that
I can't give you what you want.

619
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:45,803
Why not?
- I just can't.

620
01:01:46,113 --> 01:01:47,637
At least give it a try.

621
01:01:47,915 --> 01:01:49,815
I can't give...
Bauji won't allow it...

622
01:01:50,117 --> 01:01:51,584
I'll ask for it from Bauji...

623
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:54,082
Lord save me! Why would
Bauji give you our shop?

624
01:01:54,454 --> 01:01:57,685
What's the big...? Shop?
What shop?

625
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:01,293
Our Bharat Sweetmeat shop, which else?
- What shop are you talking about?

626
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:04,360
It was alright till friendship but
what is all this intimacy about?

627
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:08,193
You sneaked into my house.
Lord save me, even that is over.

628
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,537
After all there's a limit
to friendship, isn't there?

629
01:02:13,073 --> 01:02:14,040
Shut up!

630
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:18,478
There are many bonds
other than friendship.

631
01:02:19,846 --> 01:02:24,044
Bonds that we don't understand...
that we don't need to understand.

632
01:02:25,819 --> 01:02:27,377
I hope it's not hurting you.

633
01:02:28,522 --> 01:02:32,219
Bonds that are nameless...
that are just to be experienced.

634
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:35,855
I hope it's not hurting you.

635
01:02:36,897 --> 01:02:39,058
Bonds that don't
have any boundaries...

636
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,058
no limits.
I hope it's not hurting you.

637
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:48,074
Bonds that bind the
hearts together...

638
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:52,306
bonds of passion...
bonds of love.

639
01:02:56,116 --> 01:03:01,349
Hurt you? Me too!

640
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:08,027
And one more thing...

641
01:03:08,428 --> 01:03:12,023
I'm definitely going to
take over your sweetmeat shop!

642
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:48,735
"The sun dims into twilight"

643
01:03:49,436 --> 01:03:51,734
"The moon beams simmer brightly"

644
01:04:17,064 --> 01:04:21,023
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

645
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:27,029
"The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

646
01:04:28,342 --> 01:04:33,041
"Is it the call of first love?"

647
01:04:34,548 --> 01:04:40,384
"My love, is it the
call of first love?"

648
01:04:54,101 --> 01:04:59,061
"The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly"

649
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,440
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

650
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:17,019
"The heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

651
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:22,827
"Is it the call of first love?"

652
01:05:23,897 --> 01:05:30,029
"My love, is it the call
of first love?"

653
01:06:12,112 --> 01:06:17,277
"Savour these beauteous moments,
when everything changes"

654
01:06:17,617 --> 01:06:22,350
"Our dreams blend into
the realms of reality"

655
01:06:24,057 --> 01:06:29,427
"I wonder if our love,
travelling through centuries..."

656
01:06:29,996 --> 01:06:35,024
"has bound us in its silken threads"

657
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:41,430
"Let this season of love
remain eternal"

658
01:06:42,209 --> 01:06:47,511
"let us meet through lives
and lives, like today"

659
01:06:48,882 --> 01:06:52,443
"I stand still as the earth
moves around me"

660
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:59,053
"the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

661
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:04,995
"Is it the call of first love?"

662
01:07:05,899 --> 01:07:12,395
"My love, is it the call
of first love?"

663
01:07:56,082 --> 01:08:02,988
"The colours of our souls
has melted into one"

664
01:08:05,025 --> 01:08:11,988
"I can't say which of me is you
and which of you is me"

665
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:20,997
"O beloved, it's the waves
of the your love that drown me"

666
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:27,002
"before transporting me to the shore"

667
01:08:29,049 --> 01:08:34,009
"It's the thirst of the ocean,
It's the dream of the night"

668
01:08:34,988 --> 01:08:40,016
"The hearts of the flames
have been set afire"

669
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:46,321
"I stand still
as the earth moves around me"

670
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:52,028
"the heart beats faster
as my breath goes deeper"

671
01:08:53,406 --> 01:08:57,365
"My love, is it the
call of first love?"

672
01:08:58,612 --> 01:09:04,983
"My love, is it
the call of first love?"

673
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:11,655
"The sun dims into twilight,
moon beams simmer brightly"

674
01:10:18,091 --> 01:10:20,855
She's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely mad.

675
01:10:21,795 --> 01:10:25,060
She makes strange faces,
she talks a lot.

676
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:29,068
And she has some lovable mannerisms.

677
01:10:30,103 --> 01:10:33,072
And wherever she goes
she breaks a vase a pot

678
01:10:33,506 --> 01:10:35,474
Pot?
- That's what she calls them.

679
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,403
But whenever I'm next to her,
I don't know what happens to me.

680
01:10:42,849 --> 01:10:45,818
But she's slightly mad.
Actually she's completely...

681
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,076
Mad.

682
01:10:50,123 --> 01:10:51,886
What's the name
of this mad hatter?

683
01:10:56,129 --> 01:10:57,596
I wanted to know your opinion.

684
01:10:57,797 --> 01:11:01,233
I'm very happy with this alliance.
Naina is a very nice girl.

685
01:11:01,801 --> 01:11:03,598
Have you spoken to Rahul
about this?

686
01:11:03,803 --> 01:11:06,772
What's the need to speak to Rahul?
He can't take these family decisions.

687
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,040
Naina will be the daughter-in-law
of this house... our house!

688
01:11:16,149 --> 01:11:18,447
DJ... Who will do all
this for me there?

689
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:42,074
Dad, Why can't I stay with
all of you here?

690
01:11:43,176 --> 01:11:45,406
Why are you sending me
to the boarding school?

691
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:48,881
Traditions, my child...
traditions...

692
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:52,544
Your grandfather went there,
I did, so did bhaiyya.

693
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,354
You can't break the traditions
of the house, can you?

694
01:11:55,555 --> 01:11:56,522
No...

695
01:12:09,068 --> 01:12:11,036
Always remember
one more thing...

696
01:12:11,671 --> 01:12:13,298
Mom loves me more than
she loves you.

697
01:12:34,994 --> 01:12:37,724
You have given me so much already...
I can't take all these.

698
01:12:37,997 --> 01:12:41,728
Sayeeda... If Rahul and Rohan
can be like your sons...

699
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:44,069
then don't have a right
over your daughter?

700
01:12:44,404 --> 01:12:46,872
Of course you have...
But all this is too much...

701
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:50,843
Just tell me what time
is the actual wedding?

702
01:12:53,847 --> 01:12:55,815
Rohan... listen to me carefully.

703
01:12:59,285 --> 01:13:00,809
Take care of your food and sleep.

704
01:13:01,287 --> 01:13:03,016
Rohan, he has reached
his school.

705
01:13:03,723 --> 01:13:05,691
Hey! What's all this?

706
01:13:06,392 --> 01:13:08,360
Tomorrow is Rukhsar's wedding...
So the two of us...

707
01:13:08,728 --> 01:13:10,889
Congratulations to you Sayeeda!

708
01:13:11,197 --> 01:13:13,757
If you need anything just ask for it
- Thank you sir...

709
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:16,194
I'd be very happy if you and bhabhiji
could attend the wedding tomorrow...

710
01:13:16,402 --> 01:13:18,700
I have asked Rahul to attend the
wedding, he will be there.

711
01:13:21,441 --> 01:13:22,408
Ok.

712
01:13:27,347 --> 01:13:29,042
Rahul baba must have come now...

713
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:31,046
Let me just check.
I'll just be back.

714
01:13:43,463 --> 01:13:45,055
Listen to me.

715
01:13:48,101 --> 01:13:49,864
Tomorrow is a big day for Sayeeda.

716
01:13:50,203 --> 01:13:54,162
I think we should go too...
- How can we go there, Nandini?

717
01:13:55,174 --> 01:14:00,077
I can understand... But still we...
- We cannot go there.

718
01:14:01,848 --> 01:14:06,410
Please think about it again...
- I said it, didn't I? That's it!

719
01:14:41,421 --> 01:14:43,389
Eh! What happened to Chandni?

720
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:48,560
Haldiram, What happened?
- What happened?

721
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:11,346
Listen... let me say a couplet.

722
01:15:12,652 --> 01:15:15,177
'Kurta from Lucknow or a pathani salwar
does not make a man...

723
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:17,685
He who gives away his
heart stands for a true man...

724
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:19,687
and the one who doesn't...
who knows?'

725
01:15:33,072 --> 01:15:34,767
"Oh the brides decorated hands"

726
01:15:35,475 --> 01:15:37,204
"Oh the brides bejewelled finery"

727
01:15:37,810 --> 01:15:40,540
"Oh she looks like a floral ornament"

728
01:15:42,348 --> 01:15:44,043
"Oh the brides kohled eyes"

729
01:15:44,817 --> 01:15:46,375
"Oh she looks the
most beautiful of them all"

730
01:16:09,275 --> 01:16:11,402
"Oh the bridesmaid..."

731
01:16:11,711 --> 01:16:13,679
"She looks like a silken thread"

732
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:20,345
"she peeps from behind,
and steals a glance"

733
01:16:32,598 --> 01:16:36,762
"Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart"

734
01:16:37,203 --> 01:16:39,034
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

735
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:54,416
"These lanes of my childhood,
I shall never depart"

736
01:16:55,688 --> 01:16:59,055
"Put some sense,
into this crazy man's head"

737
01:17:09,535 --> 01:17:13,437
"He is hurling himself onto me"

738
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,001
"Oh lord, this young man oh my lord"

739
01:17:46,072 --> 01:17:48,040
"Whether thy lips speak or not..."

740
01:17:48,407 --> 01:17:50,375
"your eyes divulge the story"

741
01:17:51,077 --> 01:17:55,036
"You can't hide love in disdain..."

742
01:17:55,815 --> 01:17:59,216
"you can't hide love in disdain..."

743
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:04,147
"A veiled silence speaks
more than a thousand words"

744
01:18:05,024 --> 01:18:08,983
"Words don't always
do justice, my friend"

745
01:18:09,428 --> 01:18:11,726
"What's in the heart,
only the heart knows"

746
01:18:11,964 --> 01:18:13,488
"Or then the lord"

747
01:18:13,833 --> 01:18:17,462
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

748
01:18:18,738 --> 01:18:22,367
"Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord"

749
01:18:57,877 --> 01:19:02,177
"You can't demand,
a hand in betrothal"

750
01:19:02,915 --> 01:19:06,976
"pairs are ordained,
already in heaven"

751
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:10,981
"Pairs are ordained,
already in heaven"

752
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:15,991
"Leading a wedding procession,
I will take you from your doorstep"

753
01:19:16,729 --> 01:19:20,995
"It's been destined so,
"Oh go away and stop day dreaming"

754
01:19:25,638 --> 01:19:29,301
"Oh my lord,
this young man, oh my lord"

755
01:19:35,114 --> 01:19:38,515
"Oh the bridesmaid...
she looks like a silken thread"

756
01:19:39,452 --> 01:19:43,411
"She peeps from behind,
and steals a glance"

757
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:57,631
"Whether she admits it or nay,
she's stolen my heart"

758
01:20:00,339 --> 01:20:04,036
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

759
01:20:04,944 --> 01:20:08,778
"Oh lord,
this young man oh my lord"

760
01:20:09,415 --> 01:20:13,044
"Oh lord, this damsel oh my lord"

761
01:20:15,988 --> 01:20:17,216
Agreed!

762
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:21,326
Agreed!

763
01:20:40,346 --> 01:20:42,871
Agreed!
- Even I agree.

764
01:20:47,687 --> 01:20:50,349
You love her don't you?
- Yes, Papa.

765
01:20:51,457 --> 01:20:53,084
Didn't I tell you, Nandini?
What did I tell you?

766
01:20:56,128 --> 01:20:58,096
I'm very happy,
today Rahul... very happy.

767
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:00,832
Just promise me that
you will keep her happy too.

768
01:21:01,167 --> 01:21:01,895
You will keep my daughter-in-law
very happy.

769
01:21:03,135 --> 01:21:05,035
You will keep Naina very happy.

770
01:21:29,095 --> 01:21:31,063
You face has fallen as
if we are already married.

771
01:21:32,465 --> 01:21:34,763
By the way this expression appears
only after a man gets married.

772
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:41,071
Eh Rahul, What's the matter?

773
01:21:43,109 --> 01:21:44,804
What's her name?

774
01:21:45,478 --> 01:21:46,638
Naina!

775
01:21:48,013 --> 01:21:50,811
I wish that was the name.
But it isn't.

776
01:21:55,454 --> 01:21:57,081
Naina... it's just...
- Rahul!

777
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:02,026
Ever since I can remember
I have loved you...

778
01:22:02,395 --> 01:22:07,025
Loved you very much.
But it isn't your fault.

779
01:22:09,068 --> 01:22:13,937
Just because I dreamt of marrying you
doesn't mean you have to marry me.

780
01:22:15,241 --> 01:22:18,836
And if you are worried
that I will miserable...

781
01:22:19,278 --> 01:22:20,836
yes I will be.

782
01:22:21,147 --> 01:22:22,808
I will feel very bad...
it will hurt

783
01:22:23,082 --> 01:22:27,041
a lot too.
But life doesn't stop, does it Rahul?

784
01:22:29,455 --> 01:22:33,050
Perhaps a few years from now
I can laugh at the fact that...

785
01:22:33,826 --> 01:22:37,785
I loved a certain Rahul
who could not become mine.

786
01:22:39,098 --> 01:22:44,730
Because he was never mine!
And my love story remained incomplete.

787
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:51,070
But do me a favour Rahul.

788
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,081
Please complete your love story.

789
01:22:58,184 --> 01:23:00,675
You will, won't you Rahul?
For my sake.

790
01:23:05,057 --> 01:23:09,016
Now say something quickly
before I cry more.

791
01:23:11,063 --> 01:23:12,360
Even me.

792
01:23:34,753 --> 01:23:36,050
Raichand.

793
01:23:40,226 --> 01:23:44,322
The name and the respect has been
given to us by our ancestors.

794
01:23:47,099 --> 01:23:52,401
To honour and respect
them is our foremost duty.

795
01:23:54,974 --> 01:24:00,742
And I will never tolerate
an ordinary girl becoming a hurdle...

796
01:24:01,046 --> 01:24:03,014
in performing that duty.

797
01:24:06,318 --> 01:24:08,809
You didn't even think once...

798
01:24:10,656 --> 01:24:16,424
about the background of the girl,
her status... her breeding.

799
01:24:18,998 --> 01:24:21,831
You didn't give a thought to whether
the girl will be able to understand...

800
01:24:22,067 --> 01:24:23,694
our culture... our traditions.

801
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:27,863
Will the girl ever understand
our rituals... our rites?

802
01:24:29,708 --> 01:24:31,835
Will the girl understand our
ethics and principles?

803
01:24:33,812 --> 01:24:35,712
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

804
01:24:35,948 --> 01:24:37,040
Will she...?

805
01:24:39,451 --> 01:24:43,410
How did you even dare to think
that she can be a part of our family?

806
01:24:45,424 --> 01:24:48,291
That she can be a
part of my family?

807
01:24:51,263 --> 01:24:53,060
How did you think?

808
01:24:56,669 --> 01:25:01,003
Where did I think, Papa?
I didn't think at all.

809
01:25:04,043 --> 01:25:09,345
I just loved... love.

810
01:25:11,116 --> 01:25:12,276
Love?

811
01:25:20,059 --> 01:25:24,359
It's such a pity that. I made
a mistake in knowing my own son

812
01:25:28,067 --> 01:25:30,035
I thought he knew me.

813
01:25:32,671 --> 01:25:34,639
That he understands
the traditions of this family.

814
01:25:35,074 --> 01:25:37,770
He understands my emotions...
he understands every breath of mine.

815
01:25:43,082 --> 01:25:48,714
I was so wrong... so wrong.

816
01:25:55,828 --> 01:25:57,796
I was really proud of you.

817
01:25:58,430 --> 01:26:00,990
You were my self-respect.
You were my strength.

818
01:26:05,604 --> 01:26:12,009
You have taken all that away
from me... everything.

819
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,208
You have hurt me,

820
01:26:24,056 --> 01:26:25,819
You have hurt me.

821
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,058
I never wanted to hurt you.

822
01:27:03,362 --> 01:27:05,330
I only wanted to bring you happiness.

823
01:27:08,033 --> 01:27:10,001
What have I done?

824
01:27:13,706 --> 01:27:15,674
How could I bring tears to your eyes?

825
01:27:17,843 --> 01:27:19,674
How could I bring tears?

826
01:27:22,715 --> 01:27:24,546
Don't ever forgive me.

827
01:27:27,386 --> 01:27:29,820
Please don't say that
I have hurt you.

828
01:27:31,957 --> 01:27:33,754
Don't forgive me.

829
01:27:36,061 --> 01:27:38,689
I will do as you say
just as you say.

830
01:28:28,413 --> 01:28:30,005
Bauji... Bauji...

831
01:28:30,382 --> 01:28:33,351
Please don't leave us and go.

832
01:28:35,053 --> 01:28:37,453
Get up Bauji...
Don't leave us, Bauji...

833
01:29:13,692 --> 01:29:15,660
Will the girl be able to understand
our culture, our traditions.

834
01:29:16,495 --> 01:29:18,554
Will the girl ever understand our
rituals... our rites?

835
01:29:18,831 --> 01:29:20,992
Will the girl understand
our ethics and principles?

836
01:29:21,366 --> 01:29:23,334
Will she adhere to
the values of our family?

837
01:31:02,067 --> 01:31:03,432
Today...

838
01:31:10,075 --> 01:31:15,536
today you have proved that
you are not my blood.

839
01:31:31,496 --> 01:31:33,464
You are not my blood.

840
01:31:39,271 --> 01:31:49,078
You have proved that
you are not mine.

841
01:31:52,918 --> 01:31:53,885
Papa!

842
01:31:56,188 --> 01:31:58,315
You have lost the right
to call me that!

843
01:32:06,064 --> 01:32:13,766
Made me a stranger in a moment.
Made me a stranger in just a moment.

844
01:32:46,438 --> 01:32:48,736
Does that mean I have no
place in this house anymore?

845
01:33:46,431 --> 01:33:48,399
I am right... am I not, mother?

846
01:33:56,108 --> 01:33:58,076
I'm right, am I not?

847
01:34:04,049 --> 01:34:10,477
Then let me go... Can I go?

848
01:34:17,062 --> 01:34:19,758
"Through smiles or through tears"

849
01:34:20,732 --> 01:34:27,365
"We shall never part,
through smiles nor through tears"

850
01:35:04,843 --> 01:35:10,008
"My blessings live with you..."

851
01:35:10,749 --> 01:35:16,016
"to protect you from evil eyes"

852
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:22,022
"My wishes for you..."

853
01:35:23,361 --> 01:35:26,330
"wherever you go"

854
01:35:29,067 --> 01:35:34,369
"May happiness and joy,
kiss your feet forever"

855
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,768
"It's all your blessings"

856
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:43,712
"Whether smiles or tears,
we shall never part"

857
01:35:44,349 --> 01:35:47,716
"through smiles or through tears"

858
01:36:17,716 --> 01:36:25,020
Promise me that you will never let
tears come to his eyes... promise me.

859
01:36:39,404 --> 01:36:40,701
Now go!

860
01:36:45,443 --> 01:36:47,035
Rahul... we didn't take
blessings from father.

861
01:36:48,413 --> 01:36:53,043
We don't have father's blessings...
Rahul we didn't...

862
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:17,003
Go Sayeeda.
Go with my son.

863
01:37:18,476 --> 01:37:20,000
Wherever he goes...

864
01:37:22,047 --> 01:37:24,777
I don't want him to miss the warmth
of a mother's affection.

865
01:37:26,484 --> 01:37:29,612
If you want to be someone in life...
if you want to achieve something...

866
01:37:30,055 --> 01:37:33,024
if you want to win,
always listen to your heart.

867
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:38,027
And if even that doesn't
give you any answers...

868
01:37:38,396 --> 01:37:43,026
close your eyes and
think of your parents.

869
01:37:44,803 --> 01:37:51,641
And then you will cross all the hurdles
all your problems will vanish.

870
01:37:53,078 --> 01:37:55,546
Victory will be yours.
Only yours.

871
01:37:59,084 --> 01:38:00,984
You will remember all this,
won't you Rohan?

872
01:38:01,419 --> 01:38:06,186
Why are you going, Bhaiyya?
Why? Please don't go.

873
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:14,657
Promise me Rohan that after today
you will never ask anyone...

874
01:38:15,033 --> 01:38:17,399
why I left and where I went...
promise me.

875
01:38:28,680 --> 01:38:30,341
Take care of mother.

876
01:38:34,052 --> 01:38:36,020
Get selected in the cricket team.

877
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:56,774
And thus Yash's ego and
Rahul's stubborn stand broke...

878
01:38:57,809 --> 01:39:02,439
the family into two...
broke the family into two...

879
01:40:45,149 --> 01:40:49,085
I will bring you back Bhaiyya.
I will bring you home Bhabhi.

880
01:40:50,121 --> 01:40:52,589
To your home... our home.

881
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:18,478
Nandini...
- Yes?

882
01:41:22,253 --> 01:41:24,551
You have forgotten me
as soon as your son has arrived.

883
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:53,576
Where is Rohan?

884
01:41:54,419 --> 01:41:56,387
I don't know where he
left early this morning.

885
01:41:56,554 --> 01:41:59,853
Greetings for Id.
- Greetings for Id.

886
01:42:00,224 --> 01:42:03,591
Greetings to you too.
Wow... you are glowing.

887
01:42:03,962 --> 01:42:05,862
I feel so happy that you have come.
Greetings for Id.

888
01:42:06,230 --> 01:42:08,858
God! How big he has grown.
- Yes... Both have grown quite a lot.

889
01:42:09,233 --> 01:42:10,700
Stop it now...
- Just a joke.

890
01:42:11,035 --> 01:42:12,832
What's his name, Haldiram?
- Ghasitaram!

891
01:42:13,171 --> 01:42:18,473
Hello! Salutations.
Greetings for Id.

892
01:42:18,843 --> 01:42:21,141
Greetings to you too.
- Recognise me?

893
01:42:24,315 --> 01:42:27,478
Well...
- I'm from... there.

894
01:42:27,885 --> 01:42:29,318
Ok... yes yes.

895
01:42:29,654 --> 01:42:32,384
He's just spinning yarns. He's just
come to have some free drinks.

896
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:38,554
I don't seem to see your mother.
- That reminds me...

897
01:42:38,930 --> 01:42:40,955
What's the news about Anjali?
- They are all very well.

898
01:42:41,332 --> 01:42:44,165
I just spoke to them in the morning.
- Please give them lots of our love.

899
01:42:44,535 --> 01:42:47,971
Rukhsar!
- You all chat... I\92ll be back.

900
01:42:49,407 --> 01:42:53,969
What a life Anjali is leading!
From Chandni Chowk to...

901
01:42:54,879 --> 01:42:57,848
Yes. From Chandni Chowk to...?
- To...

902
01:42:58,216 --> 01:42:59,877
To... where?
- What where? Chandni Chowk?

903
01:43:00,218 --> 01:43:02,186
That's in Delhi.
- You said she went somewhere.

904
01:43:02,553 --> 01:43:05,954
Where did she go?
- Brother... Where she went?

905
01:43:06,357 --> 01:43:09,986
Where did she go?
- Where did she go? Where she went...

906
01:43:10,662 --> 01:43:12,459
Where did she go?
- Where did she go?

907
01:43:12,864 --> 01:43:15,128
Where- did- they- go?
- Where-did-they-go?

908
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,934
Didn't you say they went somewhere?
Probably America or somewhere...

909
01:43:18,302 --> 01:43:20,793
Oh! Have they gone to America?

910
01:43:21,906 --> 01:43:24,466
But they didn't live there earlier.
- Exactly.

911
01:43:24,909 --> 01:43:26,638
Where did they live earlier?
- In Chandni Chowk.

912
01:43:26,978 --> 01:43:29,640
After that... Where?
- America... Didn't you just say?

913
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,948
And in between?
- In between whom?

914
01:43:32,327 --> 01:43:34,158
In between the two...
- What is between the two?

915
01:43:34,530 --> 01:43:36,964
What is between the two?
- The place between the two...

916
01:43:37,332 --> 01:43:39,300
What's the place between the two?
What is he talking about?

917
01:43:39,668 --> 01:43:42,831
Wonder where these people come from.
- I'm trying to tell you, the place...

918
01:43:43,205 --> 01:43:45,332
What place are you talking about?
- What place? Where?

919
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:47,403
Silence! Come here.

920
01:43:50,212 --> 01:43:51,839
Haldiram has lost his marbles.

921
01:43:52,214 --> 01:43:55,183
She has gone to London.
Someday even I will go there.

922
01:44:07,229 --> 01:44:08,992
You have just come back, son.
And you want to go away again?

923
01:44:09,231 --> 01:44:10,789
I feel incomplete here, Dad!

924
01:44:11,166 --> 01:44:15,125
Why don't you study for MBA here?
There are a lot of universities here.

925
01:44:16,171 --> 01:44:20,130
Why do you want to go to London?
- Traditions, Dad... Traditions.

926
01:44:22,177 --> 01:44:24,805
Grandfather went there, you did...

927
01:44:26,181 --> 01:44:30,413
So did Bhaiyya... So how can I break
the traditions of this house?
