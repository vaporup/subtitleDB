1
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,570
"Siegfried dealt the king a mortal blow.

2
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,140
"The sword drew blood from the wounds
and King Lindegast was saddened.

3
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,090
"He begged Siegfried to let him live
and offered him his lance."

4
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,560
Bastian?

5
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,170
God!

6
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,660
Bastian!

7
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,740
Hi, Dad.

8
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,620
Out of the pool, kids.

9
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,350
Stop horsing around.

10
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,020
Everybody, line up!

11
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,270
- Who wants to make the team?
- Me!

12
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,970
Good. Let's see who's got what it takes.

13
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,910
We're going to start with the high board.

14
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,080
Billy, go!

15
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,050
Bastian...

16
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,820
...you're next.

17
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,990
Go!

18
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,400
Bastian, go for it!

19
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,970
You can do it!

20
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,010
What's the matter?

21
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,150
I got a cramp.

22
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,020
High wimp factor.

23
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,860
Sorry, coach.

24
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,570
How did it go?

25
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,940
Did you make the swim team?

26
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,950
No.

27
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,410
What happened?

28
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,550
I didn't jump.

29
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,350
Why not?

30
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,160
I guess I...

31
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,560
...had a cramp.

32
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,740
Going out tonight?

33
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,780
Yeah. Technical sales staff seminar.

34
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,250
Is Ms. Station Wagon picking you up?

35
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,740
Why do you say that?

36
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
The tie.

37
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,590
Yeah.

38
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,130
Dressing is common courtesy, Bastian.

39
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,290
Something you must learn.
Look at that rag you're wearing.

40
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,400
- I like it.
- Well, I don't.

41
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,140
Mom made it!

42
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,680
You don't remember, do you?

43
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,590
I've gotta go.

44
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,670
Mr. Koreander?

45
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,540
Well, it's been a while.

46
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,190
- I dropped in to say hi.
- Hi.

47
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,560
Do you carry "How-to" books?

48
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,100
"How-to" books?

49
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,140
Does this place look like a supermarket?

50
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,360
If you want advice on buying real estate...

51
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,070
...or housebreaking your goldfish...

52
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,710
...go to the video store down the street.

53
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,210
What is it you want to know?

54
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,180
Something about heights.

55
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,020
How to be able to jump from a high...

56
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,190
...a very high...

57
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
...an extremely high diving board.

58
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,530
I'll look in my section on...

59
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,430
...courage.

60
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,120
Bastian.

61
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,650
We need your help.

62
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,420
Help us.

63
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,930
Please come back, Bastian.

64
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,840
"The Neverending Story."

65
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,130
Put it back!

66
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,500
That book asks too much of you.

67
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,000
But it's The Neverending Story.
I've already read it.

68
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,470
But have you ever read a book twice?

69
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,800
Books change each time you read them.

70
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,600
- Give it back.
- I really want to read it again.

71
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,270
No, no. Look what I found for you.

72
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,970
Let me borrow it, please!

73
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,380
No, Bastian!

74
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,440
Auryn.

75
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,770
Bastian.

76
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,940
We need your help.

77
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,440
Come back to Fantasia.

78
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,770
We are in great danger.

79
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,170
Fantasia!

80
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,300
An Earthling to save the Childlike Empress!

81
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,860
Nimbly!

82
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,780
Enter, my spy.

83
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,070
Mistress of Horok Castle,
I came as fast as I...

84
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,270
- You were saying?
- I could gain the boy's confidence.

85
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,300
I don't care about his confidence.
I want his wishes.

86
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,310
Tri Face!

87
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,960
The Memory Machine.
Explain it to him, Tri Face.

88
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,060
Yes, explain it!

89
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,100
Every time the Earthling
uses Auryn to make a wish...

90
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,730
...my new invention
makes him lose a memory!

91
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,800
With each wish,
the liquid in his head forms a memory ball.

92
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,810
It falls down and is collected...

93
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,370
...in the beaker below.

94
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,380
What happens when he has lost
all of his memories?

95
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,680
Obviously, the beaker at the bottom is full.

96
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,150
And the Earthling's head is empty.

97
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,220
He won't remember where he came from.

98
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,290
He won't remember his own world.

99
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,930
But best of all,
he will have forgotten his mission:

100
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,560
Why he came to Fantasia.

101
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,200
He will forget the Childlike Empress.

102
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,140
That's when I'll bring order to the chaos
they call dreams and stories.

103
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,780
Nimbly, go!

104
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,950
Make the Earthling wish.

105
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,090
Are you okay?

106
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,280
Fine. I'm fine.

107
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,290
My best landing yet.

108
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,920
Looks like you just got your wings.

109
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,830
No, I've always had them.

110
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,690
I'm Bastian.

111
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,240
Nimbly's the name, tour guide's the game!

112
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,180
Let me show you the sights of Silver City!

113
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,080
Watch out!

114
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,110
Pure acid!

115
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,960
Acid?

116
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,660
Fantasians will be grateful
if you wish for the lake to be filled...

117
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,000
...with crystal spring water instead.

118
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,870
What do you mean, if I would wish?

119
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,710
You have Auryn.

120
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,300
It fulfills all of your wishes.

121
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,840
Too bad only one of these exists.

122
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,390
You want something. You wish it.

123
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,050
Auryn makes it happen.

124
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,950
You're very lucky.

125
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,350
Come on! Try it out.

126
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,360
Start with the lake. Make it purple.

127
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,400
Add some sugar.

128
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,360
Raise the temperature
so we can go swimming.

129
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:24,370
I don't know.
I'm sure there's a reason for the acid.

130
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:27,630
Maybe it keeps everything shiny.

131
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,810
I wouldn't want to change anything,
it's so pretty.

132
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,210
Come on, make a wish.

133
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,790
Look!

134
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,630
Come on.

135
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,130
Everything seems fine in Fantasia.

136
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,040
Fine and dandy.

137
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,810
Why do you ask?

138
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,510
I have to see the Childlike Empress.

139
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,480
How far is it to the Ivory Tower?

140
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,110
You mean, how many ways to get there?

141
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,340
No, I mean in distance.

142
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,520
Yards?

143
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,780
Miles?

144
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,450
Kilometers?

145
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,020
Everything's as close or as far...

146
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,860
...as you want it to be.

147
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,910
Nimbly?

148
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,260
- What are they?
- I didn't have time to ask.

149
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,630
- They look like giants.
- I can see that!

150
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,640
Come back.

151
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,680
Wish for our lives!

152
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,690
Acid!

153
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,770
Hey, silly boy!

154
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,810
Wish them away, for Fantasia's sake!

155
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,710
Wish them away, Bastian!

156
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,720
Nimbly!

157
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,700
Kids! Just wish!

158
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,050
Wish to be safe!

159
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,500
Well done, Bastian!

160
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm safe.

161
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,970
You can get out of here.

162
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,740
I made it.

163
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,180
Where'd you go?

164
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,520
Look here. Who is this?

165
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,590
Nice entrance.

166
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,150
It's an Earthling.

167
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,720
Yes, it is an Earthling.

168
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,500
You just taught some Giants
how to swim, Earthling.

169
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,050
Hi.

170
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,020
Hello.

171
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,550
I didn't mean to interrupt anything.

172
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:11,420
You have come to the Ship of Secret Plots.

173
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,990
"You were called by the Childlike Empress"

174
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,530
Is she all right?

175
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,430
In my world, the Empress is now only...

176
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,760
...an empty page.

177
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,670
We haven't been able to reach her
for a long time.

178
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,740
Those who dared the journey
to the Ivory Tower perished.

179
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:31,210
The very earth is breaking away.

180
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,910
Even us Mudwarts who are made of earth,
can't get there.

181
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,120
"Take courage, friends

182
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,180
"The Earthling has come to help us
We must talk to the Empress"

183
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,210
Childlike Empress.

184
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,770
Bastian, you are the only Earthling
moved by our plight.

185
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,640
What's going on?

186
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,070
Are you hurt?

187
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,550
The same force that makes the books
in your world become empty...

188
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,810
...makes me a prisoner in my castle.

189
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,420
What is this force?

190
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,820
Only you can name it, Bastian.

191
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,220
Name it?

192
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,690
We are the creatures of human fantasies.

193
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,430
We need your dreams and stories to exist.

194
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,660
But the people in your world
no longer believe in us.

195
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,760
They have no time
to give us names and stories.

196
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,070
Tell me what I must do!

197
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,700
There is...

198
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,170
You must resist...

199
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,540
Your answer... Auryn will help you.

200
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,140
But you must remember if you use it...

201
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,980
Only you can save us, Bastian.

202
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,210
Only you can heal both
of our worlds. Bastian!

203
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,580
You are my last hope.

204
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,370
We must get everyone in Fantasia
to help us.

205
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,510
Now!

206
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:16,770
Bastian.

207
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,910
K. Koreander - Antique Bookstore

208
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,390
The Empress is being held prisoner.

209
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,000
Before we can fight the force holding her...

210
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,940
...I must give it a name.

211
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,080
Who will join me on my quest?

212
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,510
You saw the Giants, they're everywhere.

213
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,180
You can't hide.

214
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,340
There will be more Giants
who will destroy your beautiful ships!

215
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,050
I'm afraid.

216
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,290
If you give up...

217
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,280
...it's not only the end of Silver City...

218
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,190
...it's the end of Fantasia.

219
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,120
Do you know what that means?

220
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,260
The children of my world
will have no more stories to read.

221
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:37,300
Ever.

222
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,460
Is there no one with the courage
to stand up with me against the Giants?

223
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,410
Atreyu!

224
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,540
Atreyu!

225
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,310
Bastian!

226
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,460
Welcome back.

227
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,520
How did you...

228
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,090
In my dreams I saw a light over Silver City
and I knew there was hope.

229
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,330
But I did not expect to find you.

230
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,840
Were you in danger?

231
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,300
- Did you see the Giants?
- Where do they come from?

232
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,900
People talk about a castle
shaped like a hand.

233
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,030
Some say that's where
the Giants come from.

234
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,480
That's where we should go.

235
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,040
There are burning arrows of light
all around it.

236
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,580
Do you know of a castle
that looks like a hand?

237
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,380
You mean Horok Castle, the Seeing Hand?
Sure!

238
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,160
Do you know how to get there?

239
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,660
There are no roads. You'll have to fly.

240
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,660
But a little wish would go a long way.

241
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,700
A wish?

242
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,660
Nimbly's right. I have Auryn.

243
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,270
- I should use it.
- When I'm right, I'm right.

244
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,600
I'll try it.

245
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,630
I need something...

246
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,340
...something that...

247
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,680
...can fly...

248
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,750
...and that can scare the pants off
anything living in that castle.

249
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,660
Very sensible.

250
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,250
I'll wish for the most horrible flying dragon
in the history of Fantasia!

251
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,100
I wish him to be red. No, green.

252
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:21,040
I wish him to fly as fast as the Concorde
and stinks so bad...

253
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,630
...that he makes you sick!

254
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,640
And breathes fire.

255
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,410
I'll call him Smerg.

256
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:34,440
Maybe you should wish
for some modifications.

257
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,210
Oh, no!

258
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,520
Oh, yes!

259
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:56,100
We can't let it loose on Fantasia.
Who knows what it might do.

260
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,840
- What are you going to do?
- Chase it!

261
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,600
Chase?

262
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,880
Did somebody say "chase"?

263
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,070
Falkor!

264
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,140
Boy, am I glad to see you!

265
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,990
And I'm glad to see you.

266
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,920
What are we waiting for?

267
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,990
I've got an itch behind my ear.

268
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,050
Go for it, Falkor!

269
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,980
Look! The castle that looks like a hand.

270
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,250
A very mean hand.

271
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,880
Hold on.

272
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:05,900
Smerg got zapped.

273
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,730
We got to find Atreyu.

274
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,130
I got to get some rest.

275
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,170
Hey!

276
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:17,910
Watch it, folks!

277
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,170
Rockbiter!

278
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,790
Rockbiter!

279
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,160
You'll wake him up.

280
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,610
Meet Junior.

281
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:55,350
Is this yum-yum rockie?

282
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,820
Let me try.

283
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,610
Junior...

284
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:35,620
...when are you going to learn...

285
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,130
...the difference between a rock...

286
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,260
...and a nose?

287
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,330
Why was Junior crying?

288
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,000
He's hungry.

289
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,500
Hungry?

290
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,410
With all these rocks around?

291
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:59,210
I don't understand it...

292
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,210
...myself...

293
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,750
...but all...

294
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:08,920
...goodness has gone out of the rocks.

295
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,320
They're hollow.

296
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:14,390
Whole mountains...

297
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,900
...have turned empty.

298
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,030
There's nothing left...

299
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,970
...to nourish us.

300
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,500
It's all part of the same thing.

301
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:41,350
You're fighting a losing battle,
Childlike Empress.

302
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,160
Soon your slick little castle...

303
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,250
...will be as dark as mine.

304
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:27,170
I didn't break the window!

305
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,630
Don't lie to me!

306
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:34,070
You promised to take me swimming.
You promised.

307
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,540
Something's come up.

308
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,140
I hate you! I hate you!

309
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,280
So that's what humans remember.

310
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,090
That's a memory Bastian has lost!

311
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,370
Excuse me.

312
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,980
What can I do for you?

313
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,990
Do you know Bastian? Bastian Bux?

314
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,290
Do we ever really know anybody?

315
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,460
I'm Bastian's father. Barney.

316
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,830
I found this book in my son's room.

317
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,800
Your address is inside the cover.

318
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,270
Really?

319
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,540
Where?

320
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,910
I don't understand.

321
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,140
I saw it there last night.

322
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,850
Look, I'm an engineer.

323
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,060
What I see is what I see when I see it.

324
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,090
It's an interesting concept.

325
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,590
My son's missing since last night.

326
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,870
Heavy reading for a young man.

327
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,070
When did you last see him?

328
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,710
Maybe you'll find the explanation
for his disappearance...

329
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:19,540
...inside.

330
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,040
We were getting worried about you.

331
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,440
Where have you been?

332
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,710
I convinced some warriors
to help us take the castle.

333
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,580
Warriors?

334
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,990
Where are they?

335
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,660
Right here.

336
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,490
Atreyu, get real!

337
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,600
But I am real!

338
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,040
What do you mean, "get real"?

339
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,130
Forget it. It's a joke.

340
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,870
Being real is a joke in your world?

341
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah!

342
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,150
What's in the bag?

343
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,510
Our army.

344
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,010
Come here.

345
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,050
Never mind. You'll grow into it.

346
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,290
And so will you.

347
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,730
The machine's working out well, isn't it?

348
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,360
It would work better if you were out there
making the Earthling wish.

349
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,100
It's so cold out there.

350
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,930
That's the plan.

351
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,590
It's dangerous, but it just might work.

352
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,530
It has to work.

353
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:59,230
I'm glad you came back to Fantasia.

354
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,440
I am, too.

355
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,780
What if something happens to you?

356
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,150
Somebody must miss you in your world.

357
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,720
Nobody misses me.

358
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,490
But what about you?

359
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,320
Don't you miss somebody?

360
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,200
The only one I miss...

361
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,440
...isn't there.

362
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,240
Who's that?

363
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,190
My mom.

364
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:47,280
Look.

365
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,390
The Ivory Tower.

366
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,100
Now it's a prison.

367
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,340
We may never see the Empress again.

368
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,710
Right now...

369
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,240
...all we have are memories.

370
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,310
Bastian.

371
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,520
In your world...

372
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:24,880
...if The Neverending Story...

373
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,460
...is fading...

374
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,060
...no child will ever know...

375
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,800
...about Junior.

376
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:37,740
They'll never ride the prairie with me?

377
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,040
They'll never ride
through the clouds with me?

378
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,180
If humans...

379
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,120
...forget about us...

380
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,380
...nobody will think...

381
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:53,610
...of fun things...

382
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,680
...for Junior to do.

383
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,690
No!

384
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,740
We won't let that happen.

385
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,200
Bastian, here!

386
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,780
Atreyu, quick, help me!

387
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,180
I'm burning! It hurts!

388
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,280
I can't breathe!

389
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,080
Are you all right?

390
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,850
You saved my life, Atreyu.

391
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,150
Yes. But you would have done
the same for me.

392
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:45,890
Sure.

393
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,140
What's happening?

394
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,570
The beams! They've destroyed the beams!

395
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,610
Fix it!

396
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,880
Do you remember what to say?

397
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,250
Yeah.

398
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,860
Make it loud.

399
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,740
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

400
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,530
...and Atreyu...

401
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,370
...the warrior from the Great Plains...

402
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Is that what you call loud in your world?

403
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:40,120
The Earthling Bastian Balthazar Bux...

404
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,490
...and Atreyu,
the warrior from the Great Plains...

405
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:47,150
...demand to see the master of this castle!

406
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,100
That should get somebody's attention.

407
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,560
Guess whose?

408
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,010
Do they make strong gates in Fantasia?

409
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,940
Keep talking.

410
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:11,680
Keep talking!

411
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,530
Hi.

412
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,300
You're probably wondering why I'm here.

413
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:44,210
That's a reasonable question.

414
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,450
In the past we've had our differences...

415
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,790
...but I'm sure they can be worked out.

416
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:58,260
It all gets back to us
starting to communicate, right?

417
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,630
There's all kinds of communication.

418
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:04,900
Some do it with a look.

419
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,600
Some do it with a smile.

420
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,270
Some do it with...

421
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,210
...a sickle.

422
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,210
I read that somewhere. I like to read.

423
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,050
You're probably not interested.

424
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,560
You probably hate books.

425
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,800
Eggs? Eggs will do us a lot of good!

426
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,270
Wham-Bos, go!

427
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:51,350
Now's your chance, go!

428
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:52,980
What about them?

429
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:56,390
- It's a good day to die.
- Don't say that!

430
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,860
- Give me five!
- Five what?

431
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,990
Forget it! I'll see you inside.

432
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,010
I wish there was some other way in.

433
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:17,130
I wish for another step!

434
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,040
And another one.

435
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,450
And another.

436
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,270
And another one.

437
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,720
Nice. Very nice.

438
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,780
Giants!

439
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,390
I wish for another one!

440
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,660
And another!

441
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,450
Atreyu!

442
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,750
Try to swing around.

443
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,760
It won't work.

444
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,780
The chain.

445
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,480
Grab it!

446
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,430
Pull!

447
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,230
Pull!

448
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,910
Come on, pull!

449
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:24,390
We need weapons!

450
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,950
I wish for a spray can.

451
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,930
That's a weapon in your world?

452
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:32,590
People use it against walls.

453
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:34,830
Those walls must be dangerous.

454
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,190
I don't believe what we have done.

455
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,890
I do.

456
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:12,660
The Giants are empty.

457
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,230
They're hollow and empty.

458
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,510
Like the Rockbiter's stones...

459
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,450
...and the pages of The Neverending Story.

460
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,720
I know what threatens Fantasia.

461
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:31,620
You have found its name?

462
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:36,020
It's the Emptiness.

463
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:42,000
The Earthling knows about the Emptiness.

464
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:44,000
He's stronger than we thought.

465
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:47,230
Perhaps threatening him with Giants
isn't the way.

466
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,670
Time for a change of tactics.

467
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,490
What does the Emptiness look like?

468
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,540
How does it fight?

469
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:19,140
I think we're about to find out.

470
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:24,440
I wish for the doors to open!

471
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,420
I am Xayide.

472
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:10,220
This is my castle.

473
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:12,460
And the Giants?

474
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,130
They were mine.

475
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,430
But you have conquered them.

476
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,360
I admit defeat.

477
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:21,100
I have defeated you?

478
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,900
We.

479
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,340
That someone so young could be so clever.

480
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,500
You make everything empty.

481
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,840
I control all that is empty.

482
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:35,820
Just to control things,
you destroy stories and books?

483
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,220
I'm trying to bring order
to the chaos of Fantasia.

484
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:40,950
Am I wrong?

485
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,220
You certainly are! I demand that you free
the Childlike Empress!

486
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:46,950
- I can't.
- Why not?

487
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:49,360
I've isolated her forever.

488
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:51,830
You made the spell and you can undo it!

489
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,470
Not from here I can't.

490
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,060
So we'll go to the Ivory Tower.

491
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,130
I will not leave my castle.

492
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,600
- You will.
- Out of the question.

493
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,340
Perhaps she feels it's a good day to die.

494
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,780
Do you?

495
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,150
You leave me no choice, my lord.

496
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:53,260
Bastian?

497
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,390
"As Mr. Koreander searched
for a book on courage...

498
00:53:57,530 --> 00:54:00,430
"...Bastian picked up
The Neverending Story."

499
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,300
Mr. Koreander?

500
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:05,460
"If the pages of The Neverending Story
were fading...

501
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,770
"...no one would read about Falkor,
or Atreyu...

502
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,870
"...or the Childlike Empress.

503
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:14,350
"Bastian was the only one
who could save Fantasia...

504
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:16,750
"...and all the stories in the world.

505
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,240
"He had to do it, at any price."

506
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:24,080
Move it, dummy!

507
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,860
I should say not.

508
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:37,000
I am not going to carry that woman.

509
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,500
My Xobile will do just fine, gentlemen.

510
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:53,610
Would you ride with me, my lord?

511
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,280
Sure.

512
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,520
Come, then.

513
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,460
Welcome aboard.

514
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:12,240
Away!

515
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,040
We cannot leave him alone with her.

516
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:40,170
There was no "For Sale" sign this morning!

517
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:46,340
This is one sophisticated operation.

518
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:50,500
This morning this place was filled
with books, wall to wall!

519
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:58,940
Looks like there hasn't been
a bookstore here for a long time.

520
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,690
Are you sure it's the right address?

521
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,590
I'm not the type of person
to make things up.

522
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,590
I'm an engineer.
What I see is what I see...

523
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,290
We'll do what we can, Mr. Bux.

524
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,600
Don't you understand?

525
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,610
Atreyu's been jealous of you
since the first day you arrived here.

526
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,340
Why would he feel this way?
He's a great warrior.

527
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:33,050
Yes, but you have been chosen
to wear Auryn.

528
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,280
You may have to learn that some people
are not as grateful as others.

529
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:41,160
I want to express my gratitude...

530
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,930
...for the generosity you've shown me.

531
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,690
What is it?

532
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:50,700
It's a belt that makes its wearer invisible.

533
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,560
Want to try it on?

534
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,200
Okay.

535
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,360
This is weird.

536
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:19,260
What's the matter?

537
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,660
I can't see myself.

538
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,430
I can't even see the belt.

539
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,180
What if l can't take it off?

540
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,610
Use a wish.

541
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,470
I don't like this.

542
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,850
I wish...

543
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,780
You wish to be visible again?

544
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:41,050
Yes.

545
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,760
This is neat.

546
00:57:57,570 --> 00:57:59,560
It may come in handy.

547
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,340
Bastian!

548
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,020
Come here!

549
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:54,290
Don't be long. You'll catch a cold.

550
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,090
I'll be right back.

551
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,430
What's wrong?

552
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:08,030
I want to show you something.

553
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,210
Look. Tracks of the Xobile,
footprints of Artax.

554
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,950
What are you saying?

555
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:20,480
We're going around in circles.

556
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,090
But the countryside has been changing.

557
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,550
It doesn't make sense.

558
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:31,400
It does to someone who doesn't want us
closer to the Ivory Tower.

559
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,390
Xayide says we're nearly there.

560
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,300
Bastian, I'm waiting!

561
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:38,300
Just a moment.

562
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:43,570
She's our prisoner, Bastian.
Don't let her order you around.

563
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,540
How can you believe her?

564
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:50,310
How can we be sure she'll help us free
the Childlike Empress?

565
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,210
- I don't trust her.
- I can tell when someone lies to me.

566
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:58,190
And I can tell when
someone is up to no good.

567
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,160
She's totally under my control.
Don't worry.

568
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,790
"Bastian's head emptied with every wish.

569
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,730
"He hardly remembered his father...

570
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,070
"...who was worried sick
over his son's disappearance."

571
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,070
I'm in this book?

572
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,970
"Atreyu was worried too.

573
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,080
"The journey to the Ivory Tower
was going nowhere.

574
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,720
"As he tried once again
to talk sense into Bastian...

575
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,390
"...he was to learn even more
about Xayide's scheme."

576
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,090
Show me the coin trick again.

577
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,150
I've shown you a million times.

578
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,500
It must be the smoke in here.
It's hard to remember things.

579
01:01:18,870 --> 01:01:21,540
Why remember things
when you can wish for them?

580
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:25,200
What should I wish for?

581
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,180
What about juggling?
Wouldn't you enjoy that?

582
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,010
I can't juggle.

583
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,620
If you wish for it you can.

584
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,920
I wish it.

585
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:59,300
"Then the darkness lifted
and she could see her way home.

586
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:03,050
"So the princess returned
to her father's castle.

587
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,040
"And they all lived happily ever after."

588
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:20,230
Don't be afraid, Bastian.

589
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,900
We're all part of a neverending story.

590
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:28,470
We are?

591
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,410
Even if we die?

592
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,740
Yes, Bastian, we are.

593
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,760
That's good to know.

594
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,490
That's good to know.

595
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:01,500
From what you tell me...

596
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:05,100
...the Emptiness has found its way
into Bastian's head.

597
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,350
It's Auryn, isn't it?

598
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,280
It works differently with humans
than with us.

599
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,180
Because humans need memories.

600
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,310
So what I saw...

601
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,220
...was a memory.

602
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:43,410
If Bastian's so clever,
why can't he see what's happening?

603
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,920
Bastian is losing himself with every wish.

604
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,920
He must be stopped, or Fantasia's lost.

605
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,630
I'll take Auryn away from him by force,
if necessary.

606
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:04,900
He can't be allowed
to make one more wish.

607
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:10,010
I'll have to do it tonight.
Tomorrow we might be Xayide's prisoners.

608
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,820
Don't go to him in anger.
Go and warn him.

609
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:21,350
He's your friend, isn't he?

610
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:24,420
You're right.

611
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,550
He is my friend.

612
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,630
You're right. He has turned against me.

613
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,700
You need to protect yourself.

614
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,270
There could be Giants to take care of you...

615
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:47,300
...if you wish.

616
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,920
Stand guard!

617
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,580
Thief!

618
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,720
- I've come to warn you.
- Liar!

619
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:34,630
- Don't you ever say that to me!
- It's true!

620
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:38,200
You're jealous that I have Auryn,
and you've come to take it from me.

621
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,430
I have not!

622
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,060
I overheard you talking to Falkor,
so don't try and make excuses.

623
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:48,600
You've gone mad, Bastian. Give me Auryn.

624
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,610
She wants me to have it.

625
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,610
You don't understand anything.
Go back and play with your buffaloes...

626
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:55,770
...country boy!

627
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:59,380
Why don't you go back and play hero
in your own world, Earthling?

628
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:12,890
Every time you use Auryn,
you lose one of your memories.

629
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,160
Xayide has...

630
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:17,740
...a machine that collects them.

631
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:19,830
- I would have seen it...
- I have seen it.

632
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:22,240
It's in the roof of the Xobile.

633
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:28,910
A few more wishes,
and the Emptiness will possess you.

634
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,720
Give me Auryn before it's too late!

635
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:37,320
Take it if you can.

636
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:07,550
You brought this on yourself!

637
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,880
You've only two wishes to go.

638
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:34,570
But, my lord...

639
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,910
I didn't mean it.

640
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,780
Falkor!

641
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:46,250
Atreyu, I'm sorry!

642
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,230
Take me to Atreyu!

643
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,400
Giants!

644
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,070
My son on a horse?

645
01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,310
He can't ride a horse.

646
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:32,800
Who told the boy?

647
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:36,200
It's Nimbly's fault.
He's always hanging around the machine.

648
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:40,210
Thanks for nothing.
It's nice to have someone to count on.

649
01:08:40,610 --> 01:08:43,170
I do the counting around here.

650
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,620
It's your fault.

651
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,610
One...

652
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:51,180
...two...

653
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:56,520
...three!

654
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:07,140
"As he sank beneath the water, he knew...

655
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,800
"...that as punishment for killing Atreyu...

656
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,110
"...he would die himself."

657
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:26,120
Don't buy it, Bastian. Swim! Fight!

658
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:39,270
Yes!

659
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:43,110
According to the machine,
he has two wishes left.

660
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,330
There must be something wrong with it.

661
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,040
It's working perfectly.

662
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:50,410
Whatever you tried didn't work.
He didn't make a wish!

663
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:52,510
He will.

664
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:01,880
It's time.

665
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,700
Time to choose sides.

666
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,040
"Xayide and her Giants...

667
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,140
"...drove into the underworld of Fantasia.

668
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,120
"Here they could travel
with the speed of darkness...

669
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,520
"...which was faster
than the speed of light.

670
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:29,490
"They would find Bastian in no time
and force him to make his last wish."

671
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:48,130
Go on.

672
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:49,070
Keep trying.

673
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,210
Don't forget me, Bastian.

674
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,110
"Possessed by a deep, dreamless sleep...

675
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,250
"...he couldn't hear
the Childlike Empress's plea."

676
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:42,690
Mr. Bastian, wait!

677
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,460
I won't hurt you.

678
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:47,400
I've come to help you.

679
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:54,640
You don't give up, do you?

680
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:58,370
You expect me to believe you?

681
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:00,440
Yes, Mr. Bastian.

682
01:12:00,980 --> 01:12:02,380
You have to.

683
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,780
I saw...

684
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,290
...one of your memories.

685
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,590
It made me feel something.

686
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:27,660
I learned...

687
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,500
...that we're all part...

688
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:34,440
...of a neverending story.

689
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,720
Bastian, try to remember it.

690
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,180
Unless we stop Xayide...

691
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,950
...the story will end.

692
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,690
That's why I'm here.

693
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:49,920
Tell me where to find Falkor.

694
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:53,560
At the Silver City.

695
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,070
But you won't like what you see.

696
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,720
How do I get there?

697
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:14,780
Behind those rocks...

698
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:18,520
...you'll find a path through the mountains.

699
01:13:19,490 --> 01:13:21,050
On the other side...

700
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,950
...keep the sun on your back.

701
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:27,230
Follow your shadow for half a day.

702
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:32,170
Don't turn 'round.
The Emptiness will be on your heels.

703
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,910
Come with me.

704
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:44,280
I got the part of a spy
in this story, Mr. Bastian.

705
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:50,290
And he who spies and flies away...

706
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,950
...lives to spy another day.

707
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:01,800
Hurry, Mr. Bastian!

708
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:04,030
Keep the sun on your back!

709
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:13,110
"Alone once again, Bastian wandered,
determined to find Falkor.

710
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:18,640
"Climbing on a heap of black
and metal sheets and pilings...

711
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:22,950
"...he hardly recognized
the once proud and famous Silver City."

712
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:51,610
I thought we'd never see you again.

713
01:14:52,850 --> 01:14:54,650
Where have you been?

714
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,230
I have two wishes left, Falkor.

715
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,210
Well, if you use those wishes...

716
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,480
...you will have lost
your most precious memories.

717
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:25,520
My mother...

718
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,850
...and my father.

719
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:34,420
My mother...

720
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,290
...would have wanted it this way.

721
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:47,410
I wish for nothing more
than for Atreyu to live!

722
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,160
I'm sorry for what happened.

723
01:16:16,670 --> 01:16:18,190
Can you forgive me?

724
01:16:21,780 --> 01:16:23,040
Friends?

725
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,810
Friends.

726
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,950
Bastian made a wish, didn't he?

727
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:36,610
He gave you a very special memory.

728
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:42,350
Your mother would have been proud.

729
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:45,750
Who?

730
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,300
Falkor, you shouldn't have let him.

731
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,090
You're outnumbered and outdone, Bastian.

732
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,960
And you have only one wish left.

733
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:18,560
So use what's left of your brain
and wish to go home.

734
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,630
That's where you belong.

735
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:22,700
If I use my last wish...

736
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:24,600
Fantasia will be forgotten.

737
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:28,000
The Childlike Empress will be gone forever.

738
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,580
Go home...

739
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,010
...and leave Fantasia to me.

740
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,380
I won't betray the Childlike Empress!

741
01:17:37,450 --> 01:17:38,680
Very well.

742
01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:41,720
But how will your father feel
if he never sees you again?

743
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,250
My father...

744
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:55,690
Make your wish.

745
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:58,700
Wish to go home.

746
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:04,400
Yes, Xayide, I will make my last wish.

747
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:08,880
I wish...

748
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,720
...for you to have a heart.

749
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,490
You have found the only wish...

750
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:04,550
...powerful enough to save us, Bastian.

751
01:20:04,930 --> 01:20:07,560
The Emptiness cannot be destroyed.

752
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:10,430
It had to be filled with love.

753
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,630
And Auryn?

754
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:16,700
It's only a mirror of what's inside you.

755
01:20:17,010 --> 01:20:19,000
Courage comes from the heart...

756
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,940
...not from symbols.

757
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:25,680
If you've found courage, you can go home...

758
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,540
...and heal both our worlds.

759
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:32,150
I can't go home.

760
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:45,030
- That's the way home?
- Yes.

761
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,700
The only way.

762
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:57,670
You found courage.

763
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:03,590
Bastian, you have. You've found courage.

764
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:06,960
My father. That's his voice.

765
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,230
Now make a wish from your heart.

766
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:18,230
I wish to go home...

767
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:21,940
...and tell my dad...

768
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:25,530
...that I love him.

769
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:30,350
Good luck, Bastian.

770
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,510
Good luck!

771
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,850
You can do it, Bastian.

772
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:39,880
- I was worried about you.
- I'm sorry.

773
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,450
You're back.

774
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,790
You helped me, didn't you?

775
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,330
You heard me?

776
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:51,960
Of course I heard you.

777
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:57,800
I love you.

778
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:03,500
I love you very, very much.

779
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,650
I love you too, Dad.
