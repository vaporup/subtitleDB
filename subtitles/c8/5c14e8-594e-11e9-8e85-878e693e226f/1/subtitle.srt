1
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:14,451
# Back in school
you were high class

2
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,700
# Didn't say much to me

3
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:23,081
# Johnny said on the outside

4
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,415
# You were his beauty queen

5
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,540
# Have you heard
about the lonesome loser

6
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,580
# Beaten by the queen of hearts
every time

7
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:57,872
# Have you heard
about the lonesome loser

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,700
# He's a loser
but he still keeps on trying

9
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:27,081
# Sit down,
take a look at yourself

10
00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,700
# Don't you want to be somebody?

11
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,577
# Someday somebody's
going to see inside

12
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,825
# You have to face up,
you can't run and hide...

13
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,573
Love this song.

14
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,619
- You need a new car, Dad.
- No, I don't.

15
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,240
Yes, you do.
It's a piece of shit.

16
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,162
Hey, I love this car.

17
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:48,782
You were conceived
in the back of this car.

18
00:01:48,917 --> 00:01:51,454
Jesus!

19
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:57,323
Thanks, that's great.
I've got a mental image.

20
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,790
# He's a loser
but he still keeps on trying...

21
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,999
Heater doesn't work.
Doesn't even have a CD player.

22
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,787
And thank Christ for that.
Otherwise I'd have to listen

23
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:11,536
to that bloody heavy metal
wrist slitting shit you listen to.

24
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:13,874
You sound like an old man, Dad.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,207
There's nothing wrong
with a good melody.

26
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:19,075
Oh no, there's nothing wrong
with a good melody.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,163
Don't think that she's not sneaking
the odd one here and there.

28
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:33,827
Look out!

29
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:05,703
You sorted for alcohol?

30
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,996
I got shit loads, man.
Got the old man to pick it up.

31
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,158
- I'm OK.
- Coming to the after-party?

32
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:16,489
No, think we're just gonna smoke
and hang out.

33
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:21,579
Smoke and hang out?

34
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,040
Man, Holly's parents are overseas

35
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:27,159
and you're just gonna smoke
and hang out?

36
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:28,907
You got a raincoat?

37
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:33,115
Here, I've only got one,
ribbed, for her pleasure.

38
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,831
Seriously, take it dude.

39
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:38,655
It's only gonna run out of date
if I hang onto it.

40
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,907
Ahem!

41
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,366
Yes!
She said yes!

42
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,868
Hi.

43
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,037
Will you go to the dance with me?

44
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,822
Sorry Lola,
I'm going with Holly.

45
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:00,703
Sorry.

46
00:05:13,917 --> 00:05:16,374
Hey! Need a ride?

47
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,535
- You passed?
- Uh-huh.

48
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,114
Wow!
Well done.

49
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,083
So where do you want to go?

50
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:29,579
- Guess who asked me to the dance?
- Who?

51
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,994
- Guess.
- Brent, who was it?

52
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,038
Tell me.
Who is she?

53
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:44,828
I need more than that.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,536
Tell me.

55
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,329
I can't.
She's very sensitive.

56
00:05:55,292 --> 00:05:58,284
I'm very sensitive too.

57
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,910
Uh-uh.

58
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,490
Who is she?

59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,580
Not you.

60
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,453
Who is she?

61
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,574
I'll never tell.

62
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,749
# God is dead so meet the kids now,
they're on stage... #

63
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,829
Did you tell your mum
I was getting my license?

64
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,621
So this is where I pick you up from?

65
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,241
She's got to deal with it sometime.

66
00:07:56,833 --> 00:07:58,323
You sure?

67
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,494
OK.

68
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,822
I'll pick you up at seven?

69
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,824
I love you.

70
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:28,952
Lola Stone.

71
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:30,913
What?

72
00:08:31,042 --> 00:08:33,033
That's who asked me.

73
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:37,787
Well you should go with her.

74
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,205
Maybe she won't mind having
an emotional retard for a boyfriend.

75
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,953
How are you getting there?

76
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,285
Holly's picking me up.

77
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,115
She doesn't even have her licence.

78
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:31,453
She got it today.

79
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,410
I'll give you money for a cab.

80
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,329
What's the difference,
it's still a car.

81
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:39,618
I'm still in a car.

82
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,823
But they're experienced.

83
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,040
And I wasn't, so Dad died?

84
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,583
# I could mean the world to you
but that's predictable

85
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,030
# I could tell you secrets

86
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:49,581
# Don't be so sure
you wouldn't miss me

87
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:57,956
# Say you're in love like it's true... #

88
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,741
Brent?

89
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,951
# She's like a drug,
she's under my skin

90
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:05,372
# One of these days
these ways are gonna do me in

91
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,957
# What can I say

92
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:13,123
# I can't get away
from those sticky paws

93
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,538
# Sometimes the sweetest kittens
have the sharpest claws... #

94
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:19,283
You're a fucking rock star.

95
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,453
Let's go.

96
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,290
Wow, you look wicked.

97
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,827
Ahem!

98
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,155
- Er... Hi, Mrs. Valentine.
- Hello, Jamie.

99
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:58,204
Mia, your father wants to get a photo.

100
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,949
Could wait a sec, please?

101
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,661
Well did you thank Jamie
for the flowers?

102
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,453
- Oh, no, that's OK.
- Thanks.

103
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,655
Well, I couldn't find them in black.

104
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,822
I'll put them in some water.

105
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,664
Whoa!

106
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:21,040
Ringo! Here!

107
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,533
- Get out of there.
- Er...

108
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:26,989
Hey, hi.
How's it going, Mr. Valentine?

109
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,332
Busy, keeping the wolf
from the door.

110
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,291
Yep, excellent.

111
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,749
Let's get this photo then.

112
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:37,992
Mia, go and stand next to Jamie.

113
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,448
Smile.

114
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,615
And one for safety.

115
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,824
All right, we're going, bye.

116
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,993
OK.

117
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,661
Bye.

118
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,494
Be careful.

119
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,161
Yep.

120
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,619
Brent!

121
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,829
You're going to be late.

122
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,040
- Have you seen him?
- Hi, Carla.

123
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,408
Have you seen Brent?

124
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,665
# When it come to making love
to you, baby

125
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:04,207
# You got to be agile,
mobile and hostile... #

126
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,494
You OK?

127
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,994
Have you got any more
of that pot on you?

128
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,207
Er, yeah, yeah,
in my pocket.

129
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:20,166
That's why your dog
was sniffing my nuts.

130
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,283
No need to explain.

131
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:26,330
Oh, yeah, I just didn't want you to think
that I have a hygiene problem.

132
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,494
Why?

133
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,661
You expecting me
to suck your cock?

134
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,947
'Hello, this is Brent.
Leave a message.'

135
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,865
It's OK, Kahn.

136
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,289
Hello.

137
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,661
Carla.

138
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,082
Come on, we both know
Brent's done this before

139
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,415
and he's always turned up.

140
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,536
What do you mean,
they've stabbed the dog?

141
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,706
Milady.

142
00:21:48,167 --> 00:21:50,249
He looks dead.

143
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,072
- I didn't use that much.
- You've ruined it!

144
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,824
- There it is!
- Let me hear.

145
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,198
Boom-boom, boom-boom,
boom-boom.

146
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,287
# Am I not pretty enough?

147
00:22:17,417 --> 00:22:21,205
# Is my heart too broken?

148
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:25,155
# Do I cry too much?

149
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:28,955
# Am I too outspoken?

150
00:22:29,083 --> 00:22:33,076
# Don't I make you laugh?

151
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:37,076
# Should I try it harder?

152
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:42,282
# Why do you see
right through me?

153
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:48,490
# I live, I breathe

154
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:52,368
# I let it rain on me

155
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,118
# I sleep, I wake

156
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,619
# I try hard not to break

157
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,572
# I crave, I love

158
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:08,371
# I've waited long enough

159
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,416
# I try as hard as I can... #

160
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,372
Wait!

161
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,411
Tell me what it looks like.

162
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,203
Pretty as a picture.

163
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,123
Lola.

164
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:29,034
Press a little harder, Princess.

165
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,788
We can't hear you!

166
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,453
Take a photo!

167
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:49,948
Say...

168
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:52,825
..."Happy End Of School Dance".
- Too big!

169
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:55,244
Say..."happy"!

170
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:56,706
Happy!

171
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:02,409
- One with Bright Eyes?
- Quick.

172
00:27:20,042 --> 00:27:22,658
- Say...
- Just take it.

173
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:28,956
It was just a little flash,
nothing to be scared of.

174
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:39,655
# Let's roll,
so roll motherfuckers

175
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,704
# Let's roll, roll,
roll motherfuckers

176
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:10,370
# Let's roll

177
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,164
# Let's roll,
so roll motherfuckers

178
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,864
# Let's roll,
so roll motherfuckers... #

179
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:49,165
Hey, Dad...

180
00:28:50,042 --> 00:28:51,248
...make a wish.

181
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,999
My wish was for you anyway.

182
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:06,198
I wished for you too.

183
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,289
Who looks prettier?

184
00:29:17,708 --> 00:29:19,198
Me or Bright Eyes?

185
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,618
You both look pretty.

186
00:29:27,667 --> 00:29:30,124
What's the matter Bright Eyes,
you're not hungry?

187
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:37,995
Better not get too skinny...

188
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,624
...or Daddy won't like you any more,
will you, Daddy?

189
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,448
What are you looking at?

190
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,412
Do you want some?

191
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:13,741
# Open up for the aeroplane #

192
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,330
Is it finger licking good?

193
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,991
Is... it...

194
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,616
...finger... licking...

195
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,830
...GOOD?

196
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:33,954
Is it finger licking good?

197
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:55,032
Show me.

198
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:57,414
Toi...

199
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,999
What?

200
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,457
Toilet.

201
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:09,618
Toilet?

202
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:15,540
Not till you show me.

203
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,040
Show me!

204
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:30,413
Suck it.

205
00:32:47,667 --> 00:32:50,249
Still need to go?

206
00:32:56,625 --> 00:32:58,832
Ones or twos?

207
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:02,289
Ones?

208
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,494
Yeah?

209
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:40,414
Go.

210
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,249
Were you telling porky pies?

211
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,662
Bring the hammer, Daddy.

212
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,036
I killed your dog with this.

213
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,490
And a nail.

214
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:20,537
You've got 10 seconds to go
or Daddy's going to nail it to the chair.

215
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,740
One.

216
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,453
Two.

217
00:34:30,292 --> 00:34:31,828
Three.

218
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:35,448
Four.

219
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,323
Five.

220
00:34:40,083 --> 00:34:41,619
Six.

221
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:44,123
Seven.

222
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,990
Eight.

223
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,832
Nine.

224
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:04,079
It's crying.

225
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,947
I bet I kiss it better.

226
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:20,830
Or maybe I'll bite it off
so she can never kiss it again.

227
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:24,828
Princess!

228
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,578
- Oh! What happened?
- Where's Bright Eyes?

229
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:31,120
She's in her room
so she can't get out.

230
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,115
Where is he?

231
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:35,911
There he is!

232
00:37:36,042 --> 00:37:38,124
Keep it on him.

233
00:37:55,042 --> 00:37:57,499
Here, let me have a go.

234
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,032
Boys shouldn't hit girls.

235
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,407
Cry.

236
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,203
Cry!

237
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:37,243
Cry!

238
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:43,823
Cry!

239
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:48,749
Cry!

240
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,873
This one's for the Kingswood.

241
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,415
Here you are.

242
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:20,658
Thanks, Holly.

243
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,664
He thinks I blame him.

244
00:40:38,917 --> 00:40:40,532
Do you?

245
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:02,158
That's me.

246
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:08,783
Oh... Keir Willis.

247
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:11,283
He was such a baby.

248
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,412
That's me again.

249
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,578
Duncan Fletcher.

250
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,448
He wet himself.

251
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,957
It was so funny.

252
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,698
See?

253
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,290
He wet his pants.

254
00:41:58,542 --> 00:42:00,999
Rhys Agnew.

255
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,616
Boring!

256
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:10,454
Here's the one that got away.

257
00:42:10,583 --> 00:42:12,289
Timmy Valentine.

258
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:26,033
He's probably dead by now.

259
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:34,120
And lucky last...

260
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:41,657
Oh!

261
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:52,039
I'm ready to draw on him now.

262
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,208
Shall we go in after this?

263
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,198
Sick of me already?

264
00:43:19,333 --> 00:43:21,619
No. No, I just thought...

265
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,082
...you know, maybe we should
eat something.

266
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,749
Come here.

267
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:35,911
I'll feed you.

268
00:43:56,417 --> 00:43:59,489
Your drawing gets better every time.

269
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,498
Throw it.

270
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:15,330
Not too much.
It's supposed to be bad for you.

271
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:47,246
We can't hear you!

272
00:44:47,375 --> 00:44:51,323
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!

273
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:08,617
Maybe...
Maybe we should go in.

274
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:23,832
Oh, here! You all right?

275
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,040
And this year's
Queen of the Dance is...

276
00:46:42,542 --> 00:46:44,203
...Lola Stone!

277
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,410
Blow your whistle, King.

278
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,074
Blow your whistle, King.

279
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:11,327
Daddy!

280
00:47:20,833 --> 00:47:22,289
Crown me.

281
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:19,240
# I've been tried and then tempted

282
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:24,998
# But now I'm leaving today

283
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:28,993
# All we had, baby's over

284
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:33,706
# So I be on my way

285
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:39,161
# Go onto another

286
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:43,114
# And don't you pay me no mind

287
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,744
# You're yet to discover

288
00:48:48,875 --> 00:48:52,697
# Loving something you'll find

289
00:48:54,458 --> 00:49:02,285
# Oh, my head in my hands,
it is sinking

290
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:11,705
# And my heart inside me is torn

291
00:49:14,083 --> 00:49:18,372
# Are you sitting true...

292
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,411
What the fuck are you looking at?

293
00:49:20,542 --> 00:49:23,158
#... we were through

294
00:49:23,292 --> 00:49:27,114
# But I'll be oh, so lonesome... #

295
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:31,823
If you want to do that sort of thing
I suggest you go somewhere else.

296
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:48,034
# Am I not pretty enough?

297
00:49:48,167 --> 00:49:51,534
# Is my heart too broken?

298
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:56,036
# Do I cry too much?

299
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:59,864
# Am I too outspoken?

300
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,993
# Don't I make you laugh?

301
00:50:04,125 --> 00:50:07,697
# Should I try it harder?

302
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:08,822
# Why do you see...

303
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:11,324
When I find my Prince,

304
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:15,701
this is the song we're gonna dance to
at my wedding.

305
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:19,405
# I live, I breathe

306
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:22,705
# I let it rain on me

307
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:23,868
# I see... #

308
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,117
But you're not him.

309
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:29,992
You're just another FROG!

310
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:35,197
# I crave, I love

311
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:39,246
# I've waited long enough...

312
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:41,873
Dance with me, Daddy.

313
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:52,202
# Am I not pretty enough?

314
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,996
# Is my heart too broken?

315
00:50:56,125 --> 00:51:03,702
# Do I cry too much?

316
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:07,951
# Am I too outspoken?
# Don't I make you laugh?

317
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:11,780
# Should I try it harder?

318
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:17,116
# Why do you see
right through me?

319
00:51:19,333 --> 00:51:23,076
# I laugh, I feel

320
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:26,826
# I make believe it's real

321
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:31,122
# I fall, I freeze

322
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,493
# I pray down on my knees

323
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,867
# I hope, I stand

324
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,073
# I take it like a man... #

325
00:51:43,208 --> 00:51:45,745
You're the Prince.

326
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:53,825
That's why I can't find one I like.

327
00:51:57,917 --> 00:52:00,750
It's always been you, Daddy.

328
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:06,158
Just you and me...

329
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,906
# Don't I make you laugh?

330
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:15,990
# Should I try it harder?

331
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:21,574
#Why do you see
right through me?

332
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:22,697
# Why do you... #

333
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:34,369
Thanks.

334
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,243
I contacted Search & Rescue.
They'll be here in the morning.

335
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:43,497
But if you think of anything
or you need me, you ring me.

336
00:52:44,667 --> 00:52:46,999
We'll find him.

337
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:05,870
'The person you are calling
is unavailable.'

338
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,615
'Leave a message after the tone.'

339
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:12,619
Hi Mum, I think it's late over there
so you're probably asleep.

340
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:14,786
So er...

341
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:17,329
I'll try again later.

342
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:19,323
OK, bye.

343
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,161
Catch!

344
00:54:12,792 --> 00:54:17,331
Drinkie, drinkie.
Sing for your supper.

345
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:22,203
Not loud enough.

346
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:30,700
# She's a lost cause,
she's a lost, lost cause... #

347
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:47,573
Fuck me.

348
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

349
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:27,409
When I said go somewhere else
I meant off school property.

350
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,995
You're my first drilling.

351
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,206
The trick is not to go too far.

352
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:57,244
Just enough
to break through the skull.

353
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:06,614
- Do you know how to turn it on?
- I'm not stupid.

354
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,913
Remove the King's crown,
please, Daddy.

355
00:56:56,708 --> 00:56:58,289
You've got to push harder.

356
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:01,282
Two hands.

357
00:57:02,958 --> 00:57:04,744
Cradle it into the body.

358
00:57:07,542 --> 00:57:08,748
That's the way.

359
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,036
Stop!

360
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,664
Perfect.

361
00:58:33,542 --> 00:58:36,534
It works, you know.

362
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:41,411
It boils your brains
and turns you into one of them.

363
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:51,158
Careful, it's hot.

364
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,536
Sorry!

365
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,869
You've got to give it a bigger tip.

366
00:59:44,542 --> 00:59:47,124
The hole's too small,
can you please make it bigger?

367
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,413
Daddy?

368
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,243
Daddy!

369
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,740
Daddy!

370
01:02:51,917 --> 01:02:53,498
Daddy.

371
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:29,579
OK. You all right?
Mmm.

372
01:04:29,708 --> 01:04:33,246
All right.
Now, we've just got two steps.

373
01:05:08,333 --> 01:05:11,496
Must've danced her off her feet.

374
01:06:20,958 --> 01:06:23,415
Why can't you find him?

375
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,333
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.

376
01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:22,957
Good night, Mummy.

377
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:46,038
'Lola Stone.
That's who asked me.'

378
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:13,623
Hello?

379
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:33,704
I'm going to your house now.

380
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:36,620
I'm going to stab your mummy
in the neck,

381
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:38,991
just like you did to my daddy.

382
01:10:47,167 --> 01:10:51,080
And then I'm going to stab Holly
in the heart.

383
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:54,496
Just like you did to me.

384
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:02,198
# Am I not pretty enough?

385
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:07,994
# Is my heart too broken?

386
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:13,740
# Do I cry too much?

387
01:12:14,708 --> 01:12:19,702
# Am I too outspoken?

388
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:25,289
# Don't I make you laugh?

389
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,324
# Should I try harder?

390
01:12:32,333 --> 01:12:39,330
# Why do you see
right through me? #
