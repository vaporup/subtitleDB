1
00:00:21,611 --> 00:00:22,879
This is Salvage One!

2
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,247
We have secured the Sleeper sample,

3
00:00:24,247 --> 00:00:25,916
but we're going to need
some additional support

4
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,885
to clear the Blue
from our escape route!

5
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:30,954
Salvage One we've got
our hands full down here!

6
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:32,556
Just leave the fighting
to the Armor Shrikes

7
00:00:32,556 --> 00:00:34,858
and get the hell out of there now!

8
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:35,625
Copy that!

9
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,128
We'll move the Sleeper to the
recon point and meet you there!

10
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:39,390
Over!

11
00:01:14,771 --> 00:01:16,940
I'm picking up some
bionoise at 10 o'clock!

12
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,373
Get ready!

13
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,352
Hey! Hey!

14
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,274
Don't touch me!

15
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,387
Please don't!

16
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,234
Salvage One! What's going on?
Report in at once!

17
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:27,004
The Sleeper is out of his
capsule and is now on the run.

18
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:29,706
What the hell?
Dammit! Go get him!

19
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,266
Yes sir! I'm in pursuit!
He won't get away!

20
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:08,945
This can't be? It can't!

21
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:13,109
None of this is real!
It's insane!

22
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:27,764
Stay back!

23
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:31,359
G-go away! Please go away!

24
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:48,507
So Sleeper, how the
hell did you wake up?

25
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,194
I don't want you to
cause me any more trouble.

26
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:08,221
So unless you'd rather die,
you will follow my orders.

27
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:51,842
Hey Marlene, need a hand!

28
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:53,605
Keith! Joey!

29
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:56,206
Yeah!

30
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:07,016
Hey, I got something for ya!
Come and get it!

31
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:14,393
That's enough Keith!
Leave the rest to Bull's Eye!

32
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,337
Now run!

33
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,162
Let's move out!
But leave 'em a present!

34
00:07:46,162 --> 00:07:47,686
Copy that!

35
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:11,176
What are you doing?
Get in the jeep now!

36
00:09:07,344 --> 00:09:11,281
Hey! How long was
I in that capsule?

37
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:14,842
I figure that it has to
be at least a year or two.

38
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,960
This may come as a shock to you,
but the year is 2031.

39
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,729
And that means that
it's been 22 years

40
00:09:25,729 --> 00:09:29,062
since you Sleepers first
went into those capsules.

41
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,395
Wow? That long huh?

42
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,405
Those things back there!

43
00:09:35,405 --> 00:09:38,508
They killed everyone but me?
Are you sure?

44
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:41,411
Maybe we should go back
and look for survivors?

45
00:09:41,411 --> 00:09:43,380
That facility is really big!

46
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,249
There could be more people
like me all over the place!

47
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:50,743
Dammit! I want to know
where you're taking me!

48
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,150
His name is Yuji Kaido.

49
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,851
He was born in 1992.

50
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,587
Says his sleep treatment
began in 2009.

51
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:28,191
I heard that those Sleepers came down
with some kind of viral infection.

52
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,292
That's right!

53
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:31,594
They called it the Prophecy Syndrome.

54
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:35,265
The subjects went crazy and began
speaking all kinds of nonsense.

55
00:10:35,265 --> 00:10:38,168
They claimed to be haunted by visions.

56
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:39,803
But why start moving them now

57
00:10:39,803 --> 00:10:42,105
after they've been sitting
on the surface for so long?

58
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,538
I have no idea.

59
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,609
It's been a lot of trouble
retrieving these Sleepers.

60
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:48,611
I damn sure hope it's worth it.

61
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,306
It better be!

62
00:11:00,757 --> 00:11:03,317
So, how's our Sleeper doing?

63
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,528
This may be hard to believe,

64
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,797
but I'm from the same
generation as you.

65
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:10,633
Yeah. Back then,
we lived the good life.

66
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:11,868
Then the Blue...

67
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:14,337
They changed everything
for us here on the planet.

68
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:18,408
Mankind has lived in terror
ever since their arrival.

69
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:20,035
The Blue?

70
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:23,379
That's what those creatures are called!

71
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:26,883
They've destroyed the civilization
that you once knew by devouring it.

72
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,753
The population that remains
has been forced into space.

73
00:11:29,753 --> 00:11:31,454
As you've seen for yourself,

74
00:11:31,454 --> 00:11:35,425
the Earth has become a
very hostile environment.

75
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:39,996
Those Blue creatures have
eaten away everything?

76
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,232
So it's all gone?

77
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:46,328
Everything I knew... It's gone?

78
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:12,225
This is Tokyo 22 years later?

79
00:12:13,229 --> 00:12:14,631
So much has changed,

80
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:18,902
but to me it feels like
only one night has passed.

81
00:12:18,902 --> 00:12:22,205
It's like a bad dream
that I can't wake up from.

82
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:26,539
And if this is the way things are
then I wish they never found me.

83
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,511
Where are we?

84
00:13:01,511 --> 00:13:02,979
It's a spaceport.

85
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,481
They've become more common
since you went to sleep.

86
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,684
So you mean we're going into space?

87
00:13:07,684 --> 00:13:08,585
That's right!

88
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,816
We have a base in orbit
from which we run our operations!

89
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:14,950
You mean a space station?

90
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:19,529
What're those?

91
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,031
Sleepers like you recovered
from other areas...

92
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:23,633
Only they haven't woken up.

93
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:26,625
There were a number of facilities
all over the country!

94
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,762
Stop!

95
00:13:29,672 --> 00:13:32,308
Hey! Come back!

96
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:36,074
I'm not the only one! I'm not
the only one that survived!

97
00:13:36,846 --> 00:13:38,245
Move out!

98
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:40,239
What's that?!

99
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:46,346
What's going on up there?

100
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,553
My god!

101
00:13:55,732 --> 00:13:58,468
All Armor Shrikes on deck!
The Blue are invading!

102
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,368
They're coming up
through the ground!

103
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:20,117
Malcolm! Come on!
Get me over there!

104
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:29,457
No! I have to wake the others up!

105
00:14:36,205 --> 00:14:38,041
Somebody! Smash its neuro-point!

106
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,542
Hurry!

107
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:42,445
Keith! What the hell
are you waiting for?

108
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:43,513
Hold it steady!

109
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,649
I'm going to shove our arm
so far up that bug's ass

110
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,640
it explodes!

111
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,559
Wake up! C'mon wake up!

112
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,296
You gotta wake up in there
or you'll all be killed!

113
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:03,166
Stop it or you're gonna be
the one that gets killed!

114
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:06,569
You don't understand!
We've got to wake them up!

115
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:10,106
Please! I can't go
through this hell alone!

116
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:13,075
Wake up! Please wake up!

117
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,117
You've got to stop this.
It's hopeless.

118
00:15:21,117 --> 00:15:24,484
There's no way to
resusitate them down here!

119
00:15:46,242 --> 00:15:47,573
Get in!

120
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:57,651
I'm picking up a lot of
bionoise on the scanner!

121
00:15:59,122 --> 00:16:01,147
Get to the shuttle!

122
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:11,461
Wait! We've got to bring
the other Sleepers with us!

123
00:16:29,552 --> 00:16:30,917
No!

124
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,259
Damn them!

125
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,294
Damn this world!

126
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:40,762
Damn it all!

127
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,308
Training?

128
00:16:52,308 --> 00:16:55,044
Just enough for me to
look after myself down here.

129
00:16:55,044 --> 00:16:57,713
I want to try and
help out if I can.

130
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:59,949
I don't want to be
a burden to anyone.

131
00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:01,684
You gotta train me!

132
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,586
No way!

133
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,887
But why not?

134
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:07,190
My duty is to deliver
you to Second Earth.

135
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,358
And I intend to see
you get there alive.

136
00:17:09,358 --> 00:17:12,028
I will not let you
jeopardize this mission.

137
00:17:12,028 --> 00:17:13,629
We've lost the other
recovered Sleepers,

138
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:16,120
and you're our only
surviving sample.

139
00:17:16,666 --> 00:17:18,968
Sample?

140
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:20,403
Hey Marlene...

141
00:17:20,403 --> 00:17:23,673
Keith and Malcolm are dead,
and Robert's wounded.

142
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,508
That leaves the two of
us to pick up the slack.

143
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:28,377
Bringing on an extra pair of
hands might not be a bad idea.

144
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:30,780
I mean it's not like
we can't use the help!

145
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,849
If I teach Yuji to
drive the Armor Shrike,

146
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:33,816
and you teach him to shoot,

147
00:17:33,816 --> 00:17:37,153
in a few days we might be
able to use him in combat.

148
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:41,419
I refuse to die
without a fight! Teach me!

149
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,698
All right, but you have three days!

150
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:50,256
Sure, it's a deal.

151
00:17:51,534 --> 00:17:52,831
Let's get to work!

152
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:03,209
There! That's better!

153
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:20,163
The idea is to get close enough
to the Blue to use the grappler arms.

154
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:22,331
But don't forget they won't
exactly be sitting still,

155
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:24,734
so pay attention.

156
00:18:24,734 --> 00:18:26,759
Let's go!

157
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:38,114
Damn that was fast!

158
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,016
Hey, ease up on the controls!

159
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:41,574
Right!

160
00:18:50,126 --> 00:18:52,161
That's wrong!

161
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:53,262
You're too stiff.

162
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:55,264
Try keeping your right elbow bent.

163
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,562
That way your left
hand will be steadier.

164
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:21,457
Keep your eyes focused.

165
00:19:21,457 --> 00:19:23,721
Concentrate!

166
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,911
We hit it!

167
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:44,778
I think you've got a knack for this!

168
00:19:55,091 --> 00:19:57,252
Bionoise detected!

169
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:00,763
Confirm the enemy's number!

170
00:20:00,763 --> 00:20:04,233
I'm reading three, no four!
I'm reading four of them!

171
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:08,226
Intercept! Marlene I want you
to assume tactical command!

172
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,885
I just took out one of the flying Blue.

173
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:24,720
I'll go get the other
two then I'll come up

174
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,523
and help you finish off the last one!
Until then, keep it occupied.

175
00:20:27,523 --> 00:20:28,758
You got it!

176
00:20:28,758 --> 00:20:30,426
Yuji don't do anything stupid!

177
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,621
Okay! Okay! I got it!

178
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,548
Come on!

179
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:53,783
Where the hell are they hiding?

180
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:57,019
Come out! Come out and show yourself,
you monsters!

181
00:20:57,019 --> 00:20:59,886
Yuji! Hey Yuji!

182
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,927
Try to relax, but keep your eyes open!

183
00:21:04,927 --> 00:21:07,657
The... The Blue!

184
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:10,055
Where the hell is it?

185
00:21:13,703 --> 00:21:15,068
Yuji! Above us!

186
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:28,541
Yuji!

187
00:21:33,089 --> 00:21:35,785
Go on! Blast it Yuji!

188
00:21:39,428 --> 00:21:42,659
Oh god! It's right on top of me!

189
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:51,637
Come on! Blast that thing!

190
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:54,976
Yuji! Ready yourself!

191
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,249
If we keep going at this pace,

192
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:35,918
we should arrive at the
Korean Coast sometime tomorrow.

193
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:38,154
Have you made contact
with the recovery squad?

194
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:40,222
Unfortunately, there's
been no response sir.

195
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:41,883
I see.

196
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:20,129
You know, after all
the Blue we've seen,

197
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:23,292
I doubt there's much left
of the Korean recovery squad!

198
00:23:25,034 --> 00:23:27,059
Joey! Stop right here!

199
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:32,400
We won't make it over
the bridge in this.

200
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:53,692
Joey! Take him!

201
00:23:55,764 --> 00:23:57,391
Yuji stop!

202
00:23:59,935 --> 00:24:02,426
Where did she go?

203
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:13,010
My god!

204
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,518
Hey! Hello?!

205
00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:48,410
What's going on here?

206
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:53,923
Wait! Hold on.

207
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:55,858
Hey, don't run away from me.

208
00:24:55,858 --> 00:25:01,660
I'm just like you.
I'm not one of those monsters.

209
00:25:04,266 --> 00:25:05,426
Maru!

210
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:16,178
Oh? Maru! So that's
your name, is it boy?

211
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:20,012
Yeah I know, I'm glad
to be alive too!

212
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:26,822
Yung! Stay away from
this guy! Ya hear me?

213
00:25:26,822 --> 00:25:31,293
But Daddy, I think this nice man
came here to kill all the monsters!

214
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:33,896
No! You know better.

215
00:25:33,896 --> 00:25:36,298
You can't count on the
people from Second Earth.

216
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:42,371
They could care less about you
or me or anybody else down here!

217
00:25:42,371 --> 00:25:44,673
So pal, don't try and
tell me you've come here

218
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,437
to take pity on us worthless folk!

219
00:25:56,986 --> 00:26:00,046
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

220
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:05,959
I just wanted...
I wanted to help.

221
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:13,002
Who the hell gave you
permission to go off on your own?

222
00:26:13,002 --> 00:26:14,303
But you don't understand.

223
00:26:14,303 --> 00:26:16,805
There are still
survivors in this city!

224
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:19,341
They're been keeping themselves
alive by their own means,

225
00:26:19,341 --> 00:26:21,076
but they could use our help.

226
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:24,780
If we don't do something,
they're not going to make it!

227
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,782
You know they all hate us, don't you?

228
00:26:26,782 --> 00:26:30,586
Look, it's time for you to face
the reality we're living in!

229
00:26:30,586 --> 00:26:32,154
When the Blue took over the planet,

230
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:34,390
mankind was forced to
make some tough decisions.

231
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,226
The survival of our species
has come at a cost!

232
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,461
Only the intellectuals,
the problem solvers,

233
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:41,530
and the military minded
were taken into space

234
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,799
and enlisted to fight the Blue.

235
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:44,900
And the others...

236
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,569
The weak and the sick had
to fend for themselves.

237
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:49,738
It's the only way we could survive.

238
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:53,008
Yeah? Well that sounds more
like selective genocide to me!

239
00:26:53,008 --> 00:26:58,480
No Yuji, you've forgotten this
is a different time and place.

240
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,950
Don't you see? There is no other way.

241
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,054
This is a life and death struggle
between the human race and the Blue.

242
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,023
And those who can't fight
don't deserve to survive.

243
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:10,225
If that's what you believe,

244
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:14,063
then I'd rather stay here than go
to Second Earth with people like you!

245
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:17,726
I'm a free man! I don't need
your permission to do anything!

246
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:24,571
Those who can't fight
don't deserve to survive?

247
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,248
Hey boy!

248
00:27:36,452 --> 00:27:37,519
Yung?

249
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,043
Here.

250
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,429
Know what mister?

251
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,165
You're different from
all those other soldiers.

252
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:51,894
Like Marlene.

253
00:27:52,835 --> 00:27:56,066
Well, that's because I'm from a
different time than they are Yung!

254
00:27:57,873 --> 00:28:00,242
I was asleep for a long time.

255
00:28:00,242 --> 00:28:03,645
But that was long
before you were born.

256
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:06,749
Back then I had hope
for the future.

257
00:28:06,749 --> 00:28:10,708
But the future doesn't look
so bright these days does it?

258
00:28:13,255 --> 00:28:17,025
I wish I could go
to sleep for a long time.

259
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:20,791
I bet you when you're asleep
the monsters can't get you!

260
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:26,401
Yung, don't worry.

261
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,805
No matter what happens,
I'm gonna protect you!

262
00:28:29,805 --> 00:28:32,141
You will?

263
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:35,008
Hey, I'm your friend right?

264
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,318
You know you can't do a
thing for that little girl.

265
00:28:43,318 --> 00:28:45,548
Damned liar!

266
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,333
This is a very dangerous area.

267
00:28:58,333 --> 00:29:00,869
We have no way of knowing
when the Blue will come ashore!

268
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,571
What do you think we should do?

269
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:05,607
The closest shuttle launch
site is far away in Russia.

270
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:09,044
It's at Baikonur. We could go there.

271
00:29:09,044 --> 00:29:12,815
By my estimation, it's at least 5000
kilometers that we'll have to cover.

272
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:15,284
Oh great! By the time
we get to Baikonur,

273
00:29:15,284 --> 00:29:19,482
I bet the recovery squad will already
have left for Second Earth without us.

274
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,460
We've got no choice.
We have to keep going.

275
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,330
Our orders are to get the
Sleeper on board a shuttle

276
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,195
to Second Earth at any cost!

277
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:35,070
So we're going to sneak away
and abandon those people?

278
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,438
You're way out of line!

279
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:40,609
Even if we wanted to, we don't have
the extra resources to waste on them.

280
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:42,477
I'm afraid Marlene's right, Yuji.

281
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:44,613
They'll have to make it on their own.

282
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:47,249
The Blue will start
gathering on this island,

283
00:29:47,249 --> 00:29:50,919
and we don't have the fire power
to save anybody but ourselves!

284
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,090
Well, if that's the situation,
can't we save the girl?

285
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,220
So you're saying that she's the
only one worthy of being saved?

286
00:30:02,431 --> 00:30:05,923
Dammit! Hang on everyone!
We've got company!

287
00:30:07,436 --> 00:30:09,404
Give me a hand up here!

288
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,677
Let's get this done people!
We don't have any time to waste!

289
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:17,167
Understood!

290
00:30:20,349 --> 00:30:22,715
Alright here we go!

291
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,687
Joey! Get out of there!

292
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:50,939
Marlene!

293
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:47,731
Marlene...

294
00:32:23,405 --> 00:32:25,066
Joey...

295
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,150
Pull yourself together!

296
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:49,361
You've got to be tough!

297
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:27,895
It's just going to be the
two of us from here on out.

298
00:33:31,206 --> 00:33:34,209
We're going to move on,
to Baikonur base.

299
00:33:34,209 --> 00:33:38,113
I intend to complete my
mission no matter what.

300
00:33:38,113 --> 00:33:40,445
Do you understand?

301
00:35:48,243 --> 00:35:50,512
What's wrong with you?

302
00:35:50,512 --> 00:35:54,516
If you don't like what happened
in Seoul then just say so!

303
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:58,520
What happened in your life
that made you so cold?

304
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,623
They're all dead!
Joey, Robert and Yung!

305
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,525
And we couldn't do a
thing to save them,

306
00:36:03,525 --> 00:36:06,358
and somehow that doesn't
bother you at all?

307
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,765
It doesn't bother you in the slightest

308
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:14,035
that your own people died
right in front of your eyes?

309
00:36:14,035 --> 00:36:16,771
How can you think nothing of it?
What's wrong with you?

310
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:19,541
All over this planet,
people die every day.

311
00:36:19,541 --> 00:36:22,101
And I've gotten used to it.

312
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:24,611
You bitch!

313
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,882
Are you even human?

314
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:30,442
Yeah, I'm human.

315
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:42,998
Yuji wake up! You're lucky!

316
00:36:42,998 --> 00:36:44,899
You've come this far and you're alive!

317
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:46,768
Now don't push your luck.

318
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:49,871
Down here only the strong survive,
and to hell with the rest of them!

319
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:50,805
That's just the way it is!

320
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:54,242
If you're weak, you're no good
to anyone and you deserve to die?

321
00:36:54,242 --> 00:36:55,810
You're right about one thing...

322
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,013
There is no humanity
left in this world!

323
00:36:58,013 --> 00:37:00,148
I can hardly wait
to meet your superiors!

324
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,084
I'll thank them personally
for sparing my life!

325
00:37:03,084 --> 00:37:05,712
I bet they're no better than the Blue!

326
00:37:17,198 --> 00:37:22,437
All right, do you want me
to end this right now?

327
00:37:22,437 --> 00:37:24,539
"The Sleeper took ill and died"

328
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:27,667
That's all I'll have
to put in my report.

329
00:37:57,872 --> 00:38:01,638
My god! Yung!

330
00:38:18,727 --> 00:38:22,026
Oh no, the Blue are here?

331
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:25,225
Oh my god!

332
00:38:26,968 --> 00:38:31,234
Stay away you monsters!
I'll kill you all!

333
00:38:34,275 --> 00:38:36,004
Yuji!

334
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:31,099
You should try and sleep.

335
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:34,602
Marlene, what happened?

336
00:39:34,602 --> 00:39:36,271
Yuji...

337
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:37,033
Yeah?

338
00:39:38,173 --> 00:39:41,476
The human race is almost extinct.

339
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:45,037
Civilization as you know
it is a thing of the past!

340
00:39:46,981 --> 00:39:51,019
There isn't any room left for
sympathy towards others anymore.

341
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:54,322
Try to survive.
That's all you can do.

342
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:58,960
Turn your hatred for the Blue
into a passion for staying alive.

343
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,831
The past is gone Yuji.
You have to let it go!

344
00:40:02,831 --> 00:40:03,898
I'm trying.

345
00:40:03,898 --> 00:40:07,202
It's hard 'cause I know something
better is alive down here.

346
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,571
Even in you.

347
00:40:09,571 --> 00:40:13,475
Yuji, I'm just doing my duty.

348
00:40:13,475 --> 00:40:16,978
Yeah, somehow I knew you
were going to say that!

349
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:20,482
Marlene, you've grown up knowing
that you could die at any moment.

350
00:40:20,482 --> 00:40:23,384
So I know it's hard for you
to show your true feelings.

351
00:40:23,384 --> 00:40:26,554
But I think deep down inside,
you and I are alike.

352
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,122
It's hard for me to explain.

353
00:40:28,122 --> 00:40:29,390
But when I found out I was sick,

354
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:31,693
that's when I realized
how precious life is.

355
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,328
And after all we've
been through together,

356
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:34,629
I feel it even more.

357
00:40:34,629 --> 00:40:36,431
You must feel the same way.

358
00:40:36,431 --> 00:40:40,869
Marlene, there must be a reason
why you and I are both here.

359
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:43,838
I know, there has to be.

360
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,626
Yuji.

361
00:41:04,626 --> 00:41:05,727
What is it?

362
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:09,330
You still have a very good chance
of surviving your illness.

363
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,566
And if you don't want
to go to Second Earth,

364
00:41:11,566 --> 00:41:13,334
then I won't force you.

365
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:15,336
I'll just change my report.

366
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:19,474
I'll say that you were killed
in a surprise attack by the Blue.

367
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:21,533
What made you change your mind?

368
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:25,079
I just want to give you
a chance to live the life

369
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:27,448
that you feel you're entitled too.

370
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:29,382
It's that simple.

371
00:42:09,324 --> 00:42:10,882
Marlene!

372
00:42:29,744 --> 00:42:31,109
Are you all right?

373
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:58,172
That was a close call.
I guess I owe you one, huh?

374
00:42:58,172 --> 00:43:02,404
The thin air up here must be
starting to affect my judgement.

375
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,787
Hey, it's okay. I know that you
would have done the same for me.

376
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:14,555
You don't owe me anything.

377
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:17,759
This is all about survival,
and I'm going to take your advice

378
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:20,294
and do my best to
stay alive from now on.

379
00:43:20,294 --> 00:43:22,096
I still don't
understand this world,

380
00:43:22,096 --> 00:43:24,666
but I'm ready to leave my
past behind and move on.

381
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,000
So let's go.

382
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,036
If we waste time, we'll miss
our ride to Second Earth.

383
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,231
Come on!

384
00:45:01,496 --> 00:45:03,731
You want to get past these
guys you gotta cut the power!

385
00:45:03,731 --> 00:45:07,098
Oh by the way,
welcome to Baikonur space base!

386
00:45:12,406 --> 00:45:13,775
There's a lot of Blue out there!

387
00:45:13,775 --> 00:45:14,942
Don't worry!

388
00:45:14,942 --> 00:45:16,344
The automatons will take care of them.

389
00:45:16,344 --> 00:45:19,981
Unfortunately we've discovered an
abnormality in their A.I. programming.

390
00:45:19,981 --> 00:45:21,415
As you found out for yourself,

391
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:23,217
for some reason they
can't tell the difference

392
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:25,310
between a human and the Blue!

393
00:45:28,623 --> 00:45:30,558
Because of this glitch
we've had a hell of a time

394
00:45:30,558 --> 00:45:32,727
getting to the shuttle
base's central area.

395
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,595
Luckily they've continued
fighting the Blue

396
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:37,565
that are nesting in
the surrounding facilities.

397
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:39,834
We're going to make another
attempt at launching the shuttle,

398
00:45:39,834 --> 00:45:42,103
but we'll need to double the
strength of our advance team.

399
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:44,906
Time is running out, so we're
going to initiate an attack

400
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:47,306
on the Blue Nest ourselves!

401
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:56,317
Second Earth. Wow, I'm
actually going into space.

402
00:45:56,317 --> 00:45:59,616
I wonder what's gonna happen
to me when I get there?

403
00:46:04,425 --> 00:46:07,929
Yuji? What are you doing up?

404
00:46:07,929 --> 00:46:10,231
I can't fall sleep.

405
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,291
You'll need your rest.
Tomorrow is gonna be tough.

406
00:46:18,439 --> 00:46:21,375
If you're out here, the mission
briefing must be finished.

407
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:23,878
If it's not too much trouble,

408
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:25,947
do you mind filling
me in on the details?

409
00:46:25,947 --> 00:46:30,318
An advance party will move in first,
attack the Blue, and smoke them out.

410
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,887
And then the next team moves in.

411
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:36,390
Their job is to debug the system
and get the automatons back on line.

412
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,626
Once that's done,
we'll move on to the shuttle.

413
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:41,295
That's our mission.

414
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:45,233
That's it? It sounds
like suicide to me!

415
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:47,969
As long as there is even
a slight chance of success,

416
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:50,371
we do as we're ordered.

417
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,931
That's what a soldier does, okay?

418
00:47:00,314 --> 00:47:05,547
Yuji, our future depends on tomorrow.

419
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:26,073
Marlene.

420
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:27,802
Yeah, what is it?

421
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:31,512
Is there anything I
can do to help out?

422
00:47:31,512 --> 00:47:33,014
No, we're okay here.

423
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:34,982
There's got to be
something I can do!

424
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:36,643
Let me help!

425
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,454
Listen, why don't you
just try and relax?

426
00:47:40,454 --> 00:47:43,925
The journey here took a lot out
of both of us, but we made it.

427
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:45,993
And now everything is under control.

428
00:47:45,993 --> 00:47:48,062
You're the reason
we're doing this Yuji.

429
00:47:48,062 --> 00:47:50,531
This mission is all about you.

430
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:52,897
All units prepare for departure!

431
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,672
Here! Take this with you.

432
00:48:03,511 --> 00:48:07,014
Before I went into sleep treatment,
a friend of mine gave it to me.

433
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:09,346
He said this would
bring me good luck.

434
00:48:12,453 --> 00:48:15,022
I know it seems silly,
but take it with you anyway.

435
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:17,124
It's given me good luck so far,

436
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:19,456
so maybe it will do
the same for you!

437
00:48:22,296 --> 00:48:25,959
No you should keep it,
maybe it's only good luck for you.

438
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:32,006
I'll see you when I get back.

439
00:48:32,006 --> 00:48:33,837
Marlene...

440
00:48:35,276 --> 00:48:38,846
Take care, and
please come back...

441
00:48:38,846 --> 00:48:39,613
Alive...

442
00:48:39,613 --> 00:48:41,482
Decoy One, I'll blast the Blue's Nest.

443
00:48:41,482 --> 00:48:44,952
Decoy Two, you take the point
and keep an eye out for any attackers.

444
00:48:44,952 --> 00:48:46,613
Copy. Decoy One out!

445
00:48:48,356 --> 00:48:50,458
The advance team is nearing
the fourth barracks.

446
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,824
They're about to
commence the attack.

447
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:06,540
First strike complete!
Get out of there!

448
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,542
The Blue are coming out
of the 4th barracks.

449
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,544
They're in pursuit!

450
00:49:10,544 --> 00:49:14,415
They will be within the attackers
effective perimeter in 90 seconds!

451
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:16,917
Decoy One, we're going
to begin our advance.

452
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:19,477
I want you to stand by in Sector 2.

453
00:49:25,493 --> 00:49:26,560
Here they come!

454
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,154
The automatons are
nearing the perimeter!

455
00:49:35,469 --> 00:49:37,371
The invasion route is clear!

456
00:49:37,371 --> 00:49:38,929
Move out!

457
00:50:03,531 --> 00:50:05,733
I expected to find the
power here operational,

458
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:07,601
but this is almost
too good to be true.

459
00:50:07,601 --> 00:50:10,331
This should make it easier
to gain access to the shuttle!

460
00:50:11,005 --> 00:50:12,506
Commander! Look!

461
00:50:12,506 --> 00:50:13,874
Watch yourselves!

462
00:50:13,874 --> 00:50:16,510
Those things are still programmed
for regular operations.

463
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,978
They will shoot to kill!

464
00:50:17,978 --> 00:50:20,714
Unauthorized personnel are
not permitted in this area.

465
00:50:20,714 --> 00:50:21,949
Withdraw immediately.

466
00:50:21,949 --> 00:50:23,818
If you do not comply
with these instructions,

467
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:26,719
you will be forcibly
removed from this base.

468
00:50:29,156 --> 00:50:31,725
Withdraw immediately. Withdraw...

469
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:32,692
Fire!

470
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:36,931
Han, get the control
system back on line

471
00:50:36,931 --> 00:50:38,365
and run a diagnostic check!

472
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:41,469
After that, I want you to
debug those automatons!

473
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:42,834
Yes sir!

474
00:50:49,276 --> 00:50:51,278
Can't you go any faster?

475
00:50:51,278 --> 00:50:54,782
Back off. What I'm trying
to do is way over your head.

476
00:50:54,782 --> 00:50:56,283
So get lost!

477
00:50:56,283 --> 00:50:57,284
Hey? What?

478
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,553
I thought I told you
to stay out of the way kid!

479
00:50:59,553 --> 00:51:02,156
Now let Han do his job!

480
00:51:02,156 --> 00:51:04,725
Listen if you really want to
help your girlfriend out there

481
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:08,456
then keep your mouth shut and
maybe you might learn a thing or two.

482
00:51:22,443 --> 00:51:25,279
Okay! The automatons
have been debugged.

483
00:51:25,279 --> 00:51:29,116
All right! Let's prep the
shuttle for lift-off operations!

484
00:51:29,116 --> 00:51:30,879
Thank god.

485
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:37,352
Okay! Let's finish these guys off!

486
00:51:40,628 --> 00:51:42,696
Recall the advance
divisions to the shuttle!

487
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:45,096
They should be about done out there.

488
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:52,262
Let's pick up the pace a little!
Huh? What's that?!

489
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,635
Hit the emergency power!

490
00:51:57,511 --> 00:52:00,748
Malfunction! Aw, dammit!

491
00:52:00,748 --> 00:52:03,317
Base electrical supply
down 60 percent.

492
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:06,153
Launch procedures must be aborted!

493
00:52:06,153 --> 00:52:08,289
That's impossible!

494
00:52:08,289 --> 00:52:09,924
Huh?! What?

495
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:11,659
I'm detecting some
underground bionoise!

496
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,627
It's moving slow,
but it's getting closer!

497
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:15,595
There's a lot of them!

498
00:52:22,002 --> 00:52:23,470
Evacuation code confirmed!

499
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,270
All units assume defensive positions
and return to base immediately!

500
00:52:41,622 --> 00:52:45,422
That's strange, why would they
all of a sudden stop like that?

501
00:52:46,927 --> 00:52:48,724
Something's wrong.

502
00:52:56,337 --> 00:52:59,607
We got a large group of Blue
900 meters from the base perimeter!

503
00:52:59,607 --> 00:53:02,710
Then order the advance team
to move in and eliminate them!

504
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:03,544
It's no use!

505
00:53:03,544 --> 00:53:05,446
There are too many of them
and they've got us surrounded!

506
00:53:05,446 --> 00:53:09,149
If we make one wrong move,
we could lead a whole horde of Blue

507
00:53:09,149 --> 00:53:11,208
right into the launch center!

508
00:53:11,685 --> 00:53:14,745
So what you're saying is the advance
team is on its own out there?

509
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:17,825
Dammit! There's too many of them!

510
00:53:17,825 --> 00:53:19,690
Where the hell did they come from?

511
00:53:22,162 --> 00:53:24,999
All right soldiers!
We're launching the shuttle!

512
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:28,093
Switch to manual control
and start the countdown!

513
00:53:29,036 --> 00:53:32,606
Wait! You can't do that!
The advance team is still out there!

514
00:53:32,606 --> 00:53:34,041
We'll have to abandon them!

515
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,776
What'd you say?

516
00:53:35,776 --> 00:53:38,245
We have to lift off
before the Blue get here!

517
00:53:38,245 --> 00:53:40,681
It's unfortunate,
but we have to do it!

518
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,275
I'm sorry there's no other way.

519
00:53:44,518 --> 00:53:46,315
Minh! What's wrong!

520
00:53:48,455 --> 00:53:51,091
It's too dangerous to try a
shuttle launch right now sir.

521
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:53,160
I think it would be safer
to secure a defensive line

522
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,329
against the Blue
and hold our ground.

523
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:57,431
Listen! I give the
orders around here!

524
00:53:57,431 --> 00:53:59,667
You just get that shuttle ready!
Understand?

525
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,801
Stay here!

526
00:54:00,801 --> 00:54:02,936
I'm gonna go out there
and help them!

527
00:54:02,936 --> 00:54:04,571
No you're not!

528
00:54:04,571 --> 00:54:05,739
Let's make a deal!

529
00:54:05,739 --> 00:54:10,577
- I'll stop the incoming Blue, and you
wait for the advance team to come back.
- Do you think I'm a fool?

530
00:54:10,577 --> 00:54:12,546
In the first place,
you're a Sleeper!

531
00:54:12,546 --> 00:54:14,581
Secondly, you might
think you can fight,

532
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:17,051
but you have no idea what
you'll be up against out there!

533
00:54:17,051 --> 00:54:18,819
So you stay right by my side!

534
00:54:18,819 --> 00:54:21,622
Your little taste of combat
is nothing compared to this!

535
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:23,424
You let the professionals
handle this one!

536
00:54:23,424 --> 00:54:27,451
I want you to sit tight
and do exactly what I say! Got it?

537
00:54:35,102 --> 00:54:39,340
Now you listen to me old man!
You can't tell me what to do!

538
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,975
You got it?
I'm not going to Second Earth

539
00:54:41,975 --> 00:54:44,845
just so you can claim me
as some kind of prize!

540
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:45,946
I'm going for Marlene!

541
00:54:45,946 --> 00:54:49,650
You might think she's expendable,
but I sure don't!

542
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,552
Sleeper! Go!

543
00:54:51,552 --> 00:54:53,821
There's an Armor Shrike
loaded on the trailer.

544
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,323
Go get the Blue!

545
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:58,525
Move! Now's your opportunity,

546
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:00,828
but remember you've
only got five minutes!

547
00:55:00,828 --> 00:55:04,764
Damn you Han!
Disobeying orders is a serious offense!

548
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:11,071
I believe giving irrational orders
is also a serious offense.

549
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:13,407
I'm not trying to undermine
your authority sir,

550
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:16,543
but our first priority should be to
keep the Blue away from the shuttle.

551
00:55:16,543 --> 00:55:20,080
When the advance team returns,
we'll be able to safely blast off.

552
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,416
Very well, but when
we get to Second Earth

553
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:25,719
there's going to be a court martial!
I guarantee it!

554
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:27,448
If we get there, that is.

555
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:36,219
Go to hell!

556
00:55:49,743 --> 00:55:52,041
Get off of me,
you insect bastard!

557
00:56:02,356 --> 00:56:05,223
Decoy One! Can you hear me?

558
00:56:06,527 --> 00:56:09,830
I'm gonna take out as many of these
oversized cockroaches as I can!

559
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:11,598
This is your chance
to get to the shuttle!

560
00:56:11,598 --> 00:56:12,533
Now get out of here!

561
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:13,967
The shuttle!

562
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:15,502
Scott! Hang on!

563
00:56:15,502 --> 00:56:18,801
Please god,
don't let this be in vain!

564
00:56:32,152 --> 00:56:33,320
No, it can't be!

565
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,083
Marlene...

566
00:56:37,057 --> 00:56:39,958
Where are you?
Why won't you respond?

567
00:56:52,606 --> 00:56:55,008
What? Look at the
size of that thing.

568
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:57,943
I've never seen a
Blue that big before!

569
00:57:00,447 --> 00:57:02,210
Oh god!

570
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:04,117
D'you see that?

571
00:57:04,117 --> 00:57:05,486
It's huge!

572
00:57:05,486 --> 00:57:06,919
All right!

573
00:57:12,693 --> 00:57:14,820
Yeah, come on!

574
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:20,701
The shuttle is ready sir!

575
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:22,936
Should I initiate
the launch sequence?

576
00:57:22,936 --> 00:57:26,607
No! Not yet! We take off
when I give the order soldier!

577
00:57:26,607 --> 00:57:30,441
We can't leave until we get
that Sleeper on board!

578
00:58:40,147 --> 00:58:43,884
I guess, you saved
my life again huh?

579
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:49,322
Like I told you, no matter what happens
I'm taking you into space with me!

580
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:56,730
You did good out there, kid!

581
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:59,665
Once we get to Second Earth
I'll buy you a drink!

582
00:59:21,588 --> 00:59:24,458
This is the commander of
the European recovery squad.

583
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:26,660
We are en route from
Baikonur launch site.

584
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,831
On board are the surviving members
of my team and one Sleeper.

585
00:59:30,831 --> 00:59:34,267
E.T.A. to Second Earth Space Station
is approximately ten minutes.

586
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:37,498
Request a medical team
upon our arrival. Over!

587
00:59:43,644 --> 00:59:45,312
Yuji...

588
00:59:45,312 --> 00:59:47,246
Look at the Earth.

589
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:53,654
I'm here...

590
00:59:53,654 --> 00:59:58,592
I'm actually in outer space.
How strange.

591
00:59:58,592 --> 01:00:03,363
You know if I hadn't gotten sick,
I would never have seen this view.

592
01:00:03,363 --> 01:00:05,593
Um, Marlene!

593
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,226
Please take this,
I want you to have it now.

594
01:00:11,038 --> 01:00:15,609
Maybe it will remind you of
the time we spent together.

595
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:17,210
Please take it.

596
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:19,880
I won't be fighting anymore
so I want you to have it.

597
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,507
Okay?

598
01:01:18,271 --> 01:01:19,795
Yuji...

599
01:01:22,008 --> 01:01:22,809
Yuji...

600
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:24,444
Marlene...

601
01:01:24,444 --> 01:01:27,675
Are you okay?

602
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:33,684
No!

603
01:01:56,343 --> 01:01:57,711
Please save him!

604
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:59,872
Please...

605
01:02:01,381 --> 01:02:03,212
Yuji...

606
01:03:23,196 --> 01:03:26,222
Time has passed by so quickly.

607
01:03:29,803 --> 01:03:33,569
It's been two months since we
arrived here on Second Earth.

608
01:03:35,642 --> 01:03:40,011
During that time they've kept a
close eye on everything I've done.

609
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:55,662
Maybe I deserve all
this surveillance.

610
01:03:55,662 --> 01:03:58,598
After all a Sleeper was injured
because I let my guard down.

611
01:03:58,598 --> 01:04:00,934
And I haven't seen Yuji since then.

612
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:03,169
I mean, I haven't been
allowed to see him.

613
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:07,207
I have no idea what condition he's in.
I was brought before a court martial,

614
01:04:07,207 --> 01:04:09,576
and my movement on the base
has been tightly restricted.

615
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:14,347
My military career is worthless,
and now I'm back where I started.

616
01:04:14,347 --> 01:04:16,583
In order to maintain my rank,

617
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:21,054
I've been required to go through
an intensive retraining program.

618
01:04:21,054 --> 01:04:23,456
All personnel! Saddle up!

619
01:04:23,456 --> 01:04:24,324
Unfortunately,

620
01:04:24,324 --> 01:04:26,860
the poor results of my most
recent battle excercise

621
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:31,854
gave them the excuse they needed to
suspend my Special A pilot certification.

622
01:04:46,046 --> 01:04:49,516
Marlene Angel!
Your responses are way too slow!

623
01:04:49,516 --> 01:04:52,953
Why did you hesitate? Take the
shot when it presents itself.

624
01:04:52,953 --> 01:04:54,554
If you would have fired
through the groundling

625
01:04:54,554 --> 01:04:58,491
in front of the Blue's core
you would have hit your target.

626
01:04:58,491 --> 01:04:59,960
Decide what's more important,

627
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,451
the groundlings or the
success of your mission!

628
01:05:14,808 --> 01:05:16,810
It doesn't seem to
matter to my superiors

629
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,109
that on my last tour of
Earth I went through hell.

630
01:05:21,648 --> 01:05:23,917
I can't get Yuji
out of my mind.

631
01:05:23,917 --> 01:05:26,219
I wonder where he is,

632
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:27,721
what he's doing.

633
01:05:27,721 --> 01:05:30,123
I wish I could talk to him,

634
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:32,819
just one more time.

635
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,344
Look at that.

636
01:05:51,344 --> 01:05:54,147
It's like it's trying to fuse
completely with the body!

637
01:05:54,147 --> 01:05:56,809
It's evolution has accelerated!

638
01:06:56,242 --> 01:06:57,444
Professor Miyagi,

639
01:06:57,444 --> 01:06:59,245
we've transferred the
Sleeper you requested

640
01:06:59,245 --> 01:07:01,648
out of the intensive care unit.

641
01:07:01,648 --> 01:07:04,017
And that would be the sample
that unexpectedly woke up

642
01:07:04,017 --> 01:07:05,919
in his sleep capsule
back on Earth?

643
01:07:05,919 --> 01:07:07,587
That's correct sir!

644
01:07:07,587 --> 01:07:09,155
Put him in the regulation room.

645
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:11,191
I'll go get the data
for the new Armor Shrike.

646
01:07:11,191 --> 01:07:12,692
Yes sir!

647
01:07:12,692 --> 01:07:15,495
For your sake, you had
better not fail me.

648
01:07:15,495 --> 01:07:17,292
Sleeper...

649
01:07:41,888 --> 01:07:46,459
Earth, it looks so
beautiful from here.

650
01:07:46,459 --> 01:07:49,562
I wonder if they'll ever
let me go back there again,

651
01:07:49,562 --> 01:07:53,191
or if I'll be spending the
rest of my days in this place.

652
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:59,572
It doesn't seem like this good
luck charm has any left in it for me.

653
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:02,905
I should have never
taken it from him!

654
01:08:09,816 --> 01:08:12,919
There's no problem here.
I'll return to my station.

655
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:15,717
Hear me? I'll return to my station!

656
01:08:19,492 --> 01:08:22,695
No! Don't leave me in here!
The room is full of them!

657
01:08:22,695 --> 01:08:24,964
Let me out! Please let me out!

658
01:08:24,964 --> 01:08:27,767
Uh! The bugs are everywhere!
Get them away from me!

659
01:08:27,767 --> 01:08:29,792
They're going to get me!

660
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:33,173
Doctor, a problem sir!

661
01:08:33,173 --> 01:08:36,409
One of the Sleepers tried to commit
suicide by chewing through his wrists,

662
01:08:36,409 --> 01:08:38,244
so we put him in lockdown.

663
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:40,940
I think you should take a
look inside the room sir?

664
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:54,027
Gentlemen, I assure you this
new technology will work!

665
01:08:54,027 --> 01:08:56,896
And what happens if it doesn't, Miyagi?

666
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:59,499
You expect us to believe
that this Sleeper Brigade

667
01:08:59,499 --> 01:09:02,869
will give us the military advantage
we need to defeat the Blue?

668
01:09:02,869 --> 01:09:04,704
We're running out of options.

669
01:09:04,704 --> 01:09:07,874
We all know our current
military force is dwindling,

670
01:09:07,874 --> 01:09:10,210
and the Blue have
gained the upper hand.

671
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:13,112
And a full scale nuclear
attack is out of the question.

672
01:09:13,112 --> 01:09:17,217
That would leave the Earth
uninhabitable for centuries.

673
01:09:17,217 --> 01:09:19,485
I know a way that we
can win this war,

674
01:09:19,485 --> 01:09:23,289
a way to use those suffering
from the prophecy syndrome

675
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:24,924
to help us take back our planet.

676
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:27,449
I've prepared this demonstration.

677
01:09:28,361 --> 01:09:32,432
This is the modified Armor Shrike
developed exclusively for Sleeper use.

678
01:09:32,432 --> 01:09:35,301
The Mega-blade is synchronized
with the pilot's nervous system.

679
01:09:35,301 --> 01:09:37,303
Interpreting the
Sleeper's thought patterns.

680
01:09:37,303 --> 01:09:39,872
The prophecy syndrome is
a result of the B cells

681
01:09:39,872 --> 01:09:41,407
that inhabit a Sleeper's body.

682
01:09:41,407 --> 01:09:44,811
These cells act like antibodies
when the host comes under attack,

683
01:09:44,811 --> 01:09:47,213
destroying the perceived threat.

684
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:50,450
Right! That's interesting but
there's still no way of knowing

685
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:53,286
how effective these Sleepers
will be on the battlefield!

686
01:09:53,286 --> 01:09:55,388
By harnessing the
Sleeper's nervous system

687
01:09:55,388 --> 01:09:59,225
to the Armor Shrike we have the ability
to activate the B cells at any time.

688
01:09:59,225 --> 01:10:01,761
This will increase the subject's
perception and reflexes

689
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:05,231
and cause them to focus their
rage on our enemy, the Blue.

690
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:07,767
It's a perfect union
between man and machine,

691
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:10,069
and with it we can not lose!

692
01:10:10,069 --> 01:10:13,172
You must never forget the
humiliation the Blue have caused us!

693
01:10:13,172 --> 01:10:16,442
They have destroyed our homes
and taken everything from us!

694
01:10:16,442 --> 01:10:20,246
Even as I speak, those disgusting
creatures are moving across the Earth.

695
01:10:20,246 --> 01:10:22,081
I've heard some of you
in the barracks say

696
01:10:22,081 --> 01:10:24,317
those things are demons
that crawled out of hell!

697
01:10:24,317 --> 01:10:25,985
Well, you're wrong!

698
01:10:25,985 --> 01:10:27,720
They're nothing more than insects!

699
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:29,989
Insects that must be exterminated!

700
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:32,492
And this battle will
make those pests realize

701
01:10:32,492 --> 01:10:35,061
once and for all that
we are the superior species!

702
01:10:35,061 --> 01:10:37,864
We will take control of
the Earth once again!

703
01:10:37,864 --> 01:10:38,965
Onward fighters!

704
01:10:38,965 --> 01:10:42,402
- Don't stop until you have eradicated
every last Blue from our planet!
- Alpha 1, launch.

705
01:10:42,402 --> 01:10:44,597
That is your mission!

706
01:10:49,175 --> 01:10:51,644
The fate of humanity is in your hands!

707
01:10:51,644 --> 01:10:54,613
Glory goes with you!
Death to the Blue!

708
01:11:33,252 --> 01:11:35,988
Alpha 2, you are clear
to go for launch.

709
01:11:35,988 --> 01:11:38,825
Zaire! Tanzania! Gambia!

710
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:42,522
Landing operations are
proceeding as scheduled!

711
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:46,966
Control! This is the
Nest Demolition Corps.

712
01:11:46,966 --> 01:11:49,135
We are 8000 meters
from the Nest entrance.

713
01:11:49,135 --> 01:11:51,270
We are under attack
by a new type of Blue!

714
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:52,972
Request immediate reinforcements!

715
01:11:52,972 --> 01:11:54,439
Move out!

716
01:12:01,647 --> 01:12:04,817
Dammit! It's like
a maze in here!

717
01:12:04,817 --> 01:12:06,785
Where the hell are
those reinforcements?

718
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:10,757
What's wrong?

719
01:12:10,757 --> 01:12:13,326
There's a great deal of
bionoise ahead but uh...

720
01:12:13,326 --> 01:12:14,227
What is it?

721
01:12:14,227 --> 01:12:16,028
Well, everything is still.

722
01:12:16,028 --> 01:12:19,165
I'm not reading any
motion on the scanner.

723
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:21,725
All right then, proceed slowly.

724
01:12:29,142 --> 01:12:30,977
Holy shit!

725
01:12:30,977 --> 01:12:33,312
Are those eggs?

726
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:35,448
What the hell?

727
01:12:35,448 --> 01:12:39,919
Yeah, I think so.

728
01:12:39,919 --> 01:12:43,156
You know, if this is the
Blues' spawning ground,

729
01:12:43,156 --> 01:12:46,751
then I bet that the queen
must be around here somewhere!

730
01:13:14,654 --> 01:13:15,814
I've lost an engine!

731
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:50,389
I guess you win.

732
01:13:50,389 --> 01:13:52,220
Come on, do it!

733
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:40,273
Uh, wait!

734
01:14:40,273 --> 01:14:42,708
This is Rick Ferguson of
the reconnaissance patrols,

735
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:43,809
somebody come in please!

736
01:14:43,809 --> 01:14:44,810
Can you hear me!

737
01:14:44,810 --> 01:14:46,646
Yes, its Marlene Angel!

738
01:14:46,646 --> 01:14:50,616
There was some intense somatic magnetism
making communication impossible!

739
01:14:50,616 --> 01:14:51,851
Are you all right?

740
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:53,085
Yeah.

741
01:14:53,085 --> 01:14:55,154
Look, I've set a bomb in
the Blue's spawning ground.

742
01:14:55,154 --> 01:14:56,689
I'll meet you out front okay?

743
01:14:56,689 --> 01:14:58,452
Okay.

744
01:15:24,784 --> 01:15:27,954
I guess we got lucky.
Looks like we won this one.

745
01:15:27,954 --> 01:15:30,990
I'm The Rick. I was
in the Nest with you.

746
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:34,060
Rick, have you ever
seen an Armor Shrike

747
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,461
with a Mega-blade attachment?

748
01:15:35,461 --> 01:15:37,986
No, is it some kind of prototype?

749
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:39,966
I don't know.

750
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:43,736
If you ask me, it sounds like somebody's
been doing their own modifications.

751
01:15:43,736 --> 01:15:47,695
Hey! Enough shop talk!
You free tonight?

752
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:53,613
I don't think so!

753
01:15:53,613 --> 01:15:57,811
That was no ordinary soldier
inside that Armor Shrike.

754
01:15:59,118 --> 01:16:02,455
A group of Blue have escaped into the
jungle from the demolished nest sight.

755
01:16:02,455 --> 01:16:07,859
All units maintain your positions
and if you make contact fire at will!

756
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:16,569
It's so quiet.

757
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:19,470
It's as if there's no
life left in this jungle.

758
01:16:31,317 --> 01:16:32,151
The Blue!

759
01:16:32,151 --> 01:16:33,352
Huh?

760
01:16:33,352 --> 01:16:35,684
What are children doing way out here?

761
01:16:44,964 --> 01:16:46,488
Wait.

762
01:16:49,869 --> 01:16:53,236
Stay in your Shrike!
We're on a mission remember?

763
01:16:57,243 --> 01:17:00,440
Don't worry, I'm a friend.

764
01:17:02,848 --> 01:17:04,679
Don't be afraid.

765
01:17:09,955 --> 01:17:11,824
Are there any others here?

766
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:14,884
If there are, can you tell
me where they're at?

767
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:19,461
I see.

768
01:17:24,904 --> 01:17:26,496
Here they come!

769
01:18:06,879 --> 01:18:09,848
Hold your fire there
are humans out there!

770
01:18:12,084 --> 01:18:13,786
You hold your fire!

771
01:18:13,786 --> 01:18:15,947
What's wrong?
Can't you hear me?

772
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,859
They're everywhere!

773
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:22,261
What's wrong with you?

774
01:18:22,261 --> 01:18:22,895
Stop it!

775
01:18:22,895 --> 01:18:26,031
You bastard!
What? Are going to kill me too!

776
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:28,761
Stand down! What is your problem?

777
01:19:20,853 --> 01:19:23,048
I'm unstoppable!

778
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,101
Yuji!

779
01:19:36,101 --> 01:19:37,970
My god, Yuji!

780
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:41,140
Have you forgotten me? It's Marlene!

781
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:43,108
Marlene?

782
01:19:43,108 --> 01:19:46,271
It's me! Answer me Yuji!

783
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:50,540
Yuji!

784
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:53,619
We're nearly at
the drop off point.

785
01:19:53,619 --> 01:19:58,022
All pilots set your Armor Shrikes
to camouflage mode for urban warfare.

786
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:28,420
Upon completion of this
mission in the American district,

787
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:30,589
this division will be
returning to Second Earth.

788
01:20:30,589 --> 01:20:34,727
In other words,
this will be your last fight!

789
01:20:34,727 --> 01:20:38,964
Your job is to demolish the
largest nest in North America!

790
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:41,797
Do it! Destroy the Blue!

791
01:21:16,902 --> 01:21:20,030
My god! Is that the Sleeper brigade?

792
01:21:42,795 --> 01:21:44,997
The Sleepers have really
turned this war around!

793
01:21:44,997 --> 01:21:47,066
Yes! Nothing can stop us now!

794
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:49,668
Soon we'll all be able
to return to Earth!

795
01:21:49,668 --> 01:21:52,671
And a dark chapter of our
history will soon be over!

796
01:21:52,671 --> 01:21:56,342
Yes, it's all played out
just as I predicted.

797
01:21:56,342 --> 01:21:58,978
We've taken the Earth
back from the Blue.

798
01:21:58,978 --> 01:22:01,280
But what difference will it make?

799
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:07,810
As far as I'm concerned mankind deserves
to stay in this giant coffin in space.

800
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:17,791
Where the hell are they?

801
01:22:29,708 --> 01:22:31,573
Hang on, I'm coming!

802
01:22:51,597 --> 01:22:53,497
Yuji...

803
01:23:21,727 --> 01:23:24,029
Yuji!

804
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:26,832
You, you're Yuji Kaido right?

805
01:23:26,832 --> 01:23:28,867
Answer me! You know me!

806
01:23:28,867 --> 01:23:31,703
It's Marlene Angel!

807
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:33,694
Marlene?

808
01:24:18,484 --> 01:24:20,452
The Earth...

809
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:23,154
The Earth is infested.

810
01:24:26,225 --> 01:24:28,227
Humans are the same as the Blue.

811
01:24:28,227 --> 01:24:31,763
They're both cancers that
are eating away this planet!

812
01:24:31,763 --> 01:24:34,466
What the hell happened to
you on Second Earth Yuji?

813
01:24:34,466 --> 01:24:37,503
What did they do to you
to make you act so insane?

814
01:24:37,503 --> 01:24:39,037
Please tell me!

815
01:24:39,037 --> 01:24:41,267
If there's any way
I can help you, I will!

816
01:24:43,775 --> 01:24:48,109
Humans, the Blue...
They are both the enemy!

817
01:25:21,013 --> 01:25:25,184
Come on, don't just sit there!
Hurry up and kill them, dammit!

818
01:25:25,184 --> 01:25:26,718
Oh my god!

819
01:25:26,718 --> 01:25:30,484
There's too many of them!
They're gonna kill us all! No!

820
01:25:56,882 --> 01:25:58,816
What's that?

821
01:26:04,823 --> 01:26:06,688
Yuji...

822
01:26:17,002 --> 01:26:22,133
That's it, come and get
me you insect bastards!

823
01:26:44,630 --> 01:26:47,622
I hope this still has
some luck left in it.

824
01:27:06,184 --> 01:27:10,814
I'm the only one who can
rid the world of its cancer!

825
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,760
Remember Yuji...
Please remember...

826
01:29:31,229 --> 01:29:32,958
Yuji!

827
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,968
Remember!

828
01:29:36,968 --> 01:29:39,562
Yuji!

829
01:29:45,844 --> 01:29:47,971
Marlene...

830
01:30:00,559 --> 01:30:02,127
Yuji...

831
01:30:02,127 --> 01:30:05,297
Can you hear me Yuji?
It's me, it's Marlene.

832
01:30:05,297 --> 01:30:07,399
Do you remember?

833
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:09,299
Yuji...

834
01:30:36,495 --> 01:30:39,020
Please don't leave me here.

835
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,400
Stay with me Yuji...

836
01:30:46,371 --> 01:30:50,705
Please don't go Yuji.
I need you.

837
01:31:04,623 --> 01:31:07,325
I knew all along that
the prophecy syndrome

838
01:31:07,325 --> 01:31:10,595
was capable of stimulating
the Sleepers battle instincts,

839
01:31:10,595 --> 01:31:12,564
but I refused to accept the fact

840
01:31:12,564 --> 01:31:14,900
that it would cause them
to breakdown mentally.

841
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:17,836
I can't ignore it anymore.

842
01:31:17,836 --> 01:31:21,239
I'm responsible for
all this suffering.

843
01:31:21,239 --> 01:31:25,232
I'm no better than a mother
who abandons a child in need.

844
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:27,129
The Blue?!

845
01:32:40,819 --> 01:32:43,355
I'm sorry Yuji.

846
01:32:43,355 --> 01:32:46,483
I won't be able to
save you this time.

847
01:32:48,426 --> 01:32:50,189
Please forgive me.

848
01:32:52,097 --> 01:32:55,692
Yuji... Yuji...

849
01:33:57,796 --> 01:34:02,028
What? The Blue...
They're gone.

850
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:14,103
Thank you, Marlene...

851
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:45,077
Seeking out a single ray of light

852
01:34:45,077 --> 01:34:54,153
All I can do is wander on, no matter
how far, through the darkness

853
01:34:54,153 --> 01:35:06,463
Clinging to a heart that is
governed by sorrow, and yet

854
01:35:07,666 --> 01:35:15,007
As I breathe a sigh not unlike surrender

855
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:24,350
I don't want to fear
being hurt, all the time

856
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:26,685
Set me free now

857
01:35:26,685 --> 01:35:33,025
Come on, let it all go,
to the far reaches of time,

858
01:35:33,025 --> 01:35:38,864
From that which binds the soul

859
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:41,100
For my heartbeat

860
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:47,439
Make freedom your weapon,
and you are sure to attain it

861
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:53,546
The power to believe and dream is there

862
01:35:53,546 --> 01:35:58,245
For you to go on living

863
01:36:02,721 --> 01:36:10,729
From deep within your heart, you try
to call out, but the cry reaches no one

864
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:17,236
You have to keep on putting it into words

865
01:36:17,236 --> 01:36:29,615
These chains that we call fate
bind us hand and foot, while you

866
01:36:30,816 --> 01:36:37,990
Vaguely lament over the
weaknesses you have now

867
01:36:37,990 --> 01:36:47,433
But unless you try to become strong,
you'll never change

868
01:36:47,433 --> 01:36:49,702
Set you free now

869
01:36:49,702 --> 01:36:55,874
Come on, let it all go,
while your heartbeat runs hot,

870
01:36:55,874 --> 01:37:01,880
From everything that stands in your way

871
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,049
For your heartbeat

872
01:37:04,049 --> 01:37:10,556
Even more than memories,
the future brightly shines,

873
01:37:10,556 --> 01:37:21,057
To reunite you with the one
you love more than any other

874
01:37:33,012 --> 01:37:39,184
Come on, let it all go,
to the far reaches of time,

875
01:37:39,184 --> 01:37:45,190
From that which binds the soul

876
01:37:45,190 --> 01:37:47,359
For my heartbeat

877
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:53,699
Make freedom your weapon,
and you are sure to attain it

878
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:59,872
The power to believe and dream is there

879
01:37:59,872 --> 01:38:04,741
For you to go on living

880
01:38:08,714 --> 01:38:11,274
Set me free now
