1
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:13,060
You keep your work station
so clean, Jerome.

2
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:15,999
It's next to godliness.

3
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,461
- Isn't that what they say?
- "Godliness."

4
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:24,061
I reviewed your flight plan.
Not one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:27,431
Phenomenal. It's right that
someone like you...

6
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,187
is taking us to Titan.

7
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:32,158
Has the committee
approved the mission?

8
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,923
There's been talk of delay.

9
00:05:33,992 --> 00:05:36,294
You shouldn't listen to talk.

10
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,749
You leave in a week.

11
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:41,409
You've got a substance test.

12
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
If you have been notified
for substance analysis...

13
00:06:13,512 --> 00:06:15,552
please report
to the testing center.

14
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,375
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.

15
00:06:28,072 --> 00:06:30,690
A beautiful piece of equipment there, Jerome.
Have I ever told you that?

16
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,321
Only every time I'm in here.

17
00:06:33,064 --> 00:06:35,104
Occupational hazard.

18
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:37,729
I see a great many
of the course of any given day.

19
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,004
Yours just happens to be
an exceptional example.

20
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,485
I don't know why my folks
didn't order one like that for me.

21
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,640
By the way...

22
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,079
have I ever told you about my son?

23
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:06,112
- No, you haven't.
- Remind me to sometime.

24
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:10,752
So you're about to go up.

25
00:07:10,824 --> 00:07:13,126
One week left.

26
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:15,047
Please tell me
you're at least a bit excited.

27
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,542
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

28
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,279
Congratulations, Jerome.

29
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,211
Thank you.

30
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:44,292
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

31
00:07:46,472 --> 00:07:48,327
Sometimes more.

32
00:07:49,544 --> 00:07:51,878
You're the only one
who watches every one of them.

33
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,939
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

34
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:04,319
The most unremarkable of events.

35
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,879
Jerome Morrow,
navigator first class...

36
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:11,522
is about to embark on a one-year
manned mission to Titan...

37
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,534
the 14th moon of Saturn.

38
00:08:15,112 --> 00:08:17,446
A highly prestigious assignment.
Although for Jerome...

39
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,861
selection was
virtually guaranteed at birth.

40
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:25,317
He's blessed with all the gifts
required for such an undertaking.

41
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,773
A genetic quotient
second to none.

42
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,101
No, there is truly
nothing remarkable...

43
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:33,183
about the progress
of Jerome Morrow.

44
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:37,282
Except that
I am NOT Jerome Morrow.

45
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,545
I was conceived
in the Riviera.

46
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:51,911
Not the French Riviera,
the Detroit variety.

47
00:08:54,312 --> 00:08:56,733
They used to say that
a child conceived in love...

48
00:08:56,808 --> 00:08:58,848
has a greater chance of happiness.

49
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,800
They don't say that anymore.

50
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:07,357
I'll never understand what possessed
my mother to put her faith...

51
00:09:07,432 --> 00:09:10,367
in God's hands rather than
those of her local geneticist.

52
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,711
Ten fingers, ten toes.
That's all that used to matter.

53
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:20,224
Not now.
Now, only seconds old...

54
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:24,158
the exact time and cause
of my death was already known.

55
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:31,938
Neurological condition:
60% probability.

56
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:34,495
Manic depression:
42% probability.

57
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:38,310
Attention deficit disorder:
89% probability.

58
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,303
Heart disorder--

59
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,390
99% probability.

60
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,319
Early fatal potential.

61
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:48,384
Life expectancy: 30.2 years.

62
00:09:49,928 --> 00:09:51,783
Thirty years.

63
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,103
The name for the certificate?

64
00:09:54,272 --> 00:09:56,193
- Anton.
- No!

65
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,118
Vincent Anton.

66
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:03,013
Yeah. That's a good name.

67
00:10:05,992 --> 00:10:07,847
I know he'll do something.

68
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:18,589
From an early age I came to think
of myself as others thought of me.

69
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,479
Chronically ill.
Every skinned knee and runny nose...

70
00:10:21,544 --> 00:10:23,780
was treated
as if it were life-threatening.

71
00:10:23,848 --> 00:10:26,269
I'm sorry.
The insurance won't cover it.

72
00:10:26,344 --> 00:10:28,384
- If he fell--
- But I was told, that everything--

73
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:30,911
I really wish there was
something I could do.

74
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:41,832
Like most other parents of their day...

75
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:44,765
they were determined that their next child
would be brought into the world...

76
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,557
in what has become
the natural way.

77
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:52,545
Your extracted eggs, Marie...

78
00:10:52,616 --> 00:10:57,537
have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

79
00:10:57,608 --> 00:11:01,056
After screening, we are
left, as you see, with two healthy boys...

80
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:03,201
and two very healthy girls.

81
00:11:03,272 --> 00:11:07,396
Naturally, no critical predispositions
to any major inheritable diseases.

82
00:11:07,464 --> 00:11:10,464
All that remains is to select
the most compatible candidate.

83
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,036
First, we let's decide on gender.
Have you given it any thought?

84
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,178
We would want Vincent
to have a brother, you know...

85
00:11:18,248 --> 00:11:20,158
to play with.

86
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,344
Of course you would.
Hello, Vincent.

87
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:28,391
You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and fair skin.

88
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:33,285
I've taken the liberty of eradicating
any potentially prejudicial conditions.

89
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,425
Premature baldness, myopia...

90
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:37,765
alcoholism and
addictive susceptibility...

91
00:11:37,832 --> 00:11:39,719
propensity for violence,
obesity, etc.

92
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:43,362
We didn't want--
I mean diseases, yes, but--

93
00:11:43,432 --> 00:11:48,003
Right! We were just wondering if...
If it's good to just leave a few things to chance?

94
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:51,301
You want to give your child
the best possible start.

95
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:53,789
Believe me, we have enough
imperfection built in already.

96
00:11:53,864 --> 00:11:57,509
Your child doesn't need
any additional burdens.

97
00:11:57,576 --> 00:11:59,747
Keep in mind
this child is still you.

98
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,987
Simply the best of you.

99
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:06,373
You could conceive naturally a thousand
times and never get such a result.

100
00:12:09,064 --> 00:12:12,097
That's how my brother, Anton,
came into the world.

101
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:15,136
A son my father considered
worthy of his name.

102
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:30,948
What did I tell you?
See how he's grown?

103
00:12:45,736 --> 00:12:47,874
By the time we were
playing at blood brothers...

104
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:51,937
I understood that there was something
very different flowing through my veins...

105
00:12:52,008 --> 00:12:54,310
and I'd need
more than a drop...

106
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,231
if I was going to get anywhere.

107
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,269
Our favorite game was chicken.

108
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:22,565
When our parents weren't watching,
we used to swim as far out as we dared.

109
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:26,112
It was about who would get scared
and turn back first.

110
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,343
Come on, you coward!

111
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:47,294
Of course,
it was always me.

112
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,789
Anton was by far
the stronger swimmer...

113
00:13:49,864 --> 00:13:51,937
and he had no excuse
to fail.

114
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:02,787
Maybe it was the love of the planets...

115
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:05,704
maybe it was just my growing dislike for this one.

116
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:09,630
But for as long as I can remember,
I have dreamed of going into space.

117
00:14:09,704 --> 00:14:13,926
700 million. 750 million.
800 million.

118
00:14:13,992 --> 00:14:15,585
850 million.

119
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,308
How many astronauts are there anyway?

120
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:22,500
I bet I could be one.
If I wanted.

121
00:14:22,568 --> 00:14:24,935
Hey, don't eat that.
It's Pluto.

122
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,853
My goals didn't change a lot
in the intervening years...

123
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,324
Vincent...

124
00:14:32,424 --> 00:14:34,700
much to my parents' dismay.

125
00:14:35,479 --> 00:14:35,968
Vincent...

126
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:46,594
You have to be realistic.
With a heart condition like yours--

127
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:50,461
Mom, there's a chance
there's nothing even wrong with my heart.

128
00:14:50,536 --> 00:14:51,648
One chance in a hundred.

129
00:14:53,608 --> 00:14:56,161
- I'll take it, all right?
- The trouble is, they won't.

130
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:58,980
Listen. For God's sake...

131
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:00,903
you gotta understand something.

132
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:10,653
The only way that you'll see the inside
of a spaceship is if you will cleaning it.

133
00:15:11,688 --> 00:15:13,444
My father was right.

134
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:16,097
It didn't matter how much
I lied on my resume.

135
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:18,983
My real resume
was in my cells.

136
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:22,212
Why should anybody invest
all that money to train me...

137
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,557
when there are a thousand other
applicants with a far cleaner profile?

138
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:29,087
Of course, it's illegal
to discriminate.

139
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,265
"Genoism" it's called.

140
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:34,020
But no one
takes the law seriously.

141
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,728
If you refuse to disclose...

142
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:46,916
they can always take a sample
from a door handle or a handshake...

143
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:49,853
even the saliva
on your application form.

144
00:15:51,272 --> 00:15:54,785
If in doubt, a legal drug test
can just as easily become...

145
00:15:54,856 --> 00:15:57,954
an illegal peek
at your future in the company.

146
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:09,572
You sure you wanna do this?
You know you're gonna lose.

147
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,244
It was the last time
we swam together...

148
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,254
and out into the open sea...

149
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:27,176
like always, knowing each stroke
to the horizon...

150
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,055
was one we'd have to
make back to the shore.

151
00:16:42,728 --> 00:16:45,892
But something was very different
about that day.

152
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,935
Every time Anton
tried to pull away...

153
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,179
he found me right beside him.

154
00:16:53,672 --> 00:16:56,574
Until finally,
the impossible happened.

155
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Vincent!

156
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,500
Vincent!

157
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,834
It was the one moment
in our lives that my brother...

158
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:20,995
was not as strong as he believed
and I was not as weak.

159
00:17:21,064 --> 00:17:23,933
It was the moment that made
everything else possible.

160
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,189
Like many others in my situation...

161
00:18:08,264 --> 00:18:11,526
I moved around a lot in the next few years,
getting work where I could.

162
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,328
I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.

163
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,623
I belonged to a new underclass...

164
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:22,111
no longer determined
by social status of the color of your skin.

165
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,607
- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- No.

166
00:18:25,672 --> 00:18:28,738
We now have discrimination
down to a science.

167
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:30,946
All right!
There's your cleaning material.

168
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,382
Start from the front,
clean all the way back.

169
00:18:34,536 --> 00:18:38,311
And I wanna see my smiling face
on that floor.

170
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,694
What about you, Your Majesty?
You dreaming of space?

171
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,030
Come here.

172
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,782
You can start by
cleaning this space right here.

173
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:06,366
I was never more certain of
how far away I was from my goal...

174
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,578
than when I was
standing right beside it.

175
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:20,295
When you clean the glass, Vincent,
don't clean it too well.

176
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,083
What do you mean?

177
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:24,519
You might get ideas.

178
00:20:24,584 --> 00:20:28,414
Yeah, but if the glass is clean, it'll be easier
for you to see me when I'm on the other side of it.

179
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,630
For all my brave talk,
I knew it was just that.

180
00:21:21,704 --> 00:21:24,486
No matter how much I trained
or how much I studied...

181
00:21:24,552 --> 00:21:28,709
the best test score in the world wasn't going
matter without the blood test to go with it.

182
00:21:30,408 --> 00:21:34,118
I made up my mind to resort
to more extreme measures.

183
00:21:34,184 --> 00:21:36,322
The man who
showed up at my doorstep...

184
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:39,043
didn't exactly advertise
in the Yellow Pages.

185
00:21:39,112 --> 00:21:40,967
Stand straight.

186
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,055
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

187
00:21:46,376 --> 00:21:50,151
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birthmarks?

188
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:53,031
No. I don't think so.

189
00:21:54,504 --> 00:21:57,919
You're serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

190
00:21:57,992 --> 00:22:00,326
No, I'd give 100%.

191
00:22:01,448 --> 00:22:04,383
That'll get you halfway there.

192
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:08,482
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

193
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,175
By heart, huh?

194
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:15,463
You realize the commitment
is binding.

195
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,087
You have somebody in mind?

196
00:22:38,696 --> 00:22:42,656
For the genetically superior,
success is easier to attain...

197
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:44,616
but is by no means guaranteed.

198
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,706
After all, there is no gene for fate.

199
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:50,980
And when,
for one reason or another...

200
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:53,917
a member of the elite
falls on hard times...

201
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:58,465
their genetic identity becomes a
valued commodity for the unscrupulous.

202
00:22:58,536 --> 00:23:01,089
One man's loss is another man's gain.

203
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,047
His credentials are impeccable.

204
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:05,054
An expiration date
you wouldn't believe.

205
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:12,641
The guy's practically
gonna live forever.

206
00:23:12,712 --> 00:23:15,395
He's got an I.Q. off the register.

207
00:23:15,464 --> 00:23:18,082
Better than 20/20 in both eyes.

208
00:23:18,152 --> 00:23:21,087
And the heart of an ox.
He could run through a wall.

209
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:28,102
If he could still run.

210
00:23:29,928 --> 00:23:33,790
Actually, he was
a big-time swimming star.

211
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:39,232
You could go anywhere with this guy's
helix tucked under your arm.

212
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:47,137
What did I tell you? You look so right
together I wanna double my fee.

213
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,597
- We don't look anything alike.
- It's close enough.

214
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:51,876
When was the last time anybody
looked at a photograph?

215
00:23:51,944 --> 00:23:54,694
You could have my face on your name tag,
for Christ's sake.

216
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,859
- How do I explain the accident?
- That's the beautiful thing.

217
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,164
It happened out of the country.

218
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:03,549
There's no record he ever broke his back.
As far as anyone's concerned...

219
00:24:03,624 --> 00:24:07,007
he's still a walking, talking,
fully-productive member of society.

220
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,244
You just have to get him clean
and fill in the last year of his life.

221
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:12,708
You're a foreigner.

222
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:15,558
They don't care
where you were born, just how.

223
00:24:15,624 --> 00:24:18,341
Blood has no nationality.

224
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,797
As long as it's got
what they're looking for...

225
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:22,846
it's the only passport you need.

226
00:24:23,688 --> 00:24:25,063
Who lives up there?

227
00:24:26,504 --> 00:24:28,359
Well, I certainly don't.

228
00:24:30,632 --> 00:24:33,927
So began the process
of becoming Jerome.

229
00:24:33,992 --> 00:24:38,368
Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.

230
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,328
Isn't there another way?

231
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:43,174
Surgery's no good.
They'll see the scars.

232
00:24:44,136 --> 00:24:45,991
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

233
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:50,914
Besides, the color doesn't match.

234
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:53,853
He's right.
My eyes are prettier.

235
00:24:57,256 --> 00:25:00,038
You understand
I take 25% of everything you make.

236
00:25:00,104 --> 00:25:05,189
If for some reason it doesn't work out, all this
equipment must be returned within seven days.

237
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:07,427
And you don't get your deposit back.

238
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:10,495
- Wait, wait! I thought you said 20%.
- He told me 20%.

239
00:25:10,568 --> 00:25:12,478
- Twenty percent.
- It's not negotiable.

240
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:28,381
I guess that's it.

241
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,338
Not quite.

242
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:33,125
- Why? What?
- There's still the matter of the height.

243
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,294
- Why, how tall are you?
- 4'6".

244
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,269
How tall were you
before the accident?

245
00:25:38,344 --> 00:25:41,410
Unfortunately,
his profile says he's 6'1".

246
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,157
So I'll wear lifts.

247
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:48,093
Even with lifts,
you're not that tall.

248
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,487
So, what?

249
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,800
No... no...

250
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:05,279
No, we never discussed that.

251
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,239
I thought you were serious, Vincent.

252
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:09,573
I am serious. I'm not doing that.

253
00:26:15,464 --> 00:26:16,412
I won't do that.

254
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:25,349
Jerome never
questioned my commitment again.

255
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:28,285
I took my mind off the pain
by reminding myself...

256
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,957
that when I eventually did stand up
I'd be exactly two inches closer to the stars.

257
00:26:34,024 --> 00:26:36,358
You all right?

258
00:26:36,424 --> 00:26:38,278
Yeah.

259
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,527
You wanna go dancing?

260
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,593
You had to be a right-hander.

261
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:49,282
I guess no one orders
southpaws anymore.

262
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,654
Jerome Morrow.

263
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,718
It's a nice name.

264
00:26:57,832 --> 00:27:01,127
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

265
00:27:01,192 --> 00:27:03,493
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

266
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:14,599
Look at this.

267
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:17,798
Look at it.

268
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,391
It's nice.

269
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:23,302
Impressed. Is it real?

270
00:27:24,104 --> 00:27:26,625
Are you colorblind too, Vincent?

271
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:28,321
- It's silver.
- So?

272
00:27:28,392 --> 00:27:32,287
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

273
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,719
With all I had going for me...

274
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,503
I was still second best.

275
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:42,631
Me.

276
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:46,144
So how do you expect
to pull this off?

277
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:50,182
I don't know exactly.

278
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,319
Your signature needs work.

279
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:01,443
It soon came time to put
our preparations to the test.

280
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:05,123
Jerome had been engineered with everything
he needed to get into Gattaca...

281
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:08,040
except the desire to do so.

282
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:09,959
Do you really wanna be in there?

283
00:28:10,024 --> 00:28:13,286
I don't wanna be in there.
I wanna be up there.

284
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,453
What's up there?

285
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,655
That's what I wanna find out, Jerome.

286
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,815
Call me Eugene.

287
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:26,631
My middle name.

288
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,728
If you're gonna be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

289
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:42,561
I gotta get going.
Where's my sample?

290
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:44,607
In the refrigerator!
Door on the left!

291
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:47,781
Which pouch?

292
00:28:47,848 --> 00:28:49,408
Oh, any of them.

293
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,215
Should I test it?

294
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,095
If you like!

295
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:07,168
- What's wrong with the machine?
- Nothing!

296
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,280
It's a hot sample.
You've been drinking again.

297
00:29:09,352 --> 00:29:12,701
- I haven't!
- Oh Christ, Eugene, it's 8:00 in the morning!

298
00:29:12,776 --> 00:29:14,238
I haven't!

299
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:23,904
This is no joke!
My interview is in an hour!

300
00:29:30,024 --> 00:29:33,286
There is more vodka in this piss
than there is piss!

301
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:37,094
I'm sorry.
I had half a glass to celebrate, I'm sorry.

302
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,877
Try Friday's.
That one will be okay.

303
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,260
- There's only Wednesday left.
- Wednesay... That's the one.

304
00:29:55,208 --> 00:29:58,142
Listen. It's not too late
to back out.

305
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:05,189
This is the last day that you're gonna be you
and I'm gonna be me.

306
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:10,628
Well?

307
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:39,973
Congratulations.

308
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,422
Well, what about the interview?

309
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:46,790
That was it.

310
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:55,776
I got it.

311
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,495
Of course you got it.

312
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,910
And that's the way it was.

313
00:31:10,984 --> 00:31:15,718
Each day, I would dispose of as much loose skin,
fingernails and hair as possible...

314
00:31:15,784 --> 00:31:20,770
to limit how much of my In-Valid self
I would leave in the Valid world.

315
00:31:27,016 --> 00:31:31,271
At the same time, Eugene prepared samples of
his own superior body matter...

316
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:33,224
so that I might pass for him.

317
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:36,550
Customized urine pouches
for the frequent substance tests...

318
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:40,391
fingertip blood sachets
for security checks...

319
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:43,041
and vials filled with other traces.

320
00:31:44,008 --> 00:31:47,237
While Eugene supplied me
with a new identity, I paid the rent...

321
00:31:47,304 --> 00:31:50,566
and kept him in the style
to which he'd become accustomed.

322
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:55,231
Eugene never suffered from the routine
discrimination of a "utero"...

323
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:58,206
a "faith birth" or "In-Valid"
as we were called.

324
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,397
A "Valid," a "vitro," a "made man",
he suffered under a different burden.

325
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,025
The burden of perfection.

326
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,251
I was now a member
of a relatively new...

327
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,582
and particularly detested
segment of society.

328
00:32:12,648 --> 00:32:16,128
One of those who refuses
to play the hand that he was dealt.

329
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,056
I am most commonly known
as a "borrowed ladder" or...

330
00:32:21,128 --> 00:32:23,877
a "de-gene-erate."

331
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:30,468
In the guise of Jerome Morrow...

332
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:33,154
I have risen quickly
through the ranks of Gattaca.

333
00:32:33,224 --> 00:32:35,591
Only one of the mission directors
has ever come close...

334
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:38,340
to discovering my true identity.

335
00:32:38,408 --> 00:32:41,953
Strange to think, he may have more
success exposing me in death...

336
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:44,741
than he ever did in life.

337
00:32:56,328 --> 00:32:58,500
We apologize for any inconvenience.

338
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:08,994
- Well, I think we can rule out suicide.
- Excuse me, Sir?

339
00:33:09,064 --> 00:33:10,918
Nothing.

340
00:33:11,911 --> 00:33:13,254
Thank you.

341
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,489
This will take a while.
We might have to push things back.

342
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:37,025
Irene, I want you to
assist the investigators.

343
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:39,038
My work, Director.
That would put me behind.

344
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:41,554
I appreciate your sacrifice, Irene.

345
00:33:43,176 --> 00:33:45,445
Will you see that
I don't lose my place in line?

346
00:33:45,512 --> 00:33:47,846
Your place is assured.

347
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:50,301
So, will you kindly inform
the authorities...

348
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,540
that we will cooperate
in any way...

349
00:33:53,608 --> 00:33:56,837
although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

350
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,879
- Director--
- Thank you, Irene.

351
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:00,577
Thank you, Director.

352
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:06,278
Director, how will this affect the mission?

353
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,344
Oh, we're still going ahead
as planned.

354
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:12,133
The launch window's only open
until week's end...

355
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,942
and tragic though
this event may be...

356
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:19,969
it hasn't stopped
the planets' turning, has it?

357
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:32,864
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

358
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:34,463
When?

359
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:36,502
End of the week.

360
00:34:37,502 --> 00:34:38,500
End of the week?

361
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:40,000
That soon?

362
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:43,587
What about the mission director?

363
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:46,621
He's dead.

364
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,887
Are you serious?

365
00:34:51,592 --> 00:34:56,294
They found him in his office this morning
beaten so badly they had to check his name tag.

366
00:34:57,992 --> 00:35:00,294
You are serious.

367
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,375
So that's it.

368
00:35:01,448 --> 00:35:04,546
There's nothing between us
and ignition.

369
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,930
I'm going up.

370
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,893
- The man was murdered.
- So? I didn't do it.

371
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:16,099
I didn't say you did, but if the man was murdered
the place is gonna be crawling with Hoovers.

372
00:35:16,168 --> 00:35:19,648
I'll take my chances with the
"J. Edgars" over the mission director.

373
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,292
Besides, what if they do find something?
I'll gonna be slightly out of their jurisdiction.

374
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:31,903
We have to get drunk immediately.

375
00:35:39,112 --> 00:35:41,633
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, I hope our table's ready.

376
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:44,606
- I understand you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.
- Yeah, looks that way.

377
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,201
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

378
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:50,621
- Of course, sir.
- Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

379
00:35:50,696 --> 00:35:51,775
Thank you, sir.

380
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,585
How old?

381
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:17,510
- Me?
- The specimen.

382
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:20,390
I kissed him five minutes ago.
A real good one.

383
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,942
I'll see what I can do.

384
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:30,367
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

385
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,455
Thank you.

386
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,881
Good luck.

387
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:47,427
Some samples may be consumed
in the sequencing process.

388
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:53,437
9.3. Quite a catch.

389
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:58,179
Yes. Quite a catch.

390
00:37:23,304 --> 00:37:26,119
God, how many times
have I told Cavendish?

391
00:37:26,184 --> 00:37:29,348
This can't have been opened
more than five minutes ago!

392
00:37:29,416 --> 00:37:32,002
A wine like this needs to breathe.
Remember that.

393
00:37:32,072 --> 00:37:34,560
You know, they say
when you're weightless...

394
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:38,562
it's the closest thing
to being in the womb.

395
00:37:41,864 --> 00:37:44,547
I can't believe
you pulled this off.

396
00:37:44,616 --> 00:37:46,983
They're sending you up there.

397
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:49,437
Up there, for Christ's sake.
You, of all people.

398
00:37:49,512 --> 00:37:51,716
I hate to think of you
alone in that room for a year.

399
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:53,857
Don't think about it.
Anyway...

400
00:37:53,928 --> 00:37:56,612
the room I'm stuck in
is bigger than your tin can.

401
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,851
You know what I'm saying.
What are you gonna do?

402
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,496
I have my books.
I go places in my head.

403
00:38:03,816 --> 00:38:06,205
- I'd be happier if you had company.
- I have visitors!

404
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,892
- Yeah, well. None that you don't pay.
- I wouldn't have it any other way.

405
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,440
Seriously,
what are you gonna do?

406
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:17,471
I'm gonna finish this.

407
00:38:29,896 --> 00:38:31,838
What's Titan like
this time of year?

408
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,802
What's Titan like?

409
00:38:36,872 --> 00:38:39,425
Titan is exactly like this.

410
00:38:51,144 --> 00:38:52,999
All the time.

411
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:57,123
It's got a cloud around it so thick
nobody can tell what's underneath.

412
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,815
Maybe there's nothing there.

413
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,976
There's something there.

414
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:09,223
You should be going
instead of me.

415
00:39:11,464 --> 00:39:12,708
Why is that?

416
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,132
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

417
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,775
I'm scared of heights.

418
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,535
I'm sorry!

419
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:51,206
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

420
00:40:00,328 --> 00:40:03,110
- I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.
- You're not that sorry.

421
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,168
I'm really, really sorry.

422
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:11,485
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

423
00:40:14,152 --> 00:40:15,843
Come on!

424
00:40:15,912 --> 00:40:18,301
- I'm sorry.
- Help!

425
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,094
And I wasn't drunk.

426
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,902
- What do you mean "you're not drunk"?
- When I walked in front of that car.

427
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,201
What car?

428
00:40:35,272 --> 00:40:37,476
I stepped right out
in front of it.

429
00:40:38,984 --> 00:40:41,089
I'd never been more sober
in my life.

430
00:40:43,976 --> 00:40:46,659
- Go to sleep.
- Couldn't even get that right, could I?

431
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:52,319
"If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again."

432
00:40:52,392 --> 00:40:54,246
Go to sleep.

433
00:40:59,336 --> 00:41:01,191
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

434
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,549
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

435
00:41:46,472 --> 00:41:48,643
- How much do you need?
- Twenty minutes.

436
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:11,623
You can go.

437
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:19,367
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

438
00:42:42,984 --> 00:42:47,840
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

439
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,887
Every ten years or so,
things go our way.

440
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,349
The eyelash?
What do you know about him?

441
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:54,464
He's an unregistered In-Valid.

442
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:57,831
He was a janitor here until a few years back
when he disappeared out of sight.

443
00:42:57,896 --> 00:43:00,067
So the specimen could have
been here since then.

444
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:03,780
Well, take a look at the floor. So I don't think
anything lays around here for very long.

445
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,000
It's also the matter of motive.

446
00:43:05,069 --> 00:43:08,289
 Is a janitor gonna come back here after all
this time to kill a man he never knew?

447
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,727
Well, his profile does suggest
a violent temperament.

448
00:43:11,192 --> 00:43:15,102
If I'm not mistaken, his profile also
suggests he's a sick man.

449
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:18,885
There's a 90% chance the owner of this eyelash
has already died himself of natural causes.

450
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,851
Then there's a ten percent chance he's still alive.

451
00:43:20,851 --> 00:43:22,749
It's a lost-and-found case, sir.

452
00:43:22,824 --> 00:43:26,272
All we have to do is find the man who's minus an eyelash,
we have the murderer.

453
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:28,383
I'll do a cross check,
find out about his family...

454
00:43:28,456 --> 00:43:31,904
I've already run it. There's no record
of any living relative.

455
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,350
Well, that's a damn shame, sir.

456
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:37,060
I want you to check the entry log,
alibis, grudges.

457
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,983
I look around,
I see a lot of dry eyes.

458
00:43:39,048 --> 00:43:42,790
The mission director
was not, uh, universally loved.

459
00:43:43,656 --> 00:43:45,631
He was leading the cutbacks
in the program.

460
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:48,487
With all due respect, sir...

461
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:53,726
Whatever you say.

462
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:12,232
Jerome, Jerome,
the metronome.

463
00:44:12,296 --> 00:44:14,401
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

464
00:44:16,744 --> 00:44:20,039
Mr. Director, you will be pleased
to know that we have a suspect.

465
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,143
That is a relief.
Who is it?

466
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:26,821
We found an unaccounted for specimen
in the south wing and here's his picture.

467
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:31,843
- An In-Valid.
- We are still following other leads.

468
00:44:31,912 --> 00:44:35,393
Be that as it may,
I'm having this posted immediately.

469
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,325
I'm curious, Director.

470
00:44:37,256 --> 00:44:42,013
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

471
00:44:42,088 --> 00:44:44,575
Your hiring practices.

472
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:47,070
Our recruitment philosophy.

473
00:44:47,144 --> 00:44:49,216
Who do you have to be
to be here?

474
00:44:49,288 --> 00:44:53,663
Naturally, our standard is beyond
that of the common citizen.

475
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:56,867
Even amongst your people, you must
have varying levels of excellence.

476
00:44:56,936 --> 00:45:01,311
Occasionally we've been forced to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings...

477
00:45:01,384 --> 00:45:04,679
but nothing that would prohibit
someone from working in a field...

478
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:08,060
such as law enforcement,
for example.

479
00:45:08,136 --> 00:45:11,846
But now there are enough
of the right kind of people...

480
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,595
to warrant a new measuring stick.

481
00:45:14,664 --> 00:45:16,606
Bodies with minds to match.

482
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,470
Essential as we push out further
and further.

483
00:45:21,544 --> 00:45:23,551
Yet you still
closely monitor performance.

484
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:26,722
We have to ensure that people
are meeting their potential.

485
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,443
- And exceeding it.
- No one exceeds his potential.

486
00:45:29,512 --> 00:45:30,592
If he did?

487
00:45:30,664 --> 00:45:34,308
It would simply mean we did not
accurately gauge his potential in the first place.

488
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,127
- Are you all right, Jerome?
- Terrific.

489
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,809
This is the entry log
for the last seven days.

490
00:46:19,016 --> 00:46:20,423
What about you, Irene?

491
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,660
Do you have an alibi?

492
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:26,943
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

493
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:29,027
Excuse me.

494
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:39,871
I'll take care of that for you, Mr. Morrow.

495
00:46:53,768 --> 00:46:57,412
I see I'm not the only one
who looks up every time there's a launch.

496
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,368
- Hello, Jerome.
- Hello.

497
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,422
It's awful about the director.

498
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,463
Awful it didn't happen sooner.

499
00:47:08,296 --> 00:47:11,525
Didn't the director threaten to cancel
your mission more than once, Jerome?

500
00:47:11,592 --> 00:47:14,374
- Yes. He did.
- Somebody did you a favor.

501
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,579
Do they have any idea whose hand
I should be shaking?

502
00:47:16,648 --> 00:47:19,015
They found an eyelash
in the south wing.

503
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,797
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

504
00:47:24,297 --> 00:47:24,872
Jerome...

505
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:31,741
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

506
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:34,781
I'm sorry.

507
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,581
Seems you're
everything they say you are and more.

508
00:47:43,336 --> 00:47:47,230
What about you, Irene? You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

509
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:49,374
Not quite like the rest of us.

510
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:53,346
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart failure."

511
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:55,391
I think that's what the manual says.

512
00:47:55,464 --> 00:48:00,068
The only trip I'll take in space
is around the sun on the satellite right here.

513
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:04,802
Well, if there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I'm standing.

514
00:48:09,128 --> 00:48:10,983
If you don't believe me...

515
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,061
Here. Take it.

516
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:27,137
If you're still interested,
let me know.

517
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,571
I'm sorry.
The wind caught it.

518
00:49:08,044 --> 00:49:13,057
Jerome, is this the approach path
that we discussed?

519
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:17,537
Absolutely, Director.

520
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:21,222
Quite right. Quite right.

521
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,255
Listen to what I'm saying to you.

522
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,458
I want what I ordered.

523
00:49:40,488 --> 00:49:43,009
It's a completely different color.

524
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,284
Now, I'm bored of talking to you.

525
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,523
I'm bored.
I'll call you back.

526
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:52,061
That was the company
that sent us your hair dye.

527
00:49:52,136 --> 00:49:54,951
They sent me "summer wheat"
instead of "honey dawn."

528
00:49:55,016 --> 00:49:57,252
Any fool knows
it's two shades lighter.

529
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,027
She said.
"Why don't you try a change?"

530
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,255
I don't want a change.
We can't use a change.

531
00:50:02,568 --> 00:50:05,951
Now I'm probably gonna have to pay
for the five boxes they've sent me.

532
00:50:06,024 --> 00:50:07,398
We can't stay here.

533
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:09,766
Idiots I have to deal with,
you wouldn't believe.

534
00:50:09,832 --> 00:50:12,134
They think I killed
the mission director.

535
00:50:14,152 --> 00:50:18,276
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

536
00:50:20,324 --> 00:50:22,852
- Where?
- In the corridor.

537
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,986
Oh well, it could be worse.
They could've found it in your eye.

538
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,478
They've got my picture
plastered up all over the place.

539
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,876
I can't turn around
without seeing my own face.

540
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:36,647
- They'll recognize me.
- They won't recognize you.

541
00:50:36,712 --> 00:50:40,007
I don't recognize you!
They won't marry the eyelash to you.

542
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,439
They won't believe
that one of their elite...

543
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:44,708
could have suckered them
all this time.

544
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:46,947
No, no, no.
We change nothing.

545
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:48,423
We do as we planned.

546
00:50:48,488 --> 00:50:50,910
You're Jerome Morrow.
Navigator first class.

547
00:50:50,984 --> 00:50:53,285
I'm not Jerome Morrow.

548
00:50:53,352 --> 00:50:55,391
I'm a murder suspect.

549
00:50:55,464 --> 00:50:56,733
What are you doing?

550
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,807
What are you doing!
That's more than a day's work!

551
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,400
- Wait.
- We can't stay here.

552
00:51:02,472 --> 00:51:04,327
Stop that!

553
00:51:04,392 --> 00:51:06,432
Oh, fine!
Fine!

554
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:09,597
You leave if you want,
but you're not taking that stuff.

555
00:51:09,668 --> 00:51:12,423
That stuff is mine!

556
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:17,000
I could've rented myself out
to somebody with a spine...

557
00:51:17,064 --> 00:51:20,926
if I'd known you were going to go
belly-up on me at the last fucking gasp.

558
00:51:21,896 --> 00:51:24,099
You can't quit on me now.

559
00:51:24,168 --> 00:51:27,813
I've put too much into this.
What do you want me to do?

560
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,695
Wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

561
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,691
Eugene, they're going to find me.

562
00:51:36,808 --> 00:51:38,662
You still don't understand, do you?

563
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,695
When they look at you, they don't
see you anymore. They only see me.

564
00:51:59,944 --> 00:52:02,758
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

565
00:52:04,648 --> 00:52:06,982
How could you be so careless?

566
00:52:38,408 --> 00:52:40,164
I'm going out.

567
00:52:40,232 --> 00:52:42,174
Where are you going?

568
00:52:42,248 --> 00:52:45,379
If I'm gonna get arrested tomorrow,
I'm gonna go out tonight.

569
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:50,592
- You sure that's a good idea to go out?
- Well, it was your idea not to change anything.

570
00:52:50,664 --> 00:52:53,512
- Who's going?
- Just everybody.

571
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:56,285
Everybody.

572
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,694
If I don't go,
it'll look suspicious.

573
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,757
You don't want
to look suspicious, do you?

574
00:53:07,336 --> 00:53:08,897
Thanks.

575
00:54:06,056 --> 00:54:07,943
Who ordered this?

576
00:54:08,008 --> 00:54:10,179
What are we doing here?

577
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:11,265
I'm following a lead.

578
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:15,137
Forgive me, sir, but that's what I do.
I'm a detective. I follow leads.

579
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:18,241
What makes you think
the owner of the eyelash is here?

580
00:54:18,312 --> 00:54:22,174
He's an In-Valid, sir. Where do we look
for In-Valids but where In-Valids are?

581
00:54:22,248 --> 00:54:23,939
He's an In-Valid?

582
00:54:25,416 --> 00:54:28,929
He's an In-Valid clever enough
to go unregistered all these years.

583
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,520
Do you think he's likely
to lie down for us now?

584
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:34,210
- Well, what would you suggest, sir?
- Move the inquiry...

585
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,654
back to the scene.

586
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,687
Draw a five-mile radius around Gattaca,
sweep again, random stops.

587
00:55:00,424 --> 00:55:03,271
You're a navigator?
At Gattaca?

588
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:05,409
That's what it says, doesn't it?

589
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,935
It doesn't say you're crippled.

590
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:11,395
I'm not crippled.

591
00:55:11,464 --> 00:55:14,246
I hurt my leg training, you moron.

592
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:17,127
How dare you question me?

593
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:18,501
Yeah, right.

594
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:21,568
- What's your number?
- All right, forget it.

595
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:24,128
What's your number,
you fucking flatfoot?

596
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,720
I said forget it.
What do you want, an apology?

597
00:55:26,792 --> 00:55:28,287
It gets to you, doesn't it?

598
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,208
It gets to you that I can do
what you can only dream of!

599
00:55:31,272 --> 00:55:35,265
I'm getting off this ball of dirt!
How dare you question me?

600
00:55:35,336 --> 00:55:37,986
- That's harassment.
- My mistake.

601
00:55:38,056 --> 00:55:40,911
What's your number?
What's your number!

602
00:55:42,344 --> 00:55:45,126
May I remind you
that this is a crime scene?

603
00:55:45,192 --> 00:55:47,166
What's this man doing here?

604
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,015
- What are you doing, old man?
- Uh, doing my job, sir.

605
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:55,559
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

606
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:48,135
You didn't know?

607
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,134
- Oh, yes. Yeah.
- Wonderful. Wasn't it?

608
00:56:52,904 --> 00:56:55,587
Twelve fingers or one,
it's how you play.

609
00:56:56,776 --> 00:56:59,591
That piece can only
be played with 12.

610
00:57:16,616 --> 00:57:18,471
What's all this about?

611
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:22,086
Uh, it's probably nothing.

612
00:57:58,344 --> 00:58:01,606
You better not. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen.

613
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:04,551
Get my meaning?

614
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:34,177
Thanks.

615
00:58:34,248 --> 00:58:37,063
You never know
where those swabs have been.

616
00:58:38,888 --> 00:58:41,376
I want to show you something.

617
00:59:25,544 --> 00:59:27,518
Come on!
We'll miss it!

618
00:59:54,312 --> 00:59:56,951
Come on. Come on.
We'll miss it, come on.

619
01:00:41,864 --> 01:00:43,719
What did I tell you?

620
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:05,790
- Strange.
- What?

621
01:01:05,864 --> 01:01:09,639
- Your eyes look different.
- I guess it must be the light.

622
01:01:11,112 --> 01:01:12,486
Must be.

623
01:01:33,768 --> 01:01:35,841
Positive match.

624
01:01:35,912 --> 01:01:37,439
I'm impressed.

625
01:01:38,664 --> 01:01:41,053
The cup was definitely used
since the original sweep?

626
01:01:41,992 --> 01:01:43,847
Two samples. Two days.

627
01:01:43,912 --> 01:01:46,820
Either the suspect went back to the scene
of the crime to get a drink of water,

628
01:01:46,842 --> 01:01:50,017
or I don't know anybody that thirsty
or he still works there.

629
01:01:50,088 --> 01:01:52,739
I thought we checked
all the service staff.

630
01:01:52,808 --> 01:01:54,980
I don't think he cleans up
the place anymore.

631
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:58,179
I have a feeling he might be there under false
pretenses. Playing somebody else's hand.

632
01:01:58,248 --> 01:02:01,564
A borrowed ladder?
At Gattaca?

633
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:04,674
It's far-fetched,
but it's not a ruled out possibilty.

634
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:07,777
I find it hard to believe
he could be one of their elite workers.

635
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:09,277
Even if he got pass the security system,

636
01:02:09,348 --> 01:02:11,577
he wouldn't have the mental faculty
or the physical stamina.

637
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,999
Maybe you're underestimating him.

638
01:02:13,064 --> 01:02:16,098
Maybe he is an impostor,
and maybe the director found out about it.

639
01:02:16,168 --> 01:02:20,641
That could be his motive. I say, we sample every
employee within the parameters intravenously.

640
01:02:20,712 --> 01:02:23,526
Two-thirds of their work force
fall under that category.

641
01:02:23,592 --> 01:02:27,388
We would closing them down for days.
No. A fingertip sample or urine should be sufficient.

642
01:02:27,464 --> 01:02:32,199
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

643
01:02:59,176 --> 01:03:02,754
It's only a matter of time, sir.
Only a matter of time.

644
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,324
What's with the plungers, Lamar?

645
01:03:10,952 --> 01:03:12,807
You open up a blood bank?

646
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:16,484
The gentlemen of law enforcement
are concerned...

647
01:03:16,552 --> 01:03:20,229
that my testing methods
may have been compromised.

648
01:03:32,104 --> 01:03:34,373
- Goddamn!
- Jerome, I'm sorry.

649
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:36,960
- Are you out of practice, Lamar?
- Here, let me look at that.

650
01:03:37,032 --> 01:03:39,406
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

651
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:42,530
Luckily, it looks as though
we have enough.

652
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,015
If you need more,
you can always get it off his shoes.

653
01:04:01,215 --> 01:04:02,015
Irene

654
01:04:06,344 --> 01:04:08,199
So you didn't do it, after all.

655
01:04:08,472 --> 01:04:12,327
Oh no, I...
I guess somebody beat me to it.

656
01:04:12,392 --> 01:04:13,919
I guess.

657
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,519
Um...

658
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:22,081
I leave in two days.

659
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,298
I guess you know that.

660
01:04:27,368 --> 01:04:28,743
But...

661
01:04:41,096 --> 01:04:42,885
That's the last.

662
01:04:43,976 --> 01:04:47,140
- Something's not right.
- He's not here. It's a blind alley.

663
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:50,557
No, we missed something.
I say we test again.

664
01:04:50,632 --> 01:04:54,659
Test? I cannot allow you
to disrupt operations any further.

665
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:57,477
You're not at all concerned about having
a murderer in your midst?

666
01:04:57,544 --> 01:05:00,860
Right now your presence
is creating more of a threat.

667
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:03,783
The window for our latest launch
is open for seven days...

668
01:05:03,848 --> 01:05:05,703
once every 70 years...

669
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,940
so it's rather crucial
we leave on time.

670
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:11,650
The mission means a great deal
to you, doesn't it?

671
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,103
And your late colleague
opposed it, didn't he?

672
01:05:15,176 --> 01:05:18,023
Take another look
at my profile, Detective.

673
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:20,936
You won't find a violent bone
in my body.

674
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:24,349
My apologies, Director.
We won't trouble you any further.

675
01:05:26,056 --> 01:05:28,871
This is not the only place
we can look.

676
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:30,936
OK

677
01:05:32,936 --> 01:05:35,456
Let's start making our rounds.

678
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:38,436
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

679
01:06:40,807 --> 01:06:43,045
- I know something about that.
- You, Jerome?

680
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,502
What heart problem
did you ever have?

681
01:06:46,568 --> 01:06:48,575
Did you get yours broken once?

682
01:06:53,352 --> 01:06:55,239
I had this crazy idea...

683
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:59,397
that you were more interested
in the murder case than me.

684
01:07:00,136 --> 01:07:01,510
You're right.

685
01:07:04,744 --> 01:07:06,370
That's a crazy idea.

686
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,294
Would you like to dance?

687
01:07:47,624 --> 01:07:49,314
It's funny.

688
01:07:49,384 --> 01:07:50,813
You work so hard...

689
01:07:50,888 --> 01:07:54,533
and you do everything you can
to get away from a place...

690
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,415
and when you finally
get your chance to leave...

691
01:07:58,696 --> 01:08:00,736
you find a reason to stay.

692
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,256
A year is a long time.

693
01:08:09,864 --> 01:08:13,693
Not so long.
Just once around the sun.

694
01:08:22,632 --> 01:08:24,506
Hello, everyone!
Nice to see you.

695
01:08:24,572 --> 01:08:27,782
I'm your detective for the evening.
Please don't leave the premises.

696
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:34,215
I said nobody leave! Am I speaking
in some kind of strange foreign language?

697
01:08:34,984 --> 01:08:36,926
Check for hairpieces, lenses, dentures.

698
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,993
I want napkins. I want cigarette butts.
I want the saliva off teacups.

699
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,217
That's a familiar face.
Check him out, will you?

700
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,487
I thought you wanted to dance.

701
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,430
- Excuse me. Where are you going?
- Oh yeah, I know. Just a minute.

702
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:58,030
Jerome!
Jerome!

703
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:08,893
- Are you insane?
- Come on!

704
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,516
Where did they go?
Where did they go!

705
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,975
Come here. Come on.

706
01:09:47,304 --> 01:09:50,600
- Don't you understand? I can't do that.
- You just did.

707
01:09:51,464 --> 01:09:54,725
Don't touch your face!
Don't swallow! Don't spit!

708
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:56,646
Let's clean his teeth.

709
01:10:00,546 --> 01:10:01,246
Vincent

710
01:10:06,016 --> 01:10:07,016
Vincent!

711
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:15,907
Who's Vincent?

712
01:10:21,007 --> 01:10:21,907
I...

713
01:10:27,144 --> 01:10:28,999
Don't say anything.

714
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,299
Don't say anything.

715
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:20,098
What happened?

716
01:13:23,496 --> 01:13:25,351
The scars on your legs?

717
01:13:26,551 --> 01:13:28,351
Oh, uh...

718
01:13:29,768 --> 01:13:32,900
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

719
01:13:32,968 --> 01:13:36,481
This is the exact height
of the front fender.

720
01:13:36,552 --> 01:13:39,072
I looked left instead of right.

721
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:45,405
Did you just make that up,
or do you use it all the time?

722
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,619
I use it all the time.

723
01:13:49,448 --> 01:13:52,415
I know you had something to do
with the director's death.

724
01:13:52,488 --> 01:13:54,277
That's not true, Irene.

725
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,415
Isn't that the man from last night?

726
01:14:07,784 --> 01:14:09,889
He's nobody.

727
01:14:19,144 --> 01:14:21,697
He's one of our best.

728
01:14:21,768 --> 01:14:24,736
I'm certain he has nothing
to do with this business.

729
01:14:27,536 --> 01:14:28,536
Jerome Morrow.

730
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,317
You don't look well, Jerome.

731
01:14:41,384 --> 01:14:43,489
Why don't you go home?

732
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,550
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for Jerome Morrow.

733
01:14:56,616 --> 01:15:00,097
I'm sorry. He's ill with nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

734
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:02,023
Really?

735
01:15:02,088 --> 01:15:05,863
I ought to pay him a visit.
I understand you can show me the way.

736
01:15:48,712 --> 01:15:50,600
You don't know who he is, do you, Irene?

737
01:16:10,228 --> 01:16:11,028
Hello?

738
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:13,088
Eugene, I need you
to be yourself for the day.

739
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,549
I was never very good at it,
remember?

740
01:16:15,624 --> 01:16:18,406
The investigators are coming by.
I'm supposed to be sick.

741
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:21,603
So you keep telling me.
How long have I got?

742
01:16:21,672 --> 01:16:23,046
Not long.

743
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:08,323
I guess he's not home.

744
01:18:11,624 --> 01:18:13,925
- Hello?
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.

745
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:15,879
Yes. That's me.
Come up.

746
01:18:17,672 --> 01:18:19,527
I guess he's home.

747
01:18:53,128 --> 01:18:54,884
Come in!

748
01:18:56,884 --> 01:18:57,784
Come in

749
01:19:00,648 --> 01:19:02,055
Hello, sweetheart.

750
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:06,372
Where's my kiss?

751
01:19:10,536 --> 01:19:13,383
Good to see you're feeling better.

752
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,800
Of course. Now that you're here.

753
01:19:25,032 --> 01:19:26,886
Who's your friend?

754
01:19:28,456 --> 01:19:30,311
How can I help?

755
01:19:30,376 --> 01:19:32,515
It's about the director.

756
01:19:32,584 --> 01:19:34,373
Oh. Again?

757
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:37,309
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no. No trouble.

758
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,895
Forgive me for not giving you
a guided tour.

759
01:19:40,968 --> 01:19:44,132
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- This won't take a moment.

760
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,982
Maybe he can tell me what I've got.

761
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,129
Who were you expecting?

762
01:21:05,352 --> 01:21:07,207
- Yes?
- We have our man, sir.

763
01:21:07,272 --> 01:21:08,734
- You have him?
- We have him in custody.

764
01:21:08,808 --> 01:21:10,663
I'll come right away.

765
01:21:33,928 --> 01:21:35,553
How are you, Jerome?

766
01:21:35,624 --> 01:21:37,479
Not bad, Jerome.

767
01:21:40,616 --> 01:21:43,715
- How the hell did you get up here?
- Oh, I could always walk.

768
01:21:43,784 --> 01:21:45,856
I've been faking it.

769
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:04,292
Irene! Irene...
Irene

770
01:22:04,392 --> 01:22:06,366
- Don't touch me!
- Listen to me, Irene.

771
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,295
I don't even know who you are.

772
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:10,913
I'm the same person I was yesterday.

773
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:13,799
I can't hear any more
of your lies, Jerome.

774
01:22:13,864 --> 01:22:16,995
My name is Vincent!
I am Vincent Anton Freeman.

775
01:22:17,064 --> 01:22:20,447
I'm a faith birth, de-gene-erate,
whatever you want to call it.

776
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,335
But I am not a murderer.

777
01:22:24,392 --> 01:22:25,887
You're a God child?

778
01:22:27,816 --> 01:22:30,337
But we do have one thing in common.

779
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:34,751
Only I don't have 20 or 30 years left in mine.
Mine is already 10,000 beats overdue.

780
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,814
- It's not possible.
- You are the authority...

781
01:22:38,888 --> 01:22:42,205
on what is not possible,
aren't you, Irene?

782
01:22:44,808 --> 01:22:47,743
They have got you looking
so hard for any flaw...

783
01:22:47,816 --> 01:22:50,118
that after a while
that's all that you see.

784
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,139
For whatever it's worth...

785
01:22:55,208 --> 01:22:58,110
I'm here to tell you
that it is possible.

786
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,063
It is possible.

787
01:23:38,568 --> 01:23:41,351
Congratulations, sir.
We did it.

788
01:23:42,376 --> 01:23:45,059
His spit was found
in the dead director's eye.

789
01:23:45,128 --> 01:23:48,990
While I was busy obsessing
about an eyelash, your instincts...

790
01:23:49,064 --> 01:23:51,486
took us in the right direction.

791
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,756
So the In-Valid had nothing
to do with this?

792
01:23:54,824 --> 01:23:57,759
No. Our friend here acted alone.
This mission meant everything to him.

793
01:23:57,832 --> 01:23:59,806
Didn't it?

794
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,916
If they miss this launch window,
he won't live to see the next one.

795
01:24:06,984 --> 01:24:11,326
And since nothing can stop the launch now,
he's being very very cooperative.

796
01:24:15,368 --> 01:24:16,742
So I imagine...

797
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:19,525
you'll be celebrating tonight, sir.

798
01:24:19,592 --> 01:24:20,967
Of course.

799
01:24:36,904 --> 01:24:38,278
I think she likes us.

800
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,139
Yeah, sure. Just give her a little time.
She'll get used to the idea.

801
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:46,983
- What was he like?
- Who? The cop?

802
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:49,382
- He was just a cop.
- Did you catch his name?

803
01:24:49,448 --> 01:24:50,975
Actually, my name was the topic
of conversation.

804
01:24:51,048 --> 01:24:52,990
Yeah, well, he'll be back.

805
01:24:53,064 --> 01:24:54,919
You heard what they said.
They have their man. It's over.

806
01:24:54,984 --> 01:24:58,399
No, it's not over.
I have to meet him.

807
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:25,099
Vincent?

808
01:25:35,208 --> 01:25:37,063
My God, you have changed.

809
01:25:40,968 --> 01:25:43,488
Has it been so long
you don't recognize your own brother?

810
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,734
Are we brothers?

811
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:49,182
Our parents both died
thinking they'd outlived you.

812
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:51,622
I had my doubts.

813
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:53,859
What are you doing here, Anton?

814
01:25:53,928 --> 01:25:56,165
I should ask you that question.

815
01:25:56,232 --> 01:25:59,232
I have a right to be here.
You don't.

816
01:26:01,256 --> 01:26:04,387
You almost sound
as if you believe that.

817
01:26:04,456 --> 01:26:09,093
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

818
01:26:09,928 --> 01:26:11,455
You committed fraud.

819
01:26:13,832 --> 01:26:16,101
Listen, you've a lot of trouble, Vincent.
I can get you out of here.

820
01:26:16,168 --> 01:26:18,721
Do you have any idea
what it took to get in here?

821
01:26:18,792 --> 01:26:21,377
You've gone as far as you can go.
Come with me now!

822
01:26:22,536 --> 01:26:24,674
There is still a few million
miles left to go.

823
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,173
It's over!

824
01:26:26,248 --> 01:26:29,215
Is that the only way you can succeed
is to see me fail?

825
01:26:29,288 --> 01:26:33,347
God! Even you are gonna tell me
what I can and can't do now!

826
01:26:34,888 --> 01:26:38,685
In case you haven't noticed,
I don't need any rescuing.

827
01:26:39,688 --> 01:26:41,215
But you did once.

828
01:26:43,208 --> 01:26:47,299
Well, you've got all the answers.
How do you explain that?

829
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,605
You didn't beat me that day.
I beat myself.

830
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:52,519
Who are you trying to convince?

831
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,462
Do you want me
to prove it to you?

832
01:26:56,392 --> 01:27:00,036
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

833
01:27:01,256 --> 01:27:05,217
I'll prove it to you! Do you want me
to prove it to you? I'll prove it to you!

834
01:27:05,288 --> 01:27:06,881
I do.

835
01:28:10,081 --> 01:28:10,881
Vincent!

836
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:13,840
Vincent!

837
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,615
Where's the shore?
We're too far out!

838
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,752
- You wanna quit?
- We're too far out!

839
01:28:19,052 --> 01:28:20,052
You wanna quit?

840
01:28:22,012 --> 01:28:22,902
No!

841
01:28:44,902 --> 01:28:45,702
Vincent!

842
01:28:47,272 --> 01:28:50,371
How are you doing this, Vincent?

843
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:53,123
How have you done any of this?

844
01:28:53,192 --> 01:28:56,007
- We have to go back.
- It's too late for that.

845
01:28:56,072 --> 01:28:58,145
We're closer to the other side.

846
01:28:58,216 --> 01:29:00,550
What other side?
You wanna drown us both?

847
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,545
You wanna know how I did it?

848
01:29:04,616 --> 01:29:09,056
This is how I did it, Anton.
I never saved anything for the swim back.

849
01:30:49,704 --> 01:30:52,323
You couldn't see, could you?

850
01:30:52,392 --> 01:30:55,109
That night, crossing the street.

851
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:58,598
You crossed anyway.

852
01:31:12,968 --> 01:31:14,342
If you're still interested...

853
01:31:16,104 --> 01:31:17,478
Let me know.

854
01:31:23,848 --> 01:31:25,222
Sorry.

855
01:31:29,928 --> 01:31:32,100
The wind caught it.

856
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:25,987
You're flying today, aren't you?

857
01:32:26,056 --> 01:32:28,871
Look at what a mess you're in.

858
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,375
Come on.
I have your samples ready.

859
01:32:35,464 --> 01:32:37,471
I don't need any samples
where I'm going.

860
01:32:41,704 --> 01:32:43,908
You might when you get back.

861
01:32:46,952 --> 01:32:49,821
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

862
01:32:52,392 --> 01:32:54,246
Why have you done all this?

863
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,495
So Jerome will always be here
when you need him.

864
01:32:58,568 --> 01:33:02,430
- Where are you going?
- I'm traveling too.

865
01:33:06,024 --> 01:33:08,512
I don't know how to thank you.

866
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:14,215
I got the better end of the deal.

867
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,418
I only lent you my body.

868
01:33:17,768 --> 01:33:19,808
You lent me your dream.

869
01:33:29,448 --> 01:33:31,717
Not until you're upstairs.

870
01:34:03,208 --> 01:34:04,582
What is this?

871
01:34:04,648 --> 01:34:06,174
New policy.

872
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,687
Flight got you nervous?

873
01:34:16,264 --> 01:34:18,849
Well, there's a problem, Lamar.

874
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:22,662
I never told you about my son, did I?
He's a big fan of yours.

875
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,868
Just remember...

876
01:34:28,936 --> 01:34:32,449
that I was as good as any
and better than most.

877
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,528
He wants to apply here.

878
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:38,495
I could've gone up and back,
and nobody would've been the wiser.

879
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:42,599
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

880
01:34:44,392 --> 01:34:46,694
But then, who knows
what he could do?

881
01:34:48,232 --> 01:34:49,825
Right?

882
01:35:05,928 --> 01:35:08,416
For future reference...

883
01:35:08,488 --> 01:35:11,619
right-handed men
don't hold it with their left.

884
01:35:11,688 --> 01:35:13,958
Just one of those things.

885
01:35:26,504 --> 01:35:28,740
You're gonna miss your flight, Vincent.

886
01:38:08,328 --> 01:38:10,784
For someone who was never
meant for this world...

887
01:38:10,856 --> 01:38:14,532
I must confess I'm suddenly
having a hard time leaving it.

888
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:21,215
Of course, they say every atom
in our bodies was once part of a star.

889
01:38:22,664 --> 01:38:24,966
Maybe I'm not leaving.

890
01:38:25,032 --> 01:38:26,887
Maybe I'm going home.
