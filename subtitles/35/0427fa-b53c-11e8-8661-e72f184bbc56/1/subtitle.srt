1
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,595
Whoa! Whoa!

2
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,711
Whoa!

3
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,874
Whoa.

4
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,758
- Easy.
- Mornin'.

5
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,389
Mornin'. Y'all mind
steppin' aside?

6
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,109
- You know what I think?
- No, sir, I don't.

7
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,193
I think you got yourselves
a shipment of gold in that wagon...

8
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,919
that you're bringin'
to General Lee.

9
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,675
- Just who might you be?
- A friend of the Confederacy.

10
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,639
Why don't y'all show us what a
good friend you are by steppin' aside?

11
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,712
I'd be most happy to,
'cept first...

12
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,473
I'd be much obliged
if you'd give me that gold.

13
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,837
I don't think I heard you correct.

14
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,992
I think you did.
I'd like that gold now.

15
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,675
Listen, mister, it ain't
very nice out here, as you can see.

16
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,115
There are five of us.

17
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,670
If you don't step aside now,
I'd just as soon kill you as not.

18
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,957
You wanna die out here in this
miserable weather, that's your choice.

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,552
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

20
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,551
Would you please
give me the gold?

21
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,751
Good afternoon, senators.

22
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,752
The president is very
grateful for your time here.

23
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,877
Believe me, this is a matter
of the utmost importance.

24
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,871
I cannot stress too much
the utmost secrecy.

25
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,520
Why don't you just
cut out the shit, George?

26
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,354
You're here to ask the committee
for money, so come out and ask for it.

27
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,238
Thanks for the advice.
I am gonna ask you for money.

28
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,311
Guess what else?
You're gonna give it to me.

29
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,278
You all remember
Dr. Hans Kleindast...

30
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,511
the Nobel Laureate who helped us
during the space program?

31
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,079
For 20 years...

32
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,311
he's been keeping his face
off of Time magazine doing research.

33
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,755
His field of research
has been time travel.

34
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,990
- Time travel.
- Time travel.

35
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,356
- Well, beam me up, Scotty.
- That's very funny, Senator.

36
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,557
- Wanna know what's funnier than that?
- He's gonna tell us.

37
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,598
I thought that'd
get your attention.

38
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,355
He did it. The technology is
in the folders in front of you.

39
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,271
You won't understand it
any better than I can.

40
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,670
Now, you can't go forward,
because the future hasn't happened yet.

41
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,513
However, you can go back,
and that's where things get tricky.

42
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,991
If you go back and change something,
it's serious. It could be catastrophic.

43
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,275
It's like throwing
a stone in a lake...

44
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,635
only now there
are ripples in time.

45
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,996
So you can't go back and kill Hitler,
much as we'd like to...

46
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,958
because it could cause
a chain reaction of events...

47
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,600
that could alter
or even destroy mankind.

48
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,989
And that, my good senators,
is where you come in.

49
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,598
We have to form a new agency to police
this technology and protect time.

50
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,956
It will be called the Time Enforcement
Commission or the T.E.C.

51
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,068
Eugene Matuzak of the Washington PD.
is our choice to run the commission.

52
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,755
- How much is this gonna cost?
- A lot.

53
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,037
- How much is a lot?
- More than a little
and less than too much.

54
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,430
This is not a good time
to ask for money. The economy--

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,433
Suppose one of our competitors goes
back in time and invents the computer?

56
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,351
Or the airplane or the automobile?

57
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,476
You wanna talk about
the American economy, Senator?

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,836
How about this one?
Saddam Hussein finances a trip to 1944.

59
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,433
He gets our technology...

60
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,239
and Iraq becomes the first country
to have the atomic bomb.

61
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,153
- Oh, you like that one.
- Not bad.

62
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,038
Try this one.
We think there's already been a ripple.

63
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,749
Ten days ago, the C.I.A. broke up
an arms sale to terrorists...

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,671
in Hamburg, Germany.

65
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,399
Ordinarily, that sort of news
doesn't cross the president's desk.

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,993
What made this different...

67
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,071
was that the purchase
was made with gold bullion...

68
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,674
and the bullion
was dated 1863...

69
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,593
and stamped
"Confederate States of America."

70
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,399
We had it carbon-tested
and authenticated. It's real.

71
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,789
Now, just think
about what I'm saying.

72
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,077
Going back in time
is a pretty easy way to make money.

73
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,153
0ur committee would have exclusive
jurisdiction over this program?

74
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,313
Yours and yours alone. No one can know
about this. It's too dangerous.

75
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,789
That's very good, George.

76
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,075
Personally...

77
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,755
I think this sounds like that
bullshit Star Wars program.

78
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,675
You'll get your money. Anyone here want
to chair the oversight on this program?

79
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,512
Yeah, I'll do it.

80
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,637
Ah, young Senator McComb.

81
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,518
Why not?
Oh, you'll like him, George.

82
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,912
Very much like you,
except his dorsal fin's a bit bigger.

83
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,555
There's never enough time.

84
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,074
Never enough for what?

85
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,754
To satisfy a woman.

86
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,116
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

87
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,958
Are you busy?

88
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,031
I'm meeting my husband.

89
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,197
If I were him,
I would not keep you waiting.

90
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,039
If he's not here when I turn around,
I'll go home with you.

91
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,599
You'll do.

92
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,350
Mmm.

93
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,351
I didn't hear you
leave this morning.

94
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,193
It was early.
I was meeting with Matuzak.

95
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,679
Are you gonna
take that job?

96
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,076
- What?
- Be right back.

97
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,190
Read it.

98
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,358
- "Wolverine"?
- Between the lines.

99
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,273
I should get
the fuck outta here.

100
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,191
Good.

101
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,431
You know that purse?
Doesn't look good on you.

102
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,071
Thank you.

103
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,516
- Glad you're not hurt.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,553
Smart kid.
He read my mind.

105
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,471
With your English,
he doesn't have much choice.

106
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,637
Hey, I know all the good words.

107
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,314
You didn't answer my question.

108
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,109
- Are you gonna take this job?
- I think so.

109
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,509
Is this T.E.C. thing dangerous?

110
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,670
I don't bake cookies for a living.

111
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,391
Will you have to travel?

112
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,278
Not the way you think.

113
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,352
Pictures bring back your memories.

114
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,716
Aw, you're gonna
be very happy you have this.

115
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,791
Why?

116
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,111
I can see into the future.

117
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,998
- You can see the future, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

118
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,789
- What do you see?
- I see it's gonna rain.

119
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,474
We both have
the afternoon off.

120
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,873
Why don't we go and practice some of
those words you seem to like so much?

121
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,111
Max?

122
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,555
Hmm? What?

123
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,590
I have something I want to tell you.

124
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,511
Shit. I'm sorry.

125
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,070
Don't answer it.
Just this once, don't answer it.

126
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,720
I have to.

127
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,116
Walker.

128
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,071
Now?

129
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,913
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Can you find somebody else?

130
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,799
Look, uh, somebody
called in sick and--

131
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,836
And there's nobody
but Max Walker...

132
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,070
- to keep the streets safe.
- I said I was sorry.

133
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,357
- It's not like I have a choice.
- Of course you have a choice.

134
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,433
- This is what I do.
- I know that's what you do.

135
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,318
It's just that things
are different now.

136
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,550
What are you
talking about?

137
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,996
This isn't the way
I wanted to do this.

138
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,957
I have to go.

139
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,235
There's something
you need to tell me?

140
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,709
Yes.

141
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,109
Can you wait
until I get back?

142
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,952
Sure.

143
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,595
Surprise.

144
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,680
Max!

145
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,191
Melissa!

146
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,350
Max!

147
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,035
- Finish him.
- Who are you?

148
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,556
You're a smart boy.
Why don't you sleep on it a while?

149
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,757
Nothing to see over there.
It's just another jumper.

150
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,671
Hang on, there, buddy!

151
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,228
All right, close enough! That's it!

152
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,550
Thank you!
Stand back, folks!

153
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,518
Come on! Break it up!
There's nothin' to see!

154
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,991
Go back to work. Come on!
Come on, now! Come on, now.

155
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,071
Break it up.
Go back to work.

156
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,720
Come on. Come on,
get out of here.

157
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,200
- Good morning, Mr. Atwood.
- Good morning, Charlie.

158
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,874
- It's a terrible day, sir.
- Beat it.

159
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,155
- What's goin' on?
- Mr. Floatbauer.

160
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,351
He went off the roof.

161
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,871
Ah, yeah.

162
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,157
Well, shit happens.
Excuse me.

163
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,708
Oh, that poor man!

164
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,551
Good morning, Pete.

165
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,517
Good morning, Mr. Atwood.

166
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,593
Third jumper this week. They keep
this up, you're gonna be out of a job.

167
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,591
0nly going down, sir.

168
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,998
There he is!

169
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,198
- Mr. Atwood, isn't it terrible?
- Tragic.

170
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,077
...little lovebirds

171
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,071
We're not above birds

172
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,276
Let's misbehave

173
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,879
Slip and slide

174
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,474
Slip inside

175
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,875
Slip and slide

176
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,838
I learn to love
I learn to live

177
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,915
Get me Ross.

178
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,037
Ross! Hi!
Yeah, listen.

179
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,510
I want another 100,000 shares
of Middle States 0il.

180
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,592
No, no. Just buy it.
It's an act of faith.

181
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,353
I really think things
are gonna turn around.

182
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,749
I got a feeling
about the future.

183
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,195
Look, I gotta go.
I'm-- I'm very busy.

184
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,833
- Walker.
- How've you been, Lyle?

185
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,395
How ya doin', partner?

186
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,439
- Ex-partner.
- Max.

187
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,069
I'm not gonna change a thing. The only
ripples'll be in my swimming pool.

188
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,232
It's a nice place.
You couldn't do this by yourself.

189
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,198
- Who are you working for?
- I'm not hurtin' anybody.

190
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,831
It's America, man! I'm just
takin' an opportunity, that's all.

191
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,718
I've got to take you back.

192
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,517
I went ten rounds with
John L. Sullivan himself.

193
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,511
Oh.

194
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,235
I saw Tyson beat Spinks on TV.

195
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,877
- Mr. Atwood-- Oh, my god!
- Get down.

196
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,709
Doesn't look too good, Lyle.

197
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,631
Let me go, Max.

198
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,676
I'll stay here.
I won't go back.

199
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,876
Who sent you?
I want the name.

200
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,791
Like it'll make any difference.

201
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,678
In a few weeks,
this guy's gonna run the whole country.

202
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,797
If he doesn't get the money here,
he's gonna get it somewhere else.

203
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,634
I can't tell you. He'll send somebody
back to wipe out my grandparents.

204
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,994
It'll be like I never existed:

205
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,919
my mother, my father, my wife,
my kids, my fuckin' cat!

206
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,915
You ever hear of the name Aaron McComb?
Senator McComb?

207
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,835
Bullshit.

208
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,912
You don't understand.
He's gonna be president.

209
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,798
He's doin' this to get
money for his campaign.

210
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,634
Shit, Max, he already
owns most of the guys we work with!

211
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,598
When we get back,
you'll point them out.

212
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,639
You're out of your mind.
This guy's gonna roll right over you.

213
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,029
- We'll see. Let's go.
- Listen to me!

214
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,669
If I go back and talk,
my family is dead.

215
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,877
I'm talkin' about my f--
my family!

216
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,593
If I die here, it's only me.
I can't go back!

217
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,310
I have to bring you back.
I have no choice.

218
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,591
Neither do I.

219
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,233
Holy Mother of Mary!

220
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,996
Lieutenant Clapton, 0316.

221
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,957
Lieutenant Clapton.

222
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,196
Testify and I'll do what I can.

223
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,432
Communication relays
rerouted to Alpha 02.

224
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,518
Captain Lyle Atwood,
you are charged with violations...

225
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,956
of T.E.C. code 40.8,
subsection nine...

226
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,634
time travel with intent
to alter the future.

227
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,429
Charges are compounded by your current
status as a time enforcement officer.

228
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,590
Does the defendant
have any statement?

229
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,150
- Tell her.
- Something to say on your own behalf?

230
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,789
- Yes.
- No.

231
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,599
Then I will pass sentence
as mandated by our charter.

232
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,638
Say something.
Come on. Say something!

233
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,950
The defendant has been
found guilty...

234
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,439
Take care of yourself, Max.

235
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,750
and is sentenced to death,
immediately.

236
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,431
Poor bastard.

237
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,273
Tomorrow might've been
a brighter day.

238
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,592
We're pickin' up
some noise outside Camp David, '79.

239
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,478
Intelligence thinks
it's a kill team out of Iran.

240
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,391
It's their third
try this year.

241
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,311
C.I.A.'s trying to locate
their launch facility.

242
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,233
I want two teams on this date.
Let's smoke these guys.

243
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,914
- Right.
- Number two: Los Angeles, 1902.

244
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,630
Somebody's trying to get a jump on
real-estate, buying up Beverly Hills.

245
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,551
- Burr and Swain got the deal.
- Yes, sir.

246
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,392
You look like shit.

247
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,311
- We have to talk.
- In a minute.

248
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,550
- Now.
- I said in a minute.

249
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,031
Temporary wave guide
shutdown in three minutes.

250
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,394
Shit. Go over your dispatch notes
and check with me before you launch.

251
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,630
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- George. Welcome.

252
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,713
Gene. Senator Nelson, this is
T.E.C. Director Matuzak.

253
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,837
Senator Nelson is the newest member
of the oversight committee.

254
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,911
Since he's gonna be voting
on your budget...

255
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,592
he'd like to see how it's spent.

256
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,116
Senator McComb,
our long-standing committee chairman...

257
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,034
agreed to take time out from his
presidential campaign to accompany us.

258
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,951
Senator.

259
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,349
Well. Be a pleasure
to show you around.

260
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,749
Are these all of your agents?

261
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,752
Most of 'em. Agent Monroe.
Agent Anderson.

262
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,354
Agents Burr, Bartolo and Shepherd.

263
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,398
- Agent Walker.
- Agent Walker.

264
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,671
I've heard a great deal about you.

265
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,673
- And I've heard a lot about you.
- Not all of it bad, I hope.

266
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,278
Agent Walker just returned
from a successful mission.

267
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,909
Well, congratulations,
Agent Walker.

268
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,793
Senator, now Director Matuzak
will show you the launch room.

269
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,235
Follow me.
I'll show you where we kick off.

270
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,675
You wouldn't mind
if Agent Walker accompanied us?

271
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,877
I'd love to hear about
his most recent mission.

272
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,351
- I have a report to file.
- Agent Walker would be delighted.

273
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,398
All units switch to TEC channel three.

274
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,472
All units switch
to TEC channel three.

275
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,710
As you can see,
we've spared every expense.

276
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,554
No comfort, no convenience,
no necessities. Watch your head.

277
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,835
So, Agent Walker,
who were you after?

278
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,514
A man named Atwood.
Ring a bell?

279
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,070
Atwood. No.
Should that name be familiar to me?

280
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,199
- Unfortunately, Atwood was a TEC agent.
- Really?

281
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,078
See, George, I don't
want to sound like a broken record...

282
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,958
but that's one of the dangers
of having an agency like this.

283
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,113
- Imagine the dangers of not having it.
- Did you know this Atwood?

284
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,031
He was my partner.

285
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,829
Oh, I'm sorry.
Nothing worse than a rogue cop.

286
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,310
- Except the guy who paid him.
- If there is such a guy.

287
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,154
- There always is.
- Do you know who the man is?

288
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,391
- Oh, yeah.
- Why don't you arrest him?

289
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,313
- I lost my witness.
- Oh.

290
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,152
Well, I trust you'll
keep working on it.

291
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,913
You can bet on it.

292
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,475
Hydrogen specialists,
prepare for inspection.

293
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,070
We've updated our entire operation
to Parker Datalink Systems...

294
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,196
utilizing their
superconducting chip.

295
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,475
Senator McComb
was Jack Parker's partner...

296
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,314
and sold out before the company
got the patent on that chip.

297
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,960
- Bet that cost you a few billion.
- Whoa, bad luck.

298
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,630
My deal with Jack Parker
is not important, Mr. Spota.

299
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,712
What is important is talking about
the dangers of this program.

300
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,076
- You got my vote.
- Excuse me. What dangers?

301
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,549
Well, dishonest agents
like this, uh, Atwood.

302
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,031
Every time an agent goes back,
he risks making contact with
the past version of himself.

303
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,759
- That could be a disaster.
- And why is that?

304
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,515
The same matter can't occupy
the same space at the same time.

305
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,830
It's never happened.

306
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,672
Not yet, but what I propose...

307
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,830
is far less costly
yet accomplishes the same thing.

308
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,797
Why don't we just
prevent time travel...

309
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,792
rather than spend money
trying to police it?

310
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,836
I have to get back
to the Hill.

311
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,630
Malcolm, this is a project
that we could do without.

312
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,836
I hope you vote against
continued appropriations.

313
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,636
I admire your dedication,
Agent Walker.

314
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,038
I hope you keep trying
to get your man.

315
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,678
I never quit.

316
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,632
We've done a breakdown
of the latest poll results.

317
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,354
While the trends
are not what we want...

318
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,590
there are some good things
we can utilize.

319
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,955
The numbers in the suburbs
are encouraging...

320
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,156
but they are killing you
in the urban centers.

321
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,279
But you're gaining with the pro-life,
pro-death-penalty coalition...

322
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,511
and with the close-our-border,
anti-immigration faction.

323
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,071
The bad news is the campaign chairman
put together a projected budget...

324
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,277
from now to Election Day,
and it's a big number.

325
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,990
Even going back again, I don't see how
you could get it all in time.

326
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,432
Lawrence, I love you.
I really do.

327
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,715
But don't tell me
what I can't do.

328
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,394
Elections are won with television.

329
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,631
You don't need the press, endorsements.
You don't even need the truth.

330
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,436
You need money.

331
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,676
So... tell me.

332
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,117
How much is it gonna cost
to buy the network time I need?

333
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,509
- $50 million.
- $50 million.

334
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,591
Agent Walker has already
cost me that much.

335
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,673
We're gonna chat with him, the kind
of chat a man remembers for a lifetime.

336
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,799
Sure is a handsome devil, isn't he?

337
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,270
- He's not my type.
- What did you want to talk about?

338
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,635
What do you know
about him?

339
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,950
Capable of eating
his young.

340
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,508
He sure seemed interested
in you this afternoon.

341
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,477
He interests me.

342
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,437
Atwood named him.

343
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,354
- You're shittin' me.
- He's the one who sent him back.

344
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,876
- Why didn't he testify?
- McComb would go after his family.

345
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,475
He also said McComb
has half of the agency. I believe him.

346
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,358
He doesn't have me.

347
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,318
I said, he doesn't have me.

348
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,233
- Well, fuck you too.
- He's gonna close the agency.

349
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,630
Then no one can stop him
from going back.

350
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,280
- This one is mine.
- Not unless I say it is.

351
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,999
The son of a bitch
is a presidential candidate.

352
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,073
If you haul him in, you better have
enough evidence to plug up the Potomac.

353
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,037
- You believe me.
- I always believe you...

354
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,714
but you're not always right.

355
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,917
Yeah.

356
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,918
Come over to the house for dinner.

357
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,956
Carol would love to see you.

358
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,429
Thanks. Some other time.

359
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,796
You're allowed to have a life.
I read it in a manual.

360
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,156
I'll tell you this:
If I cannot go back to save her...

361
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,516
this scumbag is not
going back to steal money.

362
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,471
Go home, Max.

363
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,678
If you won't come to mine,
go to yours.

364
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,238
By the way, when I said
McComb hasn't bought me...

365
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,357
you were supposed to say,
"I know that."

366
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,391
I know that.

367
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,155
System initialized.

368
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,629
Destination, please.

369
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,915
Home.

370
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,316
There are no new messages.

371
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,914
Television.

372
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,314
Play tape.

373
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,551
It's going to look like
this when I'm finished.

374
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,029
See? Very nice.

375
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,716
"Victorian Villa Deluxe Birdhouse."

376
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,236
This thing is gonna be bigger
than our house by the time I'm done.

377
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,196
0kay. Uh-huh.

378
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,999
- Want some help?
- Want some help?

379
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,911
Yeah. You can buy the birdseed.

380
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,798
0kay. Divide all these parts...

381
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,156
into groups to determine
their structural function.

382
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,549
- I should buy more videotapes.
- I should buy more videotapes.

383
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,471
Gotta be in the mood to do this.

384
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,711
- You were a second ago.
- You were a second ago.

385
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,677
I think that I should...

386
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:37,752
start with something
easier to put together.

387
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,115
Huh? Honey?

388
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,988
Maybe you should lay out
all the parts first, then...

389
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,231
- You know--
- I think I wanna try from memory.

390
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,039
Just find part "A"
and work from there.

391
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,998
The controversy...

392
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,834
over government-provided campaign funds
is in the news again.

393
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,196
The White Supremacist Party has
qualified for matching funds...

394
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,114
sparking many groups to petition
for the abolition of the practice.

395
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,998
Meanwhile, Senator McComb's
fading presidential bid...

396
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,479
received another blow...

397
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,358
when today it was denied
federal campaign matching funds.

398
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,398
Sources indicate
the senator is out of money...

399
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,472
and may be forced
to withdraw from the race.

400
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,869
Though no official
statement has been made...

401
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,714
independent party leaders claim that
the denial will bolster their play...

402
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,631
for the upcoming
presidential election.

403
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,757
With the polls showing
independent candidate Elgin Michaels...

404
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,671
trailing the incumbent
by only six points--

405
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,991
There are no new messages.

406
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,831
Who are you?
Who sent you?

407
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,195
Who sent you?

408
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,229
Fifty thousand volts, motherfucker.

409
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,151
Have a nice day.

410
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,311
Walker?

411
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,829
Walker!

412
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,157
My name's Fielding.
I'm with Internal Affairs.

413
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,955
He messed up my apartment.
You can kill him.

414
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,552
You've got some more inside.

415
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,315
- Everybody freeze!
- I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

416
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,356
ID.
ID.

417
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,317
Get in there.

418
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,436
You, he's under arrest.

419
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,351
They're all under arrest.

420
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,991
Assault, attempted murder,
makin' a mess.

421
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,196
Sector 17, Sector 19.

422
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,350
Report for duty
in five minutes.

423
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,151
If you'd like,
I'll have the door removed.

424
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,071
I had company
this morning.

425
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,720
- You look like they stayed awhile.
- McComb sent them.

426
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,075
- Did they say that?
- I said that.

427
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,833
- And what does I.A. want?
- Atwood was your partner.

428
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,435
Internal Affairs isn't convinced
you can be trusted anymore.

429
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,513
- She's not going to follow me.
- We've got a phase four. You take it.

430
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,034
Send somebody else.
I want to be where McComb is.

431
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,432
A little refresher course in Agency
etiquette: I'm the director, I direct.

432
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:14,513
I authorize the missions. I make
the assignments. This one's yours.

433
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,752
This agency isn't dead yet, but if I
can't keep you from McComb, it will be!

434
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,798
- Fielding, get in here!
- She'll get in my way.

435
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,838
Ask her to stay behind you.
You've got an hour until launch.

436
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,673
- You're not funny.
- I'm never funny.

437
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,949
Yeah?

438
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,349
Disturbance has jumped
from four to six, sir.

439
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,799
Yes.

440
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,749
Yes.

441
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,956
I catch you fuckin' this machine again,
I'll break your neck.

442
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,679
- Sorry, Chief.
- Looks like safe sex to me.

443
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,796
- Show me.
- 0kay.

444
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,954
Here we go. The ripple was steady
at four, then spiked past five to six.

445
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:08,600
0n the board, it looks
like it set off Waimea.

446
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,989
Somebody's really doing a number.

447
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,435
We've located the point
of origin and...

448
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,318
- it's right here in Washington.
- Shit.

449
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,868
Come on.
You're out of here.

450
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,030
You should have an exhibit.

451
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,796
Oh, really? All my best stuff's
at home.

452
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,190
I really could care less
whether you like me or not...

453
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,111
but you don't know
a thing about me.

454
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,714
T minus three minutes and counting.

455
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,631
I've been with LA. for two years.

456
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,396
I'm field-rated in weapons and tactics
and speak three languages. Impressed?

457
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,711
- I'm blown away.
- I read the Atwood file.

458
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,711
You didn't mention you could read.

459
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,076
He was your friend,
and you still asked to go after him.

460
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,118
- He crossed the line.
- Or he crossed you.

461
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,637
Launch sequence activated.

462
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,269
Authorized personnel only in the area.

463
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,352
She looks just like the Vollmers!

464
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,556
T minus two minutes and counting.

465
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,471
Why is everyone so nervous?

466
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,519
When a launch goes wrong,
they're the guys who scrape the wall.

467
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,637
And you do look like
the Vollmer twins.

468
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,711
Who are the Vollmer twins?

469
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,114
Launch personnel only in the bay.

470
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:35,192
T minus one minute 30 seconds
and counting.

471
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,954
Magnetic field polarity
initiation in ten seconds.

472
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,070
Telemetry check is initiated.

473
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,715
Are we gonna blast to the past!

474
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,917
Yee-hah!

475
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,316
Green for launch!

476
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,671
I've run dozens
of simulated launches...

477
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,830
but I-I never noticed
that wall before.

478
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,559
- "Simulated"?
- This is my first real launch.

479
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,757
Great. Don't stick
your head out of the window.

480
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:30,116
- She's a little shaky.
- Blood pressure'll loosen her teeth.

481
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,957
Her pulse is pushing 140.

482
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,076
If she farts, she'll get
ahead of the pod.

483
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,596
Fielding, listen to me.
it helps to concentrate...

484
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,752
on something relaxing
during a launch.

485
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,230
What do you think about?

486
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,555
Not swallowing my tongue.

487
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,758
- How's Walker?
- You'd have to shake him...

488
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,193
to be sure he's awake.

489
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,670
- He's awake.
- T minus 30 seconds.

490
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,230
29... 28... 27... 26...

491
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,235
25... 24... 23...
22... 21... 20...

492
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,596
- Have they ever lost a pod?
- Ask the Vollmers.

493
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,478
- Where are they?
- See those two red spots?

494
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,120
12... 11... 10...

495
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,589
- Oh, God.
- Nine... eight... seven...

496
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,069
Six... five... four...

497
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,311
Three... two... one...

498
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,755
Zero.

499
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,630
They're away.

500
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,757
Is this the hottest thing or what?

501
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,110
Goddamn Ricky.

502
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,671
So much for a dry run.

503
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,830
We're alive.

504
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,959
- Are we where we're supposed to be?
- Give me a date.

505
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,350
Sunday, October 9, 1994.

506
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,035
Target.

507
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,396
- We're close.
- October 9?

508
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,311
- I'll be 16 tomorrow.
- Where?

509
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,837
I was living in Colorado.
Man, this is weird. Whew.

510
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,959
Yeah? Well, don't get sentimental
and try to visit yourself.

511
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,828
I'd like to call myself, tell me not to
sleep with Bobby Morgan after my party.

512
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,753
It's really disappointing.

513
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,070
A smart woman
would call Bobby...

514
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,469
and give him
some advice.

515
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,949
Aw, yeah, right.

516
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,075
- How long was Atwood your partner?
- Three years.

517
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,790
- Was it difficult to bring him back?
- What do you think?

518
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,799
You got a family?
Hmm?

519
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,348
Mine's still in Colorado.

520
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,635
When my dad started
reading about time travel...

521
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,757
he said it was a bigger threat
to the world than the nuclear bomb.

522
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,035
He's right.

523
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,951
That's why I joined the agency.

524
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,952
The world should be able to party
on Saturday night...

525
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,838
and not worry whether the planet's
going to be here on Monday.

526
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,674
- You sound like a woman I knew.
- Someone remarkable, I hope.

527
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,591
- Yeah.

528
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,956
Someone you knew, huh?
So, where is she?

529
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,871
She was killed.

530
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,791
Sorry.

531
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,350
You must've thought
about going back and changing that.

532
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,114
We're here.

533
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,797
Huh.

534
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,273
I thought it was
just Parker Datalink.

535
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,636
Take the back
and wait for my call.

536
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,518
Keep your head down.
Tomorrow's your birthday.

537
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,680
- I have a problem.
- You do?

538
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,558
Yes. Let me tell you
what my problem is.

539
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,438
This isn't working.
I can't keep paying for this.

540
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,513
- Hey, it doesn't matter to me.
- Oh, but it should, Jack.

541
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,398
You're taking the goddamn company
into bankruptcy.

542
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,311
We have a difference of opinion.

543
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,960
The chip is the future of this company.

544
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,192
- Since you don't agree, walk away.
- This isn't the first time
we've had this conversation.

545
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,840
Come up with money
and I'm out of here.

546
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,115
You know I can't afford it...

547
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,955
but I've found an enterprising
banker with faith in the future.

548
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,838
Take it.

549
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,037
You're out.
You've got no faith in the company...

550
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,429
and I've got none in politicians.

551
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,952
If I were you,
I wouldn't cash that check.

552
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,237
It's gonna cost you
more than you'll ever know.

553
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,152
Hey, Jack, it's been a while.

554
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,993
- What is this?
- It's me.

555
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,878
Well, it's, it's him.

556
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,277
No, it's us.

557
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,351
W-W-Where did you come from?

558
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,479
- Are you his father?
- Do I look that old?

559
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,315
I'm a United States senator.
Hurting me is a federal offense.

560
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,789
- I don't know about Jack's business.
- Will you stop it?

561
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,395
J-Just stop it.
Get a grip.

562
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,517
I remember having bigger balls.

563
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,518
I'm gonna have to get
this fixed. Right--

564
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,909
Don't touch me.

565
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,515
Same matter can't occupy
the same space.

566
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,909
Same matter?

567
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,396
Secret session.

568
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,471
That's not for another week.

569
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,998
Time travel, someone says,
gets a big laugh.

570
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,117
Oh, Christ, you're me.

571
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,919
How far back have you come?

572
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,798
Never interrupt me
when I'm talking to myself.

573
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:12,997
- We're gonna take them.
- What's the signal?

574
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,552
You were a visionary.
The computer market was saturated.

575
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,631
The software stocks
were in the toilet...

576
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,110
and your fuckin' coldware
revolutionizes the industry.

577
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,395
I made a mistake.

578
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,552
- I came to tell you I changed my mind.
- Now.

579
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,237
Freeze!

580
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,916
Do you realize how inappropriate
that word is? Do I look frozen to you?

581
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,434
You look like shit to me.
Get away from him!

582
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,155
Move!

583
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,993
Drop the guns, now.

584
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,632
Under your jacket there's
a track-and-return module.

585
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,233
Throw it to me.

586
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,030
You, uh, gonna
leave me back here?

587
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,749
Do it.

588
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,471
Agent Walker, I wanna see how you get
down here and keep the gun on us.

589
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,516
What are you gonna do?
You gonna jump?

590
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,989
That's how the Vollmers
would do it.

591
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,271
Move back.

592
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,193
Give me the envelope.

593
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,157
Thank you.

594
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,516
The country's going down the drain
because of the special interests.

595
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,354
We need someone rich in the White House
who doesn't have to listen to anybody.

596
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,637
- What's that?
- The senator was having a fund-raiser.

597
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,029
When I'm in office,
it's gonna be like the '80s.

598
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:56,989
Top 10% will get richer, the rest can
emigrate to Mexico, live a better life.

599
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,230
So, you goin' or stayin'?

600
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,880
I think you plan too far ahead.

601
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,071
Obviously, you don't.

602
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,275
Anything else you want
to tell me about yourself?

603
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,834
Don't tell anyone I killed ya.
I'm out on bail.

604
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,435
Okay, let's finish up
and get out of here.

605
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,909
He's running for president.
I'm voting early.

606
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,117
Good seeing you again, Jack.

607
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:31,396
Maybe he'll calm down
after the election.

608
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,278
What's the big deal?

609
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,669
Point it, pull the trigger...

610
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,910
and, boom, somebody dies.

611
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,191
Get up there!
Get the module!

612
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,189
Fuckin' great!
Will you get him?

613
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,395
Goddamn it.

614
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,075
Oh!

615
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,432
Aaron!

616
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,471
Come here.

617
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,551
You own the company,
do you understand?

618
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,474
The chip is going to be worth billions,
my billions.

619
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,393
Now, read this.
Whoa, whoa! Whoa!

620
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,278
You just read it
and do what it says.

621
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,191
Now, you get out of here.

622
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,509
Oh. And will you do me a favor?

623
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,637
Will you lay off
the fuckin' candy bars?

624
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,069
Have a nice day.

625
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,794
- I should've said, "Freeze."
- I think he got the idea.

626
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,077
Do me a favor.
Don't give up without a fight.

627
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,878
Never crossed my mind.

628
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,879
I don't want
to fight a woman.

629
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,838
Then don't.

630
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,671
Changed my mind.

631
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,795
Tell me he's gonna
kill your family.

632
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,194
- Don't you leave me, damn it!
- Who are you talking to?

633
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,195
Stay here, Walker.

634
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,794
In my future, you're dead.

635
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,790
Look at this!

636
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,954
Let's get a canine unit
up there.

637
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,998
- What the hell's going on here?
- You're lucky you got back.

638
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,878
They're gettin' ready
to tear up these tracks.

639
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,269
- McComb?
- Who else?

640
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,715
- He hasn't got the power.
- Are you kiddin'?

641
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,918
He's ahead in the polls. He's probably
out buying running shoes for his team.

642
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,835
Senate committee caved in. They want
to be on the good side of the new boss.

643
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,795
What's the matter?
It's been headed this way for months.

644
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,711
When I left,
nothing had happened.

645
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,031
Hey, Walker, when they tear up the
launcher, you get the pod as a memento.

646
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,951
He's changed the future.

647
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,871
What are you talking about?

648
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,748
McComb.
He's buying the presidency.

649
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,673
What's new?
It's been done before.

650
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,591
- The guy is a killer.
- Doesn't surprise me.

651
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,750
- He killed my agency.
- He shot two people.

652
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,152
- Who?
- Who? A guy named Parker and Fielding.

653
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,470
- Do I know them?
- Fielding was with me.

654
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,358
- You sent her.
- I don't like this guy one bit...

655
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,798
but just who can I sell this story to
without 50 eyewitnesses?

656
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,950
- How about one?
- You don't count.

657
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:40,793
There's a chance she's still alive.

658
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,519
- Who?
- Fielding. The cops were there.

659
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,511
I'm gonna be looking
for a new government job.

660
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,511
I don't think it will
help my chances...

661
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,239
if I'm the guy that tried to put
our next president in jail.

662
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:53,357
- You think I'm making this up?
- Forget it! You're not going back!

663
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,590
If she's alive, we've got him.

664
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,511
You understand that?
We've got the guy.

665
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,068
We're shut down.
Take a look around. We're history.

666
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,435
Wait, I'm gonna
show you something.

667
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:05,830
You come with me.

668
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,957
Those files are supposed to be sealed.
I don't know why I'm doing this.

669
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,031
You say you were my best friend?

670
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,157
- For a long time.
- I liked you?

671
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,119
- Oh, yeah.
- What are you looking for?

672
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,113
Fielding's friends or family;
anyone she would go to in 1994.

673
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,590
- Who was she?
- I.A., but she had a deal with McComb.

674
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,911
He's got to go back
to be sure she's dead.

675
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,193
Since you say
we were close friends...

676
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,477
I'm gonna ask you a question
the prison psychiatrist will ask you.

677
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,235
making these expeditions into the past
without our equipment, old pal?

678
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:46,552
The prototype was never dismantled.

679
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,633
Kleindast's.
It's in Calverton, Maryland.

680
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,234
Short drive from Washington.

681
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,756
We have no authority
to get in there.

682
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,229
What about Ricky?

683
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,750
If you were my best friend,
you wouldn't do this to me.

684
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,516
I would have had him killed
right here, but if he's back...

685
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,388
he's already told the story to Matuzak.
God knows who else.

686
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,314
They won't get it, but they'll sure
give it thought if he comes up dead.

687
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,198
- Right.
- He'll have to be erased.

688
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,269
Erased.

689
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:25,989
Have him killed
before he joined T.E.C.

690
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,753
That way nobody in the Agency
ever talked to him or even knew him.

691
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:33,356
- Perfect.
- It's not perfect. It's all we've got.

692
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,271
Don't expect to be
my chief of staff...

693
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,191
if slamming you
into the side of the car...

694
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,316
turns you into a sniveling worm.

695
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,191
Well, what do you know?

696
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,034
At random intervals, Maryland Utilities
shows spikes in demand and duration...

697
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,078
- that are almost identical to ours.
- Send me back.

698
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,628
- No, they won't let us do that.
- Stay out of it, Ricky.

699
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,711
Would it be too much trouble
to call me Richard?

700
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,598
Richard, do I have
a best friend around here?

701
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,592
It isn't me.
Maybe Gordon.

702
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,636
Gordon is a putz. I can tell you
who my best friend was...

703
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,551
in school, in the marines,
when I was a cop.

704
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,471
Gordon doesn't fit.
I'm not saying you do...

705
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,869
but since I'd like to see McComb take a
fall, you get the benefit of the doubt.

706
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,758
- Whoa! Where you goin'?
- We've got to vent the fuel shunts.

707
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,513
Oh, is that right? You'll have
to wait while I get authori--

708
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,709
Was I your only friend?

709
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,919
A launch is not
a one-man operation.

710
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,831
Yeah, I know.

711
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,878
If I'm off on velocity or trajectory,
you're gonna be an omelette.

712
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,916
- You trying to scare me?
- Yeah.

713
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,629
- Just hit the right year.
- I'll see ya.

714
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,838
I've had your wife's goulash
a hundred times; always too much salt.

715
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,997
Here goes the pension.

716
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,875
Emergency launch system
on-Iine warning.

717
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,475
Emergency launch system
on-Iine warning.

718
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,749
Manual launch
initiation alert.

719
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,071
Manual launch
initiation alert.

720
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,274
Shut it down! Now!

721
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,797
Telemetry on-Iine.
Ignition firing on-Iine.

722
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,678
- Launch now on hold for--
- Last chance!

723
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,637
Launch is now--

724
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:29,991
- Launch now on hold--

725
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,991
Damn it!

726
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:00,077
Get me the police mainframe computer.

727
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,153
I want all Jane Does admitted
to local hospitals on October 9.

728
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,870
Check if any of the Jane Does
are victims of multiple gunshot wounds.

729
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,831
Gotcha.

730
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,432
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

731
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,318
Dr. Lemon, call line one-five.

732
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,315
Police. Jane Doe.

733
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,032
Happy birthday.

734
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,637
Thanks.
Get me anything?

735
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,518
- Tell me what you want.
- I want to go home.

736
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,036
I already know who's gonna
win the next ten World Series.

737
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,033
- No problem.
- Why'd you come back?

738
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,759
I need you to testify
against McComb.

739
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:34,072
Mmm.
That would be my pleasure.

740
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,390
- It could be dangerous.
- I know that.

741
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:38,869
It's not that simple.
McComb has made some changes.

742
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,192
- You were never in the T.E.C.
- No, that can't be.

743
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,510
I had the training for six years.

744
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,670
- I have friends.
- I've got to move fast.

745
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,355
If I can find you, so can he.

746
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,431
What can I do?

747
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,910
I need proof
that you existed here.

748
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,959
In case I don't
make the trip, huh?

749
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,315
They just took some blood.

750
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,311
It would be in the lab.

751
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:08,710
- I'll be right back.
- Hey.

752
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,630
- I really screwed up.
- Yes, you did.

753
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,790
I want to make things right.

754
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:21,354
You may find you can make
things right for yourself.

755
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,354
I'll be right back.

756
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,956
Wheelchair to Admitting,
please. Wheelchair to Admitting.

757
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:36,278
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

758
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,318
Dr. Ryan,
report to Obstetrics.

759
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:43,148
Nurse Remington,
report to main desk.

760
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,198
Nurse Remington,
report to the main desk.

761
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:33,197
Melissa.

762
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,396
I'm gonna take you
to someplace safe.

763
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:52,399
What are you doing?

764
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:58,708
Help! Security!

765
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:16,435
Help! Security!
Somebody call security!

766
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,469
Help!

767
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,748
Security!
Call security!

768
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,593
Hey! Hold it!
Don't move!

769
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,716
Pictures bring back
your memories.

770
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:20,159
- This is for what you're going to do.
- Hey, wha--

771
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,755
- What the--

772
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,078
- Melissa... don't turn around.
- Why? What's wrong?

773
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,151
It's okay.

774
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:43,198
- Listen. Listen.
- Who are you?

775
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,397
It's me. Look.
It's Max.

776
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,119
Max? Max, what happened?

777
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,317
I can't tell you right now.
We have to go.

778
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,311
Trust me.

779
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,436
Trust me.

780
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,277
Come on.

781
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,631
Let's go.

782
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,640
Here! Here!

783
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,235
Please! Just tell me
what happened to you!

784
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,352
Just try to believe me.
I love you.

785
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,510
Trust me.

786
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,917
- You're not Max.
- It's me.

787
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,877
Ten years from now,
it's me.

788
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,916
- That's not possible.
- Remember:

789
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,596
- Matuzak, the new job, time travel.
- Time travel?

790
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:11,037
If one day I need a birdhouse built,
I know who to talk to.

791
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,476
- Oh, my god.
- It's me. It's Max.

792
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,951
- I can't believe this.
- Try.

793
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,990
What am I like
ten years from now?

794
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,878
Just like now.

795
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:29,918
Perfect.

796
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:35,518
You time traveled,
and what? Why?

797
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,353
Let me show you.

798
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,949
Today you have something
very special to tell him.

799
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,709
- How do you know that?
- I've just told you.

800
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,155
What are you here to prevent?

801
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,038
Changes in the past.

802
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,554
Why? What's gonna happen?

803
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,076
Later. Stay and meet with him.

804
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,151
Don't tell him
anything, please.

805
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,716
There's never enough time.

806
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,629
Never enough for what?

807
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,518
To satisfy a woman.

808
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,068
Then you never want
to miss an opportunity.

809
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:18,197
- Are you busy?
- I'm meeting my husband.

810
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,550
Senator McComb!
Sir!

811
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:35,349
That message came
from the senate operator, sir.

812
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,876
- It's 3:30. You have a 4:00 with--
- Clear my schedule.

813
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:41,918
- All of it.
- Yes, sir.

814
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,754
Kelly, have you ever been
inside the president's limo?

815
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,671
No, sir.

816
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:49,910
You keep in touch.

817
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,991
I'll send you a photograph of it.

818
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,072
I have something I want to tell you.

819
01:11:10,160 --> 01:11:12,958
- Oh, shit.
- Don't answer it.

820
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:17,431
I have to.

821
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:27,829
- Did not tell him?
- He didn't give me a chance.

822
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,674
You should have tried.

823
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,710
Are we still together
in ten years?

824
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,360
Yes, we're together.

825
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,513
- Do you have a picture?
- No, nothing recent.

826
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,752
- Am I dead?
- No. You're not dead.

827
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,751
What about tomorrow?

828
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,479
Everything is going
to be fine, okay?

829
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,792
Why can't we just get out? Why can't we
just run away from whatever it is?

830
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,838
It would come back
as many times as it takes.

831
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,797
It has to end tonight.

832
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,593
Hurry!
Keep him upstairs.

833
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:10,638
Whatever you do,
keep him upstairs.

834
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:13,871
Just do what I say.
Please! Go!

835
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,034
Max, I don't want you to go.

836
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,554
I'll be back soon.

837
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,950
I-- I'm pregnant.

838
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,669
- Great.
- I love you.

839
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:56,549
- Surprise.
- Who the fuck are you?

840
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,598
Friend of the family.

841
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,079
Don't go down!

842
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,518
Upstairs.

843
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,397
- How did you miss him?
- He knew it was comin'.

844
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,072
It was a T.E.C. cop.

845
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,196
Son of a bitch
doesn't know how to die.

846
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,679
He'll learn tonight.

847
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:37,228
You don't kill him,
you don't go back.

848
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,431
Upstairs.

849
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,716
Max.

850
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,040
Oh, my god, Max.
Look out!

851
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,437
You have nothing soft
to land on, do you?

852
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:45,109
Go! Go!

853
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,111
- I'll get
hel
- Go! P!

854
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,431
Say, "Ah."

855
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,393
Oh, shit.

856
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,193
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

857
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,837
Lousy night to be out.

858
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,275
Don't hurt her.

859
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:17,750
You were at a disadvantage
in this from the beginning.

860
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,070
I'm an ambitious
Harvard-educated visionary...

861
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,549
who deserves to be
the most powerful man in the world...

862
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,791
and you, you're a fuckin' idiot
who never figured out...

863
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,429
that the only way to make anything of
all that fancy kicking is on Broadway.

864
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,158
Thanks for clearing that up.

865
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,117
The polls have me winning
by 28 points.

866
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:35,839
That's the biggest landslide
since Nixon back in '72.

867
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,879
I find it reassuring to know
what the future holds, don't you?

868
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,951
That's C-4.

869
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:46,591
It'll turn this house into dust
and also separate every part of you...

870
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,672
- from every other part of you.
- Let her go. You've got me.

871
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,150
I don't want you.
Agent Walker is too visible.

872
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:58,394
But Officer Walker, dead,
is just another D.C. statistic.

873
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,597
When he's gone,
you're gone.

874
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,511
Get the younger one.
I want him to see this.

875
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,591
- He's dead.
- No, he's not, you moron.

876
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:08,478
If he were dead,
he would not be here. Get him.

877
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:11,597
Let her go!

878
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,237
- What do you want?
- You're a bright boy.

879
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,470
Why don't you sleep on it?

880
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:24,471
I did that.

881
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,989
It's different
than before, isn't it?

882
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:05,832
It's what happens
when you change time.

883
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:09,595
Lines of confluence,
probability scales, all that shit.

884
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:14,118
Put your gun
on the floor.

885
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:17,158
What were you gonna do? Shoot me?

886
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,237
A bomb is gonna go off any second now.
You know what happens then?

887
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,437
We're all gonna be dead.
I'm gonna win by default.

888
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:27,636
My young self
is still gonna be president...

889
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,153
and you can't save your wife.

890
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,674
Just like you couldn't
save her once before.

891
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:34,228
She died because you came back
and made some changes.

892
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,629
Now you're gonna
fuck with time.

893
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,713
- You're as bad as me.
- Wrong. I'm setting it right.

894
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,470
Usually I hate doing things
more than once...

895
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,630
but in this case,
I don't see any other option.

896
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,950
I do.

897
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,673
What the fuck are you doing here?

898
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:56,320
You called me. You left a message
with the senate operator.

899
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:59,392
I didn't leave any message,
you fucking idiot!

900
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,596
Don't argue among yourself.
I left it.

901
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,114
Now nobody's got a future.

902
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:08,158
Okay.
This is a real mess now.

903
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:10,356
I hope you're happy.
This is a real mess.

904
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:13,079
You turned a simple, ordinary murder
into a bloodbath.

905
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:19,119
You get out of here. Get out of here.
Go! Now! Go!

906
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:26,238
- You two should be closer.
- Keep him away from me.

907
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,151
The same matter
can't occupy the same space.

908
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,676
I'm still kicking.
I must be on Broadway.

909
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:33,716
No!

910
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,671
Coordinates downloaded
to G.P.S. sequencer.

911
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,751
Re-entry sequence
is completed.

912
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:22,799
Launch bay alert
is now terminated.

913
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:50,360
Hey, where you goin'?

914
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,036
- What happened to you?
- What are you talkin' about?

915
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:57,111
You're walking around.

916
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,069
I've been doing that since I was
about two. Does that seem abnormal?

917
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:11,832
- What's going on with Senator McComb?
- Senator McComb?

918
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,037
If you want time off, ask. Don't act
like you're out of your head.

919
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,556
- I've got a blank spot.
- You've got a hole in your head.

920
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,916
Ten years ago, McComb left his office,
canceled all his appointments...

921
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,036
disappeared,
nobody's ever seen him since.

922
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,112
That's so sad.
I-I-I remember.

923
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:33,191
What are you hangin' around for?

924
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,997
Database 309, shut down.

925
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,758
Secondary system team
to back storage.

926
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,037
This time,
stay away from trouble.

927
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,076
Do I know you?

928
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,152
I guess not.

929
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,031
Hey! Bobby Morgan is still
waiting for a second chance.

930
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,596
- Destination, please.
- Home.

931
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,151
Dad!

932
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,115
Dad, Mom said you'd
barbecue hot dogs.

933
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,077
Yeah.

934
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,119
- What kind of day did you have?
- Busy.

935
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,237
You all right?

936
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,909
Great.

937
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,911
Good.

938
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,991
Come here.

939
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,071
I have something
to tell you.

940
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,311
Take your time.
I'm not going anywhere.

941
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:24,351
I can't wait forever

942
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:31,590
Even though you want me to

943
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,990
I can't wait forever

944
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:44,355
To know if you'll be true

945
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,398
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

946
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:50,597
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

947
01:30:50,680 --> 01:30:53,752
Time won't let me

948
01:30:56,920 --> 01:30:59,115
Wait that long

949
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:15,877
Can't you see
I've waited too long

950
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:22,274
To love you and hold you
in my arms

951
01:31:22,360 --> 01:31:28,515
I can't wait forever

952
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:34,596
Even though you want me to

953
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,797
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

954
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:40,952
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

955
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:44,237
Time won't let me

956
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,559
I can't wait forever

957
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,672
Even though you want me to

958
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:36,232
I can't wait forever

959
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,356
To know if you'll be true

960
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,957
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

961
01:32:47,040 --> 01:32:50,157
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

962
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:53,437
Time won't let me

963
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:58,949
Wait that long

964
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,477
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

965
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,518
Time won't let me
Whoa, no

966
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:24,797
Time won't let me

967
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:31,748
Time won't let me

968
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:37,118
Wait that long

969
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:40,317
Wait that long

970
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:43,836
I'm comin' home, I'm comin' home
I hear you talkin' to you, baby

971
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,196
Gotta get you back inside of my arms

972
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:50,238
Oh pretty baby, won't you listen to me
Can't you tell how much I need you

973
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,596
Can't you tell my love is so strong

974
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:56,990
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
