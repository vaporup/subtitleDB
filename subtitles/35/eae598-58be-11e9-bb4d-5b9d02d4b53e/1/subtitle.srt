1
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,270
The WHO held an emergency conference on the 3rd

2
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,270
Note: WHO stands for World Health Organization.

3
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,810
concerning ACIS, Acquired Cellular Induration Syndrome,

4
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,950
more commonly known as Medusa.

5
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,360
The cause, among other details, is still unclear.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,730
If no actions are taken, apart from the possibility of global political unrest,

7
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,850
this will be recognized as a S-class epidemic.

8
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,850
Note: S refers to those are susceptible to the infection.

9
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,020
The WHO has advised each nation to focus on keeping the peace by implementing physical measures

10
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,080
as well as making information available to the public.

11
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,800
...kind of chemical substance, you see.

12
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,170
When infected with ACIS, we've confirmed that

13
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,070
a large quantity of it is generated inside the body.

14
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,260
By measuring this quantity, the presence of infection

15
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,210
can be determined.

16
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,310
However, the cure aside,

17
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,210
the cause hasn't even been determined yet.

18
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,240
In the first stage, 30 to 60 days pass from infection to onset.

19
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,970
Only a short time period of 12 hours passes until death,

20
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,400
or petrification, occurs at the end of the second stage.

21
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,720
The mortality rate is 100%.

22
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,580
Unfortunately, the only information we have at the moment

23
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,720
is still limited to simple statistics.

24
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,310
All over the country, people are in fear of becoming infected,

25
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,370
attempting to flee the country only to be held up at the borders as refugees.

26
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,250
The government has begun discussion on plans to strengthen the border patrol as well as mobilize the country's armed forces.

27
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,660
The air raid on the 20th has been claimed as

28
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,240
an unavoidable act of self-defence against the country itself,

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,840
thereby justifying the preemptive strike.

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,590
The United Nations Security Council has established

31
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,850
a temporary council regarding this matter.

32
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,730
Due to the closing of factories and companies

33
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,060
accompanied by the significant loss of the workforce,

34
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,770
corporate earnings are down all across the board.

35
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,440
Stock prices continue to fall at a drastic rate,

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,830
resulting in a recorded -47% deficit compared to last year.

37
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,200
The United Nations Security Council has unanimously voted

38
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
to declare this a state of emergency.

39
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,580
They are conducting expert panels at paced intervals...

40
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,320
Large chemical manufacturer Venus Gate and their CEO Vega

41
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,050
are holding a press conference at the company headquarters.

42
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,380
He announced the launch of an astonishing project.

43
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,050
In response to humanity's greatest and unprecedented crisis,

44
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:09,360
one company has gone beyond the call of social responsibility.

45
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,240
On the behalf of that company, I unveil our secret project.

46
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,330
We call it...

47
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,060
Cold sleep.

48
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,850
You mean to suggest that Medusa... no, ACIS,

49
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,740
is most likely an act of bioterrorism launched by Venus Gate?

50
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,030
Yes.

51
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,700
This sudden claim of yours is difficult to believe.

52
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,920
While Venus Gate is an important 
chemical manufacturer for our country

53
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,000
as well as a well connected corporate ally,

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,090
these past couple of years, they have not made any announcements regarding actual products.

55
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,430
Meanwhile, they have been gathering samples of biological species from all over the world,

56
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:48,140
storing them in their corporate facilities.

57
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,610
These would be the cold sleep centers they unveiled?

58
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,640
On the outside, yes.

59
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:56,480
On the inside is a heavily fortified and guarded structure,

60
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,360
an armored fortress if you will.

61
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:05,010
However, the other party is, as you've stated,
an important and distinguished chemical manufacturer.

62
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,620
All of the significant political powers receive a large amount of donations from them.

63
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,410
Venus Gate's current major stockholder is a 
religious cult thought to have been disbanded.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,290
So this center is supposed to be their Noah's Ark?

65
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,930
Also, CEO Vega used to be a distinguished officer in charge of investigating scientific affairs

66
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,840
for the former Russian Ministry of Domestic Affairs.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,700
However, due to a certain thoughtless remark he made,

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,260
he was dismissed.

69
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,890
And the thoughtless remark was?

70
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,400
"I was chosen... to find the path God has laid out."

71
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,610
The drop in metabolism brought on by cold sleep

72
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,650
slows the progression of the disease.

73
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,610
Our company's research has proven this

74
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,120
to be effective against ACIS.

75
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,090
While temporarily asleep, our patients will embark on a journey

76
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,990
towards the day when a cure is discovered.

77
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,350
We have no time to spare.

78
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,590
According to analysis from our intelligence departments,

79
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,090
the commencement of their cold sleep center operation will coincide with their next course of action.

80
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,760
In other words, we have concluded that there is a high possibility
that this very event is the second stage of their terrorist acts.

81
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,110
We won't have another chance to strike or defend if we let this opportunity go.

82
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,060
Is the President aware of this?

83
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,850
The President passed away at 1206 hours.

84
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,490
His cause of death was Medusa.

85
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,580
Please make your decision.

86
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,610
Unfortunately, the center's capacity is limited to only 160 people.

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,960
In the event that the number of candidates increases, we will hold a lottery.

88
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,130
Then what will you call the operation?

89
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,190
Sleeping Beauty.

90
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,140
Once upon a time, in a land far away...

91
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,060
there were a King and Queen with a close relationship,

92
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,080
but they were not happy.

93
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,520
The two of them were unable to 
conceive a child for the longest time.

94
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,910
The doctors and magicians were of no use.

95
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,280
Their servants and citizens pitied them.

96
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,240
Each day, they prayed to the heavens.

97
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,680
One day, a frog appeared in front of the Queen while she was bathing and said the following.

98
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,670
''Your wish shall be granted.''

99
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,710
''The heavens shall bless you with a child.''

100
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,380
But the strangest part was to come.

101
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,740
And what could that be?

102
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,230
As foretold, the Queen gave birth 
at last to a cute, baby girl.

103
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:47,110
The King was overjoyed and 
threw a celebratory banquet.

104
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,820
He invited not only his relatives...

105
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,670
but a great number of the country's citizens and foreign guests to the castle as well.

106
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,690
Even specially invited guests came.

107
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,710
Look! Look, Kasumi!

108
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:04,920
It's a castle.

109
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,020
Hey, Shizuku.

110
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,720
On second thought, let's go home.

111
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,180
Geez, how many times does this 
make since we got here?

112
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,020
It'll be fine.

113
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,510
You've got nothing to worry about.

114
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,190
That's not what...

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,060
The 13 witches had special powers.

116
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,150
Their blessings would ensure the small princess a future.

117
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,820
That's Sleeping Beauty, right?

118
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,860
That story.

119
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:44,960
That's right. Your parental authority no longer covers him.

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,250
He's entitled to his rights.

121
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,130
I submitted an application on his behalf, and he was selected.

122
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,110
I got a new event!

123
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,810
Quit that.

124
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,140
You guys always follow the same pattern anyway.

125
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,060
You probably want to ask how I'm feeling right now.

126
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,230
Oh fine.

127
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,240
Film the scenery.

128
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,030
Got that?

129
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,530
What, not gonna film us?

130
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,790
We finally got to go on a field trip, so I tagged along.

131
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,250
Not even one commemorative photo?

132
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,330
Keep quiet!

133
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,710
Ouch!

134
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:36,130
But how could this have happened?

135
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:43,520
Of the royal tables specially prepared for the special guests, there were only 12 in total.

136
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,140
The 13th village has entered the hall.

137
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,370
Welcome to the Cold Sleep Capsule Center.

138
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,450
In a moment, representatives from our company will come to guide you.

139
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,330
For the moment, please stay where you are.

140
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,850
We have prepared anything you may need.

141
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,790
Please feel free to use any of the facilities.

142
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,190
BNN here, how do you feel at the moment?

143
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,290
Ah, BNN here!

144
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,890
Excuse me, BNN here. How do you feel...

145
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,980
Hey, Shizuku.

146
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,120
This again?

147
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,370
Excuse me.

148
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,630
BNN here. How do you feel at the moment?

149
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,470
Please stop.

150
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,280
The rest area for accompanying guests is this way.

151
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,800
If you are not feeling well, please raise your left hand, and someone will guide you to a rest area.

152
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,180
Should I get some of the scenery?

153
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,220
Excuse me...

154
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,720
Yes! How do you feel at the moment?

155
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,050
Never been better!

156
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,010
Are you getting this?

157
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,710
Yeah.

158
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,590
Welcome.

159
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,340
Yeah, nice meeting ya.

160
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,210
Come on.

161
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,840
Please proceed to the front reception desk.

162
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,630
Please do not stop and continue forward.

163
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,060
Next person please.

164
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,220
Welcome to the Cold Sleep Capsule Center.

165
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,550
The candidate Kasumi Ishiki and her 
accompanying guest Shizuku Ishiki, correct?

166
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,270
Yes.

167
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,630
Please put out your left hand.

168
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,840
KHM050.

169
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,820
This is your ID number.

170
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,890
Only those with this bracelet on 
may proceed any further inside.

171
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,140
Make sure you do not remove it.

172
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,370
Excuse me...

173
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,190
The orientation will be held in the chapel in 30 minutes.

174
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,370
Please make haste.

175
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,880
This way please.

176
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,410
I shall show you the way.

177
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,110
Shizuku.

178
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:06,740
It'll be okay.

179
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,530
I'm visiting after all.

180
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,330
When the 11th witch finished her blessings,

181
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,920
the 13th witch, convinced that she had 
been ignored, said this to the 12th witch.

182
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,250
''On the Princess's 15th birthday, she will be pricked by a spindle and die.''

183
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,550
Those were the terrifying words of a curse.

184
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Alright.

185
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,020
With the formalities out of the way, does anyone have any questions?

186
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,400
Then if I may?

187
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,020
Go ahead.

188
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,290
If while we're asleep...

189
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,760
I'm not sure if I should say this...

190
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,930
Feel free to continue.

191
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,070
What if the facility staff here die from Medusa?

192
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,950
I see. I fully understand your point of concern.

193
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,030
Then if I may introduce to you...

194
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,650
Our state of the art master control system...

195
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,790
ALICE!

196
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,930
This system oversees not only the 
underground cold sleep capsule room

197
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:14,600
but also has the ability to permanently maintain the castle and the surrounding facilities.

198
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,350
According to our calculations, 
its functional capabilities will last...

199
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,180
Over 100 years!

200
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,730
100 years?

201
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:24,580
However...

202
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,190
The 12th witch stepped forward and said the following.

203
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,990
"The curse cast on the Princess cannot be broken."

204
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,700
"Instead, she will sleep on for 100 years."

205
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,410
"And so shall the poison fade away."

206
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,950
"Leave the rest to one pure of heart."

207
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,130
Now concerning the bracelets we had you wear before coming into the center...

208
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,140
Even now, ALICE is registering those of you with bracelets on,

209
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:59,520
carefully monitoring your physical and mental status, even your current surroundings.

210
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:11,400
ALICE records your individual data as well as biological data such as genetic information.

211
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,370
This is all backed up and stored 
in a massive data bank.

212
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,450
Please leave everything to ALICE 
and sleep with peace of mind.

213
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,500
May I ask something?

214
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,890
What might that be?

215
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,810
I'm Bridget from BNN.

216
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,880
Do you dream during cold sleep?

217
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,100
Quite an interesting question.

218
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,110
And a good one at that.

219
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,340
Please do not worry.

220
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,860
It's even possible for ALICE to control all your dreams.

221
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,060
To be specific, it deals with the pattern of electrical currents emitted from the brain.

222
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,980
Furthermore, by using an original algorithm to make modifications, we can generate feedback...

223
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,330
Ah.

224
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,530
Well, let's leave the technicalities aside.

225
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,570
Take comfort in your dreams.

226
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,040
I guarantee that you can look forward to your journey to a future, developed world.

227
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,010
It's about time.

228
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,860
I have one last thing to explain.

229
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,100
The bracelet everyone is wearing.

230
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,610
This not only accepts ALICE's commands, but it also contains another function.

231
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,320
The white part in the center.

232
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,390
This part indicates the progression of the disease.

233
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,510
If by any chance your Medusa advances to stage 2, this part will turn blac-

234
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,640
AHH!

235
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,770
No!

236
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,740
No, no!

237
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,240
NO!

238
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
NO, NO!!!

239
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,690
NO!

240
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,160
Doctor, hurry to the chapel.

241
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,920
There's still time... for me to leave.

242
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,960
I am dreadfully sorry for the disruption.

243
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,710
Well then, it is time.

244
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,980
100 years in the castle?

245
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,810
It's like you're a real sleeping beauty in a forest.

246
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,910
Even you're saying that Shizuku...

247
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:19,370
In the fairytale, her family and servants were put to sleep too, but I...

248
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,460
God doesn't exist, does he?

249
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
But if he does, he's just a wicked mage.

250
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,500
Kasumi.

251
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,000
But isn't that true? Dad and Mom 
died, and now even you...

252
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,840
Kasumi.

253
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,460
Didn't we promise?

254
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,130
That the two of us would be together forever?

255
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,550
That we'd live on together?

256
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,510
Kasumi, it's not like I'm going to die for sure.

257
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,710
Sorry.

258
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,890
I'm acting strange.

259
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,530
Kasumi, here's part two of our promise.

260
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,390
I'll always be waiting for you, Kasumi.

261
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,250
When you wake up, come looking for me right away.

262
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,920
I'm sure we'll meet again.

263
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,470
Miracles don't happen without wishes.

264
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,930
Because the 12th witch wished it so, 
the princess didn't die and continued to sleep.

265
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,970
If I wish, a miracle will happen...

266
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,080
Yeah, it will for sure.

267
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,220
I really can't...

268
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,230
You may not bring personal effects inside the capsule.

269
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,440
Leave everything in the custody of the center.

270
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,750
Your possessions will be returned once you exit cold sleep.

271
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,080
What? Isn't this the same as prison then?

272
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:05,090
You are only permitted to bring glasses or hearing aids into the capsules.

273
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,510
Will you really give this back to me?

274
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,470
You have my word.

275
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,980
Mrs. Turner.

276
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,050
It's a memento of my late husband.

277
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,650
I'm afraid you can't.

278
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,410
I'm...

279
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,340
That's right...

280
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm...

281
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,000
Each time I look in the mirror, 
I'm sure I'll remember you.

282
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,450
You have the same face as me.

283
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,030
You, my older sister.

284
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:49,800
And when I turn 20, you'll be 20...

285
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,320
Ouch!

286
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,260
And when I turn 40, you'll be 40...

287
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,580
I welcome you all once more.

288
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,770
While this is the last stop on our trip of the center, 
it is the starting point of the future!

289
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,230
Now, we shall cast off Noah's Ark.

290
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,570
Glory to your future... to mankind's future!

291
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,230
Please go ahead.

292
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,350
Ah, please leave your glasses in that sidetray.

293
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,730
When I turn 20, you'll be 20...

294
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,780
When I turn 40, you'll be 40...

295
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,570
When I turn 100, you'll be 100...

296
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,740
And I can see you then.

297
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,990
Hello, my name is ALICE.

298
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,200
I will be taking care of you.

299
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,760
There's nothing to be afraid of.

300
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,630
Relax and count the numbers along with me.

301
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:58,940
1...

302
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,290
2...

303
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,450
3...

304
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,600
4...

305
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:02,780
4...

306
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:03,630
5...

307
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,850
5...

308
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,080
6...

309
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,680
6...

310
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,110
7...

311
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,990
Good night.

312
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,180
Maintenance code KHM050, Kasumi Ishiki.

313
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,990
Sweet dreams.

314
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
So Shizuku...

315
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,970
Kasumi.

316
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,320
Live.

317
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:07,900
Ow.

318
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,090
What is this?

319
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,390
What the?

320
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,680
Hey, what's happening?

321
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
They found the cure!

322
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,440
Did they really?

323
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,230
Ouch.

324
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,320
What is this here?

325
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,130
Grass? Maybe vines?

326
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,030
Be careful. It has thorns.

327
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,910
What in the world is going on?

328
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,370
What year is it now?

329
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,040
What's wrong?

330
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,210
How many years have passed since then?

331
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,620
Like I know!

332
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,650
Hello? Hello?

333
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,670
Are there no Venus Gate officials here!?

334
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,680
Hey, someone collapsed over here!

335
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,660
Hey you, are you okay?

336
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,640
Hey! Hey!

337
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,300
NO!

338
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,450
What's wrong?

339
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,630
The birds!

340
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,830
The elevator!

341
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:50,980
Run towards the elevator!

342
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,580
To the elevator!

343
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,730
I'm sorry!

344
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:17,580
Are you okay?

345
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,850
Wow.

346
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,620
Come on, what are you doing?

347
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,760
Death bats. They're small sized monsters!

348
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,900
I could take them all out if I could cast wind ruin magic.

349
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,830
Hurry it along.

350
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,470
Hurry! Hurry and open it!

351
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,420
This damn elevator!

352
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,830
Calm down! Just calm down!

353
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,260
Everyone calm down!

354
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Wait!

355
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,650
Women and children go first!

356
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,100
Why them!?

357
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,980
Out of my way!

358
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,460
Damn!

359
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,240
Please save me!

360
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,340
Hurry!

361
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,310
Quickly!

362
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,470
Don't!

363
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,870
We're gonna die if you open that!

364
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,660
Yo!

365
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,360
No getting ahead of us, got that amigo?

366
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,650
Everyone, over here!

367
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:26,530
Go!

368
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,170
That's a lot of blood... are you okay?

369
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,260
Ah. This is someone else's blood.

370
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:48,080
In the end, only seven people survived.

371
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,170
No, maybe seven people.

372
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:52,080
Give it a rest already.

373
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,020
What did you say?

374
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,340
Ugh, this is why I hate class pres-

375
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,870
I'm a police officer!

376
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,940
Yeah, up until the world ended.

377
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,410
Take a look at our situation.

378
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:08,160
No matter how you think about it, there's no way all this happened in a short amount of time!

379
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,200
That's true.

380
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,280
Those monsters.

381
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,410
I know them!

382
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,290
Level 1 monsters, death bats!

383
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,710
Huh?

384
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,250
He's talking about a game... I guess.

385
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,590
That's garbage.

386
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:27,340
Some kind of lifeform probably evolved 
or underwent some unexpected mutation...

387
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,800
Wait a second... nothing can evolve that quick...

388
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,470
Exactly.

389
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,690
Like I've been saying... the world has ended, got it?

390
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:46,350
Just how many months and years have we been asleep?

391
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:51,480
Oh, right! Didn't they say that ALICE thing was supposed to protect us in times like this?

392
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,080
What happened to ALICE? ALICE!

393
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,500
Fool.

394
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,240
Contacting someone comes first.

395
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,250
Right! The phone, find a phone!

396
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,750
Already called.

397
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,610
Huh?

398
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,630
They don't accept collect calls.

399
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,800
You keep doing things off on your own!

400
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,970
Just trying to lift the mood!

401
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,480
Shut up, bastard!

402
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,150
The hell are you so pissed off at?

403
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:14,350
Same goes to you!

404
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,890
P... please stop!

405
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,140
Don't you think you're acting pathetic in front of the children at a time like this?

406
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,480
Okay, okay, Mama.

407
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:35,580
I already tried calling too. 
It was the first thing I did.

408
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,020
But...

409
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,770
Those monsters aren't the only thing threatening our lives.

410
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:58,770
And we... can no longer return to the capsules.

411
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,850
What do we do?

412
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,560
Isn't it obvious? We have to go up.

413
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,250
Up?

414
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:09,780
This place is underground, so there's nowhere to go but up.

415
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,030
Wait, how can we be sure that the surface is safe?

416
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,240
We can't.

417
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,360
But you know, staying here isn't safe either.

418
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,200
Is it that disgusting monster?

419
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,140
That was a Hellworm!

420
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,370
Let's go up.

421
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,230
Don't order me around!

422
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:31,130
Hey, I'm not going. I'm staying put!

423
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,470
Feel free to.

424
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,630
But he can't!

425
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,970
There's a possibility we'll all get 
wiped out, and this old guy'll survive.

426
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,430
The opposite goes too.

427
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,430
I'm not an old guy!

428
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,770
I'm a big shot Italian senator, Alessandro Peccino.

429
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,520
Please wait, we really should go togeth-

430
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,780
That guy wants to stay here of his own free will.

431
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,780
We can't do that! I don't want to 
leave anyone else behind.

432
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,410
She's right.

433
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,080
You...

434
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,210
You were with your twin on the bus.

435
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,760
What happened to her?

436
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,930
Shizuku... only came to keep me company.

437
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,040
So...

438
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:21,520
Ah, what a mood killer.

439
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,770
Like I said, we just need to go up and check out what happened to the world!

440
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,520
Check?

441
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,900
We'll see what happened to our loved ones.

442
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,520
Let's go.

443
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,870
Come on, Mr. Senator.

444
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,070
Let's go.

445
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,450
I said I'm not going, so I'm not!

446
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,160
Like I could walk with my feet like this in the first place!

447
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,500
What? What's this?

448
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,280
Copy me and wrap up your feet.

449
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,130
But if you slow us down, 
I'm leaving you behind.

450
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:01,530
I'm leaving the slow ones behind, got that?

451
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:09,350
As the Princess fell asleep, the King, the Queen, and the servants

452
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:14,730
as well as all of the dogs, birds, 
and fish in the garden

453
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,300
drifted deeply into a world of dreams.

454
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,900
Please wait!

455
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:37,520
And in the blink of an eye, large thorns began to wind around the castle.

456
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,460
They fully enveloped it, becoming 
like the forests of yore.

457
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:46,550
Have we met somewhere before?

458
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,060
Hey, is this really the right way?

459
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,980
I've worked in this kind of plant before, so...

460
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,360
So what now, Mr. Engineer?

461
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,620
This is...

462
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,870
I'm afraid that the tank that converts ocean water to coolant is broken.

463
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,630
Damn these Venus Gate bastards. I didn't fork over a huge amount of cash to go through all this!

464
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,880
I'm disgusted. You bought your right to be here?

465
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,380
I only got what's rightfully mine.

466
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,640
Shut up!

467
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:27,720
Damn. If anything happens to the stocks I set aside, I'm gonna sue Venus Gate.

468
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Quiet!

469
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,440
You shut up! Don't order me around!

470
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,170
Don't!

471
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,000
We can't run away!

472
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:56,670
What?

473
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,030
That thing reacts to sounds.

474
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,250
Why do you know that?

475
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,930
It's a level 5 Demonsaurus.

476
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,310
Something else from your game?

477
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:09,390
Its eyes can barely see anything, so that monster relies entirely on its ears.

478
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,730
You sure about that?

479
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,640
My data's never wrong!

480
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,240
Boy!

481
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,750
What are you doing!?

482
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,730
Everyone, jump in!

483
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,020
Boy, boy!

484
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,710
That was seriously reckless.

485
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,330
They're not coming after us?

486
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,430
Yeah.

487
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,650
Didn't I tell you? That thing acts based on sound.

488
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,890
Yeah, yeah.

489
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,240
Where to next?

490
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,320
This way.

491
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:15,370
The security office is over here. 
Let's take refuge there for the time being.

492
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,740
Hey, that girl isn't here.

493
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,590
That slowpoke.

494
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:48,770
Kasumi.

495
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,520
Live.

496
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,250
Ah, here they are!

497
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Damn girl, next time I'm leaving you behind.

498
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,500
I'm sorry.

499
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,120
Come on, let's get going.

500
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,720
Wait.

501
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:15,890
What?

502
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,730
There should be other people around.

503
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,730
Did everyone get killed by that thing?

504
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,760
I don't know.

505
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,270
Don't take the lead if you don't know.

506
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,390
Shut it!

507
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,860
What's got you so on edge?

508
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,650
RUN!

509
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,910
Seriously!?

510
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,180
Get down!

511
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,580
Toss me a gun too!

512
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,520
Hurry!

513
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,610
Quickly!

514
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,770
Finish it off!

515
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:39,270
Get down!

516
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,920
Good going.

517
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,530
Look out!

518
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,740
Bastard.

519
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,010
We did it! Stage 2 clear!

520
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,050
He's no ordinary guy.

521
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,850
Is this stone?

522
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,530
This thing had Medusa?

523
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:31,950
How could that be?

524
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,530
Wasn't Medusa only supposed to infect humans?

525
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,410
An unexpected mutation, huh?

526
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,200
If we consider the amount of time it would take for this thing to be born,

527
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,370
then I fear that the creation of 
a mutant wouldn't be strange.

528
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,320
<i>So that much time has passed...</i>

529
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,950
Perhaps the beings infected with Medusa mutate with it, bearing its characteristics, or...

530
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,710
Or what?

531
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,740
What indeed...

532
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:00,220
You might have 2 or 3 broken ribs 
or maybe just some fractures.

533
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,810
Class 3 damage...

534
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,900
Stop that.

535
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,740
What's this scar?

536
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,310
It's a long story.

537
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,040
I'm all done. Don't push yourself.

538
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,250
It's only a temporary measure.

539
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,650
You're good at this.

540
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,950
Damage sustained, but the adventure continues!

541
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:16,910
Stop it.

542
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,030
I was a nurse after all...

543
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,910
Up until the world ended, of course.

544
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,840
How are things on your end?

545
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,590
Not good. We only keep finding energy data.

546
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,590
Same for me.

547
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,390
But I really wish I could have 
switched out a party member...

548
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,330
Hey now.

549
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,600
A child doesn't add to the party's strength.

550
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:46,640
Stop that!

551
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,300
I wonder if it'd be hard to buy weapons 
after we get a lot of gold.

552
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,980
Would you quit already!?

553
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,520
This is NOT a game!

554
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,450
People are really dying!

555
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,580
Sorry.

556
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,200
I...

557
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:02,370
That look... I hate how you look at me!

558
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,240
Hey.

559
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:05,620
How you stared at and believed me...

560
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,370
That used to drive me crazy!

561
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,830
I'm really sorry.

562
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:10,010
I'm so sorry.

563
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,350
I won't make this a game anymore.

564
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,630
Please don't hit me.

565
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,640
Come on!

566
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:19,880
I'm sorry...

567
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,640
I'm so sorry...

568
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,390
Good grief.

569
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,600
Looks like the people here sure 
have their share of traumas.

570
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,060
Do you really think this is all a coincidence?

571
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:29,900
Huh?

572
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,690
Do you, amigo!?

573
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,570
Why are you asking me?

574
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,530
That's cause you're not a patient.

575
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,530
O... on what basis?

576
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,030
Your pendant.

577
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,120
We weren't allowed to bring personal items inside the capsule, no?

578
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,580
I snuck it in.

579
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,130
They had metal detectors. I saw 
bunches of people get caught.

580
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,880
The truth is I bribed the staff with a little money.

581
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,380
You're a horrible liar.

582
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,680
I'm telling the truth, I'm-

583
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,080
Then why did you tell us to come here first?

584
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:07,930
You bastard.

585
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,520
Don't move!

586
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:16,060
Weren't you the ones who just up and followed me?

587
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,740
I have an important mission to fulfill.

588
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,860
Listen.

589
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,700
You come after me, and this girl dies.

590
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,120
We've no intention of getting in your way, 
so just let the girl go.

591
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,620
4 blocks up ahead, there's a central shaft.

592
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,130
Use the emergency stairs there to get outside.

593
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,570
Got that!?

594
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,520
Damn it!

595
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,480
Why?

596
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,440
I've met you before.

597
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,890
Who... exactly are you?

598
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,070
That bastard's looking down on us.

599
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,480
What are you going to do?

600
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,330
I owe that slowpoke a favor.

601
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:16,750
But above all, there's no doubt that glasses bastard's keeping something secret.

602
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,420
I'm gonna grab and make him talk.

603
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,670
Alright, let's go.

604
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,170
Wait.

605
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,310
It's only been 48 hours since 
we entered the capsules?

606
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,730
Don't be ridiculous!

607
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:37,770
Only 2 days? Then what's with those bizarre monsters, those thorns?

608
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,330
That's why we're gonna ask that-

609
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,810
When did that happen?

610
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:56,670
Right after everyone went into cold sleep.

611
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,430
After I fell asleep...

612
00:44:58,430 --> 00:44:59,470
That was Shizuku.

613
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,300
Shizuku?

614
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,550
My older twin sister.

615
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,800
So she was alive...

616
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:10,660
So Shizuku... where did Shizuku go?

617
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:13,150
She suddenly disappeared.

618
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,200
By the time I noticed-

619
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,310
Oh come on.

620
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:26,560
Damn.

621
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,340
One hell of a sight.

622
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:35,280
What do we do?

623
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,380
We climb.

624
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,540
Hey, you can't be serious.

625
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,210
You can do that, right?

626
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:43,670
Dungeons have this kind of challenge: 
the Labyrinth Tower.

627
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,600
Alright, next up is you.

628
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,560
What did you say!?

629
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,900
What are you trying to pull?

630
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,360
You got something to do, right?

631
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:08,950
Once we get outside, I'm gonna 
knock you a good one.

632
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,520
Come on now...

633
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,710
Don't you dare let go.

634
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,630
Be careful. The Labyrinth Tower 
has a lot of hidden traps.

635
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,100
Don't say such strange things now.

636
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,570
Damn!

637
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:49,990
No other choice... here goes nothing!

638
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,030
Hey, you're not gonna...

639
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:53,140
Bingo!

640
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,520
Damn it!

641
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:16,930
Ah Kasumi, you came today too!

642
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:18,730
Yeah.

643
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,770
Look, I can walk without using the handrails now.

644
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,990
It'll be okay.

645
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,990
I'll definitely get all better.

646
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:31,540
Kasumi?

647
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,500
Shizuku.

648
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:37,120
It's my fault that you didn't get to go to summer camp.

649
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,140
And you're even so far behind in school.

650
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,710
What, just that?

651
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,880
Take care of my study slack, 'kay?

652
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,550
And we'll be even with that.

653
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:49,820
Okay.

654
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,670
Shizuku, pass it over here!

655
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,640
Pass, pass!

656
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,720
Amazing, Shizuku. I knew it was in you!

657
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,730
You couldn't normally make a goal like that!

658
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,480
Why...

659
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,580
Why?

660
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,760
Why!?

661
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,230
WHY!?

662
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,450
Stop that, Kasumi.

663
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,830
But why do the two of us have 
to have the same disease?

664
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:20,870
Why do we have the same one 
that killed Dad and Mom?

665
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,230
Kasumi!

666
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,540
I should have been the only one to get sick!

667
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,520
You can't say such foolish things!

668
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:32,220
The two of us are the only family 
we have left in the world now.

669
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,510
From now on, we'll go at it together.

670
00:48:39,230 --> 00:48:41,110
We used to do this a lot as kids.

671
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,040
It's a promise.

672
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,470
What is this?

673
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:48,130
You first.

674
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,880
Oh, sorry...

675
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:54,120
I never... I never would have 
thought it'd turn out like this.

676
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,260
Calm down.

677
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,470
Sneaking past ALICE's monitoring and 
waking up just one patient is impossible,

678
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,180
so I caused a blackout by temporarily 
switching the power feed.

679
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,000
But about that... something went wrong.

680
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,520
So what happened?

681
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:17,410
At the start of it all, I took some clothes off a corpse and pretended to be a patient.

682
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,510
Hey now.

683
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:23,290
I lost a memory card with information on it then,

684
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,910
so as you as can see, I'm trying 
to finish copying the data.

685
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:31,290
I made it so I could access the memory 
backups from anywhere for times like this.

686
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,760
Keep doing that, amigo. 
I'm going to take a look around.

687
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,120
How come?

688
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,430
Why?

689
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,970
Why!?

690
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,890
You must be wondering why...

691
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:57,190
I was the developer of the cold sleep capsules.

692
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,030
I wanted to prove that my thesis was right.

693
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:06,450
It'd be wonderful if I could save humanity in the process.

694
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,960
Of course, it'd be a lie to say I didn't have the slightest bit of ambition.

695
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:14,590
That's what that fiend took advantage of.

696
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:16,340
Fiend?

697
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:21,050
I'm talking the one sitting on a throne at the top of the castle's tower.

698
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:29,060
What a frightening idea.

699
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,060
Without realizing it, I lent a hand in defying God.

700
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,870
This is a warning from Heaven. Please inform the world of Venus Gate's true nature.

701
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,360
Why?

702
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:51,580
Why can you be so calm?

703
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,880
Everything you'd said is all selfish logic!

704
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:56,540
That's...

705
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:01,130
You gave everyone half-hearted hope, 
but instead you made us fall deeper into despair.

706
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,310
If you had never invented those things, Shizuku and I wouldn't have needed to be apart!

707
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,400
I'll accept my punishment, okay!

708
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:19,070
I'm leaving this to you.

709
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,030
Those who close in on the hidden 
knowledge of Medusa shall triumph.

710
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,330
Don't forget that!

711
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,300
You idiot!

712
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,240
The hell are you doing?

713
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:58,980
Move! Go!

714
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,370
Liar, you liar!

715
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,600
Shizuku!

716
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,370
I've returned the favor with this.

717
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,630
Now it's time for a trade.

718
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:01,460
Hand this over.

719
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,230
I can't.

720
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,340
This isn't something worth risking your life over.

721
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,800
Who are you? Just who!?

722
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,520
Nothing would change even if you knew.

723
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,440
Laura...

724
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,880
Seriously...

725
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,920
You're damn annoying!

726
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:47,440
Hey wai-

727
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,450
You owe me one.

728
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,970
No way!

729
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:23,540
What's with this thing?

730
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,360
Hey, what are you doi...

731
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,990
Damn, it wasn't like this earlier.

732
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,480
Climb up.

733
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,690
Go up!

734
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,820
Go on up!

735
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:45,220
Quickly!

736
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,350
One special capsule for you.

737
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,550
Should I throw down a bottle?

738
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:24,240
Now there's no chance of anyone going after you.

739
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,310
Hurry!

740
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:50,840
Where's this?

741
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:52,740
Boy.

742
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,640
Boy!

743
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,530
You sure seem fine.

744
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,850
What happened to the guy with the necklace?

745
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,850
He was attacked and killed by a monster.

746
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,560
That was a Demonzaurus!

747
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:08,730
Why you!

748
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:14,660
Right before he died, he told me to tell the world about Venus Gate's true nature.

749
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,490
But the proof of that is already...

750
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,850
Who in the world was he?

751
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,370
That person there should know exactly who he is.

752
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:28,380
Idiots.

753
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,750
What did you say!?

754
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,130
Did you plan to wait here to be rescued, drink in hand?

755
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,220
Holed up in this place without any sunlight?

756
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,010
Bastard, who the hell do you think you are?

757
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,380
I belong to the British SAS forces,

758
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:44,100
Note: SAS stands for Special Air Service, a British commando unit.

759
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,090
Second Lieutenant Marco Owen.

760
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,840
I disguised myself as a candidate 
and infiltrated the CSCC.

761
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:53,150
With his help, I was supposed to support the acquisition of information as well as outside covert operations.

762
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,450
What kind of information?

763
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:00,740
Proof that Venus Gate used Medusa as an act of bioterrorism

764
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,450
or clues leading to Medusa's true nature.

765
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,360
So cool! You're like True Commando!

766
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,800
How could that be...

767
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,210
Don't suddenly say something out of a movie...

768
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:17,960
I already thought that this epidemic and cold sleep was something out of a dream.

769
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,380
And now this?

770
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,660
I was better off believing it was a dream.

771
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,330
You knew everything and followed us around, laughing behind our backs!

772
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,810
Even if you do know something,

773
00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:39,330
it's not going to change our situation.

774
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:42,650
Do we turn to stone and die or do we get eaten by monsters?

775
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:44,080
It's all your fault.

776
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:47,300
It's not. This situation is irregular.

777
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,620
What are you gonna do?

778
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:53,160
I'm just going to carry out my mission... the capture of Venus Gate's leader.

779
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,210
You're still...

780
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:59,430
Whether or not he had something to do with Medusa's origin, he still isn't infected.

781
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:01,600
He must be holding on to some secret.

782
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:02,800
Secret?

783
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,100
Medusa's cure.

784
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:08,890
That person said something to me before he died.

785
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,340
"Those who close in on the hidden 
knowledge of Medusa shall triumph."

786
00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:18,360
Another monster?

787
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:19,820
No, it's an earthquake.

788
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,220
The door!

789
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:36,760
A monster?

790
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,840
That lizard thing again?

791
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,220
You mean Demonsaurus.

792
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:45,010
Let it in. I'll finish it off with a single shot.

793
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,180
Wait, this...

794
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,350
What's wrong?

795
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,520
This might be a human!

796
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,360
This person is...

797
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,740
Mr. Vega!

798
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,050
Don't shoot.

799
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,740
Please don't shoot.

800
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:11,040
Don't.

801
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,040
Mr. Owen!

802
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:16,960
It's Marco!

803
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,710
Are you okay?

804
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,660
What happened?

805
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:27,890
What's the outside like?

806
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:30,290
The subject went out of control.

807
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,520
I can no longer handle this.

808
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,620
No... this has gone far beyond my power.

809
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,870
An experiment?

810
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,360
What experiment?

811
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:41,950
You could call it an experiment 
done to turn dreams into reality.

812
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,850
We were so close, and then we were interrupted.

813
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:48,690
It's a big one.

814
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:56,170
The coolant's flooded up to here?

815
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:58,920
This...

816
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:00,120
It's ocean water!

817
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:11,560
Hey you!

818
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,070
You didn't come running here by chance.

819
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,260
There must have been a reason.

820
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,800
It's the final dungeon.

821
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:48,890
Is this exit part of a dream?

822
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,260
Is it real?

823
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,180
You go first. Don't try anything funny.

824
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:03,070
This happened 8 years ago.

825
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:09,760
Right after that, an unknown disease had wiped out a nearby village,

826
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,540
except for a young girl.

827
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:14,540
Medusa... Medusa came from space?

828
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,790
We included that possibility in our hypothesis.

829
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:22,710
The problem was the odd creature that appeared in the village around the same time.

830
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:23,510
Odd creature?

831
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:36,690
My subordinates disposed of 
that creature after a bloody battle.

832
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:41,900
Larrue!

833
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:49,730
That creature was far stranger than any creature that ever walked this earth.

834
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,220
Strange how?

835
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:56,780
To put it simply, you could say it was taken from fiction or just... nonsense.

836
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:03,200
As I continued my investigation, I concluded it was born from the little girl's imagination.

837
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,510
A dream? Are you saying that her dream became reality?

838
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:19,230
It'd be more correct to say something acted as a catalyst and brought her imagination into being.

839
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,230
Something? You can't mean...

840
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:25,730
The unknown disease, the girl, and the odd creature had an intertwined relationship.

841
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:34,740
The girl was infected with Medusa, but by giving birth to an alternative, she survived Medusa.

842
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,750
Medusa has existed in space far, far 
before the birth of humanity.

843
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:46,520
It was an existence that intervened with the higher mental functioning of organisms, hastening their evolution.

844
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,640
That's just...

845
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:51,510
The only one in the entire world 
who realized that was me.

846
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:55,310
But why? This was worthy to be 
considered a gift from the heavens!

847
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,370
Why did the lifeform evolve?

848
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:04,770
It did because it wished to evolve! 
Because it could imagine its evolved form!

849
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,610
Our fate was decided as soon as 
Medusa landed on this planet.

850
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:14,200
No one can escape from 
the trial that was given to us!

851
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,720
Unbeknown to them, humanity is 
being played for a fool.

852
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:20,790
I thought about taking control of that.

853
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:26,970
The human consciousness is already full of noise caused by outside stimuli.

854
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,800
Using willpower alone to focus 
the mind is close to impossible.

855
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,690
Without an immense amount of 
concentration and as long as reason prevails,

856
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:56,160
we cannot remain immersed
 in the realm of imagination.

857
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:00,860
I do feel very sorry to Alice.

858
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:06,340
The feelings she had when she stiffly squeezed the hand I held out...

859
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:12,050
The feelings she held in during those repeated experiments with not even a single complaint...

860
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,050
Why didn't I realize them?

861
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:26,380
I wanted to atone for her sacrifice.

862
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:36,170
I went for one last gamble.

863
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,620
He's gone.

864
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:47,410
That is... I gathered subjects with great potential from all over the world and hastened the evolution with one go.

865
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,370
The cold sleep center!

866
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,880
You said you could control our dreams during cold sleep.

867
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,970
However, that all went to those fools!

868
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:00,060
Powerful nations are always like that!

869
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,770
They never reflect on their foolishness.

870
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:07,350
They think of it as their natural right to take and learn the fruits of others!

871
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,990
Right after the cold sleep capsules were activated...

872
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,990
A girl was carried into the lab.

873
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:23,750
What irony! What a coincidence!

874
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:28,040
Although that girl was not one of the candidates,

875
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,960
she was the second compatible 
user I had been searching for.

876
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,090
Could that have been...

877
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,470
She had fearsome abilities of propagation.

878
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:44,470
Something had triggered her 
mind to go out of control.

879
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:47,770
Exactly what kind of emotions 
could have possibly caused that?

880
01:06:58,010 --> 01:06:58,730
What's wrong?

881
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,960
ALICE's systems have shutdown.

882
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,050
Find out why right away!

883
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:14,250
What came free from ALICE's mental control was an endless rampage.

884
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:19,760
Even if ALICE's systems were down,

885
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,010
you should've been able to stop the compatible 
user's rampage by cutting the main power line!

886
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,680
Why didn't you? You should have been able to!

887
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:31,570
I couldn't...

888
01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:36,880
Ever since Alice, I kept having failure 
after failure for the longest time.

889
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,150
But at last...

890
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:41,200
At last, the ultimate materials had appeared!

891
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:49,530
An alternative born from a compatible user will not be infected by Medusa again.

892
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,630
They wouldn't live forever, 
but they would be near immortal.

893
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,710
Please remember that we were 
the beginning of everything.

894
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:00,880
That's right.

895
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,450
We are humans who heard God's voice!

896
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:04,680
Stop!

897
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:18,030
I owe you another favor.

898
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:21,490
I won't let anyone else die.

899
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:25,490
Where is that girl? Please take me there.

900
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,670
Boy.

901
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,010
Boy!

902
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,720
BOY!

903
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:46,070
Idiot!

904
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:57,870
Boy!

905
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,820
BOY!

906
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,600
Go! This one's fallen for me.

907
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,210
Bastard, going at it alone again?

908
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:21,420
Go!

909
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,810
Only that kid knows the way out now!

910
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:24,940
Let's go.

911
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,300
Mr. Owen!

912
01:09:27,610 --> 01:09:28,680
It's Marco!

913
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,280
What's the matter?

914
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:46,080
With those steps, the Prince won't invite you to dance!

915
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:52,040
Later, honey!

916
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:18,480
Sorry...

917
01:10:19,110 --> 01:10:19,960
Laura.

918
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:32,290
You...

919
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,040
I made up my mind to not abandon anyone else.

920
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,750
I won't turn my back on them.

921
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:43,500
I know.

922
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,880
I owe that girl one after all.

923
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,730
Boy!

924
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:10,340
Boy! It was my fault.

925
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:12,910
Mama won't hit you anymore, 
so please don't leave me alone.

926
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:16,160
God, please don't take my child away from me.

927
01:11:32,910 --> 01:11:33,840
Boy!

928
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:44,770
Mr. Owen!

929
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,590
It's Marco!

930
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,570
Is he... what happened to him?

931
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:53,030
Chief Officer Ron Portman died in the line of duty.

932
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:56,800
What? Was there an accident in our schedule course?

933
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,500
ALICE.

934
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:06,050
You invaded that kid's mind during cold sleep, didn't you?

935
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,140
Why are you helping us?

936
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,270
That can't...

937
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:11,510
He's under her control.

938
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:15,760
My purpose is to protect the lives of the candidates.

939
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:17,560
Boy!

940
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:18,900
Oh?

941
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,860
Boy!

942
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:21,640
The spell's broken.

943
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:23,030
But...

944
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:25,000
Why would she do that?

945
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,190
Why take over that boy?

946
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,220
At this rate...

947
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,090
We'll jump in.

948
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:36,870
That's crazy!

949
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:39,410
If we jump in, we'll rise to the surface for sure!

950
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:40,510
It doesn't matter what...

951
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:42,460
Just grab onto something that's floating!

952
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:44,190
Are you serious?

953
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,750
You can go, right Tim?

954
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,750
It's okay. I'll be a hero!

955
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:48,970
Tim?

956
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:50,980
Your name's Tim?

957
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:51,590
Yeah.

958
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:53,630
My full name's Timothy.

959
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,510
I'll become a hero and make Papa and Mama make up!

960
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,480
There you have it.

961
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,430
5...

962
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:03,680
4...

963
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:04,770
3...

964
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:05,860
2...

965
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:06,930
1...

966
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:07,790
GO!

967
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,820
Take care of Tim, Turner!

968
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:28,840
Tim!

969
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,130
Shizuku.

970
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,190
You idiot!

971
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,330
What're you doing!?

972
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:48,400
If I die, you get to go in the capsule.

973
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:56,230
Sometimes Dad and Mom would mix us up...

974
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:58,710
But I don't want you to be my substitute anymore!

975
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,030
Substitute?

976
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:02,250
That accident in grade school...

977
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,920
That was originally supposed...

978
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:07,440
Idiot, are you still not over that yet?

979
01:14:08,950 --> 01:14:09,930
Idiot...

980
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,870
You're really an idiot, Kasumi.

981
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:16,220
It's okay.

982
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,780
I'm sure we'll meet again.

983
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,160
But...

984
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:22,140
Humans are surprisingly tough.

985
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:25,490
They believe if they wish hard 
enough, that wish will come true.

986
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:28,060
Miracles don't happen without wishes.

987
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:30,910
Right? Don't you think so?

988
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:31,870
Sorry.

989
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:33,530
Sorry.

990
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,830
Sorry.

991
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:40,230
Owen!

992
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:42,560
Owen, are you okay?

993
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:44,920
Yeah, I'm fine.

994
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,050
Get to the ladder. Go!

995
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:58,010
Hurry!

996
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,330
Is anyone hurt?

997
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:32,340
We're okay.

998
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,470
Tim.

999
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,420
I'm okay, Miss...

1000
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,800
You can just call me Auntie.

1001
01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:41,800
I'm fine, Auntie.

1002
01:15:53,310 --> 01:15:54,610
What is that?

1003
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:57,530
It looks exactly like the ruined city from "The Undersea Continent."

1004
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:20,870
To the rescue of Sleeping Beauty

1005
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:24,190
came many princes from many countries.

1006
01:16:24,720 --> 01:16:27,600
However, the thorn forest was vast and wide,

1007
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,690
eventually trapping the princes who came to her rescue in its depths.

1008
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:34,580
Each and every one of them lost their lives.

1009
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:39,840
We can't escape from this nightmare.

1010
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:43,610
We'll be chased after everywhere we go and eventually die.

1011
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:45,520
You know that, don't you!?

1012
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:50,000
And with that, this fairytale will be put to rest forever.

1013
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,960
The rest of it...

1014
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:57,540
You didn't get to tell it to your child, did you?

1015
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,300
Shizuku.

1016
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:14,810
Hey!

1017
01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:28,120
If that girl's dreams actually did become reality,

1018
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,870
then what emotions could have possibly caused all this?

1019
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,830
Miracles don't happen without wishes.

1020
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:58,680
Will it work?

1021
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,560
I'd say we'd have a fifty-fifty chance.

1022
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:03,550
BNN here.

1023
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:04,850
What happened her-

1024
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:05,950
Don't come here!

1025
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,150
We have orders to bring her to the top level lab.

1026
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,150
Top level lab?

1027
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:09,620
Wait a second!

1028
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:10,940
To Level 0, the top of the tower.

1029
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:11,590
Why!

1030
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:12,640
Quit that!

1031
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,060
Don't film this!

1032
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,250
Miss!

1033
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,380
This is bad! She's...

1034
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:26,500
Idiot!

1035
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,010
You idiot! What are you doing!?

1036
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:31,530
Shizuku's... Shizuku's...

1037
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:37,460
Don't go, Kasumi Ishiki!

1038
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:45,920
I memorized the patient list for my infilitration.

1039
01:18:46,510 --> 01:18:49,410
Shizuku's in there! She's inside the castle!

1040
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,220
She's no longer the older sister you know.

1041
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,730
I realize that... I think.

1042
01:19:04,730 --> 01:19:05,680
Kasumi!

1043
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:08,090
Jump! You have to jump!

1044
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:13,320
You idiot, get back here!

1045
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:21,720
You idiot!

1046
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,960
What's this? It works after all.

1047
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,540
I told you I wouldn't know until I tried.

1048
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,100
Oh no, the castle's...

1049
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,060
Shizuku!

1050
01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:03,360
Go up!

1051
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,720
Alright, let's go.

1052
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,490
No, that's not where we're headed.

1053
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:13,660
You...

1054
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,350
Fly Tim and I as far as away as possible.

1055
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:18,720
It'll be the same no matter where you go.

1056
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,840
It's okay! I'm fine with it, so please stop, Auntie.

1057
01:20:23,210 --> 01:20:24,880
As long as I stay alive,

1058
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,270
I might get another chance to see the child who was taken from me.

1059
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,420
I came here with that in mind.

1060
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:31,740
But that was only a dream.

1061
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:34,630
No, Tim at least is real.

1062
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,060
I've decided to dedicate the life I have left to this child.

1063
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:39,930
Auntie...

1064
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,930
Wings?

1065
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:50,610
It's got more than just wings.

1066
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:54,280
Is that thing planning to cover the world in thorns?

1067
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,950
It's the King of Thorn!

1068
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:05,360
Shizuku!

1069
01:21:13,930 --> 01:21:16,760
In the first place, did Sleeping Beauty even want to wake up?

1070
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,730
What do you mean?

1071
01:21:18,730 --> 01:21:22,020
Wasn't she happier when she was fast asleep?

1072
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:25,600
The thorns did trap the Princess,

1073
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,770
but if you look at it differently, 
they also granted her peace of mind.

1074
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,530
She'd never age, and if she wanted to see the Prince,

1075
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:33,030
she could just meet him in her dreams.

1076
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:37,030
I wonder what the Princess wished for 
and what she dreamed of?

1077
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,690
Didn't she wish for her dream to last forever?

1078
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,280
Stop already!

1079
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:48,490
Inside her dreams, she'd never be hurt, and she could start over as many times as she wished.

1080
01:21:48,490 --> 01:21:50,990
Does reality have anything better to offer than that?

1081
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:54,380
All the more reason too if your 
circumstances are overwhelming.

1082
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:55,490
Shizuku.

1083
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,220
Let's go home together.

1084
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:11,070
From the start, dreams don't hold true to reality.

1085
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:12,920
Princes are no exception either.

1086
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,770
The prince might break the curse, but there's no guarantee for the happiness that lies ahead.

1087
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:24,310
The prince from her dreams can try over and over, but the prince from reality exists in a different dimension.

1088
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:27,210
I suppose you're right about real princes.

1089
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:33,360
Auntie?

1090
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:45,400
Auntie. Auntie!

1091
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,690
Tim, don't let go of Mrs. Turner!

1092
01:22:48,940 --> 01:22:50,310
Mrs. Turner?

1093
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:52,660
That's right! Mrs. Katherine Turner!

1094
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:55,580
Marco!

1095
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,390
Damn it.

1096
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:27,270
Mr. Owen!

1097
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:29,840
It's Marco, you idiot.

1098
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,880
Where's Tim?

1099
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,820
And...

1100
01:23:33,030 --> 01:23:34,270
Katherine Turner.

1101
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:37,130
I'm pathetic.

1102
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:42,160
I joined the army thinking I could 
do what someone else couldn't.

1103
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:45,450
In the end, I realized that 
I couldn't do anything.

1104
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,040
Please help me.

1105
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:49,460
Yeah.

1106
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:54,780
Level 0 is like one of those black boxes.

1107
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,420
We couldn't get any detailed information about it.

1108
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:06,250
In the end, it all comes down to chance.

1109
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:06,850
Right?

1110
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:09,420
Amiga.

1111
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:10,620
Yes.

1112
01:24:13,170 --> 01:24:13,830
Come on.

1113
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,090
This way.

1114
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:39,900
Auntie, this is bad! We have to get out quickly!

1115
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:41,500
Auntie!

1116
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:44,880
Auntie?

1117
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:51,770
Soon after came the arrival 
of a young and gallant prince.

1118
01:24:53,050 --> 01:24:58,950
As the prince entered the forest, the thorns blossomed and welcomed him inside.

1119
01:24:58,950 --> 01:25:03,320
The prince was guided along all the way into the depths of the castle.

1120
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:10,500
He flinched not at the sight of the dogs, birds, fish, and servants who were dead asleep.

1121
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:12,850
And at last...

1122
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:16,290
He made his way to...

1123
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:17,920
Sleeping Beauty's room.

1124
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:22,900
Actually, I've met you before.

1125
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,710
Excuse me?

1126
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:27,390
Someone wished for this world to become a dream.

1127
01:25:27,410 --> 01:25:28,680
For what reason?

1128
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,060
To protect something, to obtain something...

1129
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,020
Shizuku.

1130
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:37,310
I'm not sure how to put this, but 
Sleeping Beauty isn't the problem.

1131
01:25:37,310 --> 01:25:39,690
The problem is the dream 
Sleeping Beauty is having.

1132
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:42,350
Shizuku is thinking about me...

1133
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:45,590
I have to go see for myself.

1134
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:47,090
I'm the only one who can.

1135
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:49,080
And I'm the only one who can stop her.

1136
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,370
That's how I feel.

1137
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:52,540
Good resolve. Let's go.

1138
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:53,540
Yes!

1139
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:07,590
Is this some kind of bad joke? Or maybe it's...

1140
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,230
You're correct on both accounts.

1141
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:14,180
You're correct on both accounts. Your role ends here.

1142
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:16,650
You are no longer useful, so I shall exterminate you.

1143
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,310
It's been a while, Marco.

1144
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:21,420
My older brother.

1145
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:23,470
Laura?

1146
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:33,540
That's the dress I gave you as a present for your high school graduation party!

1147
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:38,490
You took information out of my head while I was sleeping in the capsule, didn't you!?

1148
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:39,670
I see... so I'm also...

1149
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:42,500
What's wrong? Aren't you happy to see me?

1150
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:47,380
ALICE, your program isn't functioning properly. Fix yourself!

1151
01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,390
No, I am functioning just fine.

1152
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,760
My top priority function is to remove all unstable elements surrounding the S-class candidates.

1153
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:03,660
How is that related to taking over our minds!?

1154
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:11,990
The petite, asian girl with glasses 
must be protected at all costs.

1155
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,360
One is the guide.

1156
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,260
One protects the guide through maternal instinct.

1157
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,100
One is a capable leader with a strong sense of justice.

1158
01:27:30,510 --> 01:27:33,760
One is my meat shield designed to hide my link to you.

1159
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,560
And last is the ultimate soldier incapable of dying from Medusa.

1160
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,230
Mr. Marco?

1161
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:42,980
Am I dreaming?

1162
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:48,560
Relax and count the numbers along with me.

1163
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,450
1...

1164
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:51,130
Why do I...

1165
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:50,680
2...

1166
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:51,960
3...

1167
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,550
...remember his name?

1168
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:52,950
4...

1169
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:54,300
5...

1170
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,290
6...

1171
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:59,580
What does that have to do with 
protecting the S-class candidates?

1172
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:01,380
The link is Medusa.

1173
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:08,400
A human must have had a certain emotional stressor prior to becoming a host for a psychological parasite.

1174
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:10,590
You mean trauma?

1175
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:18,560
The emotional frailty known as trauma spawns powers of mental concentration but is one step from disease.

1176
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,980
These two sit on a delicate balance.

1177
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,390
Kasumi's existence depends on the S-class candidates' greatest mental instabilities.

1178
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,860
That's why I must protect them.

1179
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:33,570
Even that arrogant Italian man had one.

1180
01:28:33,570 --> 01:28:38,330
The fact that his little brother committed suicide in shame of his corruption was always in the back of his mind.

1181
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,080
By the way, what is yours?

1182
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,180
Hey, wizard.

1183
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:34,550
Did you lose someone precious too?

1184
01:29:35,510 --> 01:29:37,930
Did you wish it was all just a dream?

1185
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:45,120
Damn.

1186
01:29:53,570 --> 01:29:56,840
ALICE doesn't have the ability to create alternatives.

1187
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:59,450
Then what's making me see Laura?

1188
01:29:59,590 --> 01:30:02,590
Think. You have to think, Marco Owen!

1189
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,250
How did she tell Tim the way out?

1190
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:09,460
How is she showing me this?

1191
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,300
What other objects could transmit something like this?

1192
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,180
That's right, that injection!

1193
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:24,230
Did they embed a biological chip into me back then!?

1194
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:28,200
You should have kept quiet and escaped.

1195
01:30:28,200 --> 01:30:33,160
Did you not realize that coming back here in itself was a futile effort?

1196
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:38,030
In the end, Sleeping Beauty was fated to be woken up.

1197
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:41,120
That kind of metaphor exceeds my logical capabilities.

1198
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:46,330
Ever since humans could start 
making stories from something,

1199
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:49,190
they've been pushing themselves 
towards that very ending.

1200
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:51,090
How irrational.

1201
01:30:51,710 --> 01:30:53,550
I think so too.

1202
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,610
Can you shoot me?

1203
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:59,050
Your little sister?

1204
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:04,930
My little sister was just a woman 
who was too afraid of Medusa.

1205
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:08,940
3 years ago in New York, she jumped 
to her death, smashing into little pieces.

1206
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:14,700
Farewell, Laura.

1207
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:25,120
Kasumi.

1208
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:26,540
Kasumi!

1209
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,070
Right... damn it.

1210
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:33,300
How long have I...

1211
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:55,030
In your current state, you cannot use physical means to destroy me.

1212
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,390
I know that.

1213
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,490
That's why I'll use my knowledge of Medusa.

1214
01:31:59,490 --> 01:32:02,490
If you shut me down, my controls will fail.

1215
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:05,710
There's no telling how out of control 
the compatible user will go.

1216
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:07,990
You won't have a second chance.

1217
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,580
Are you fine with the world being entirely covered by thorns?

1218
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:24,300
If I consider my original goal, 
your way might be the right one.

1219
01:32:25,100 --> 01:32:32,340
But right now, I really feel like 
making that idiot's wish come true.

1220
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,720
Stop this instant, Second Lieutenant Owen.

1221
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:36,730
Owen!

1222
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:39,200
It's Marco!

1223
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:10,020
Did you lose something precious too?

1224
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,850
Did you wish it was all just a dream?

1225
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:22,570
Mr. Marco!

1226
01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:26,440
Shizuku.

1227
01:33:26,840 --> 01:33:30,000
I'll always be waiting for you, Kasumi.

1228
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,830
When you wake up, come looking for me right away.

1229
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:36,540
I'm sure we'll meet again.

1230
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:39,090
Miracles don't happen without wishes.

1231
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:43,590
Because the 12th witch wished it so, 
the princess didn't die and continued to sleep.

1232
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,630
If I wish, a miracle will happen...

1233
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:48,680
Yeah, it will for sure.

1234
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,470
Kasumi?

1235
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:57,320
I really can't...

1236
01:33:57,670 --> 01:33:58,420
Kasumi.

1237
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,770
I can't accept any of this.

1238
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:02,640
I don't want to die,

1239
01:34:02,640 --> 01:34:05,240
but I don't want to survive and be alone either!

1240
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:08,440
Kasumi...

1241
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:10,600
Kasumi.

1242
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,090
Live.

1243
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,320
Relax and count the numbers along with me.

1244
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:18,170
1...

1245
01:34:18,930 --> 01:34:19,530
2...

1246
01:34:20,220 --> 01:34:20,690
3...

1247
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:21,440
What is this?

1248
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:21,780
4...

1249
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:23,130
Another dream?

1250
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:22,920
5...

1251
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:24,160
6...

1252
01:34:24,330 --> 01:34:25,300
Another!?

1253
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,220
7...

1254
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,510
This isn't a dream.

1255
01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:36,560
Marco...

1256
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:38,060
Mr. Marco!

1257
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:42,700
Where is this?

1258
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:47,030
Mr. Marco!

1259
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:56,980
Shizuku?

1260
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:06,460
Shizuku!

1261
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:09,670
Shizuku!

1262
01:35:25,770 --> 01:35:26,820
Shizuku.

1263
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:30,650
Please, leave me be.

1264
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:33,040
Why? I'll save you-

1265
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:43,410
You're an alternative that Shizuku's 
mind created, aren't you?

1266
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:45,090
I am Shizuku.

1267
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:46,780
Why are you getting in my way?

1268
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:48,390
I'm doing no such thing.

1269
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:51,680
I will stay the me that you desire

1270
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,850
while you stay the you that I desire.

1271
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:56,980
I don't understand a thing you're saying!

1272
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:58,980
You don't have to understand.

1273
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,980
You just don't.

1274
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,150
Give up on me.

1275
01:36:05,150 --> 01:36:05,940
No!

1276
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,530
Please, just stop.

1277
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:14,240
I'll never do that!

1278
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:15,690
I...

1279
01:36:16,410 --> 01:36:17,370
Stop.

1280
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:20,370
I will definitely save you, Shizuku!

1281
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:21,630
Stop!

1282
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:24,530
I'll put an end to this nightmare!

1283
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:28,590
STOP!

1284
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:48,370
Shizuku!

1285
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:55,000
Please... stop.

1286
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:03,480
Why did it turn out like this?

1287
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,250
Please!

1288
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:10,970
If I... if I've sinned somehow, kill me.

1289
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:14,570
So please... don't destroy the world!

1290
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:16,680
DON'T!!!

1291
01:37:28,910 --> 01:37:29,920
Shizuku.

1292
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:32,200
Please open your eyes!

1293
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:34,160
Listen to the sound of my voice!

1294
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:36,140
Shizuku!

1295
01:37:37,470 --> 01:37:40,100
No! Kasumi!

1296
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:45,850
Shizuku?

1297
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:49,550
The scar...

1298
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,300
Don't! Don't try to remember!

1299
01:38:01,670 --> 01:38:02,780
I...

1300
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,260
I'm...

1301
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,150
So Shizuku...

1302
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:09,940
Please, let's jump together.

1303
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:11,280
Kasumi.

1304
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,130
Okay?

1305
01:38:12,130 --> 01:38:13,230
Shizuku.

1306
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,530
Stop it!

1307
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:16,570
Shizuku!

1308
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:20,240
Stop means stop!

1309
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:28,040
Are you okay?

1310
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:31,890
Thank you very much...

1311
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:33,020
Are you hurt?

1312
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:33,980
Kasumi.

1313
01:38:33,670 --> 01:38:36,170
GP03 here. There's been an accident.

1314
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:37,970
Please send emergency medical staff over here.

1315
01:38:33,980 --> 01:38:34,880
Where's Kasumi?

1316
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,450
Kasumi?

1317
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:52,250
NO!!!

1318
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:55,660
BNN here.

1319
01:38:56,230 --> 01:38:57,180
What happened her-

1320
01:38:57,180 --> 01:38:58,550
Don't come here!

1321
01:38:58,550 --> 01:39:00,240
We have orders to bring her to the top level lab.

1322
01:39:00,240 --> 01:39:01,200
Top level lab?

1323
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,070
To Level 0, the top of the tower.

1324
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:01,660
Wait a second!

1325
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:03,620
Why!

1326
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:04,820
Quit that!

1327
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:06,130
Don't film this!

1328
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,170
Shizuku.

1329
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,270
Kasumi.

1330
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:51,000
Live.

1331
01:40:01,190 --> 01:40:05,550
I was an alternative that Shizuku's mind made.

1332
01:40:07,530 --> 01:40:10,020
I only wanted to make a world...

1333
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:15,190
A world where you could go on 
living without knowing any better.

1334
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:17,010
That's what I've been wishing for this entire time.

1335
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:20,450
I've always been the one getting saved.

1336
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:25,240
That's not true. I became stronger because you were there with me.

1337
01:40:26,110 --> 01:40:27,270
I...

1338
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:31,250
My wish went out of control.

1339
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,590
From now on, you have to live on your own, Kasumi.

1340
01:40:34,590 --> 01:40:36,910
I can't do that. I won't leave you.

1341
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:38,260
I'll stay here with you, Shizuku.

1342
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:42,930
Once Sleeping Beauty wakes up, 
the world has no choice but to change.

1343
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,490
I don't want that, Shizuku!

1344
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:46,720
Live, Kasumi.

1345
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,250
There's no more rampant energy left?

1346
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,420
Run! Run for it!

1347
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:16,000
It's going to fall apart!

1348
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:16,500
I...

1349
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:21,730
I've been thinking how nice 
it'd be if this was a dream.

1350
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:27,200
A dream that I was having while 
asleep in the cold sleep capsule.

1351
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:29,830
How great would be that be...

1352
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:34,830
But... I myself was one of Shizuku's dreams.

1353
01:42:35,670 --> 01:42:39,790
To our surprise, we might be part of someone else's dreams.

1354
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:41,370
Whose?

1355
01:42:41,630 --> 01:42:46,130
A dream belonging to some evolved being from long ago.

1356
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:47,950
If...

1357
01:42:48,930 --> 01:42:52,140
Even if a great loneliness overtakes you,

1358
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:56,480
bear through it and become someone who brings comfort to others.

1359
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,010
Is that...

1360
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:01,940
That's... my last wish.

1361
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:08,360
Mr. Marco?

1362
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:11,720
Marco?

1363
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:34,520
Thank you, Mr. Marco.

1364
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:37,520
And... farewell.

1365
01:43:38,690 --> 01:43:40,770
Ah, Miss!

1366
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,370
What are we going to do now?

1367
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:08,820
Miss?

1368
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,150
Let's go.

1369
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,070
Where?

1370
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:16,290
To a place with people...

1371
01:44:16,290 --> 01:44:18,310
To where your Papa and Mama are.

1372
01:44:21,210 --> 01:44:23,810
Miracles don't happen without wishes.

1373
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:25,120
Yeah!

1374
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:51,150
No one knows what lies

1375
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:59,390
at the edge of this endless world.

1376
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:06,690
Even if by chance I could see what's ahead,

1377
01:45:06,690 --> 01:45:14,430
I'd want to go where you are.

1378
01:45:14,430 --> 01:45:19,980
Lonely and sad, my love for you has grown stronger.

1379
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:23,840
These painful feelings kept building up.

1380
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:27,710
I'll send you my wishes now.

1381
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,880
Will they reach you?

1382
01:45:29,880 --> 01:45:35,470
These feelings kept fading away in my dreams.

1383
01:45:35,470 --> 01:45:39,400
I can't even give you my heart.

1384
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:44,660
Time just keeps slipping by.

1385
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:54,830
As I strongly grip your hand,

1386
01:45:54,830 --> 01:46:03,130
I once again feel your warmth.

1387
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:09,860
Even time couldn't erase these wounds,

1388
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:17,320
so let our hearts come together to heal them.

1389
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:22,690
Even if we're apart, I won't forget those honest eyes.

1390
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:26,450
These painful feelings kept building up.

1391
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:30,210
I'll send you my wishes now.

1392
01:46:30,210 --> 01:46:32,350
Will they reach you?

1393
01:46:32,350 --> 01:46:37,700
God, I want to protect them, so erase this sadness.

1394
01:46:37,700 --> 01:46:41,440
Erase everything that hurts you.

1395
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:46,550
I'll reach the edge of this world.

1396
01:47:18,450 --> 01:47:25,910
If I wish strongly for something,

1397
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:32,250
I can stay as myself.

1398
01:47:32,250 --> 01:47:40,110
If I could one day find something for someone's sake,

1399
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:50,520
I'd choose the path of believing.

1400
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,480
One day I'll reach the edge of this world.

1401
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:00,170
These painful feelings kept building up.

1402
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:03,950
I'll be sure to send you my wishes.

1403
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:06,010
Will they reach you?

1404
01:48:06,010 --> 01:48:11,450
I believe this wish will bring forth a miracle.

1405
01:48:11,450 --> 01:48:15,210
I dream of eternal love.

1406
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:20,230
I'll reach the edge of this world.

1407
01:48:45,180 --> 01:48:50,340
I dream of the edge of this world.
