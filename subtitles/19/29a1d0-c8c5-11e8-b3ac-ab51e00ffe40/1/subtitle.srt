in my corn again.</i>

3
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:58,725
<i>He had no fence that would hold it,
so I put it in my pen.</i>

4
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:02,604
I told him he could have his hog back
when he paid me a dollar pound fee.

- What did he say to that?
- "He didn't say nothin'."

"Bring a beau by."

170
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,811
My phone rang
just one time last week.

171
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,813
Just one time.

172
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:55,484
And this man with a deep,
beautiful voice says...

173
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,154
"Can I interest you in
the "Encyclopaedia Britannica?"

174
00:12:59,238 --> 00:13:02,491
Let's go upstairs, and I'll give you
a permanent. That'll cheer you up.

175
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,410
Clara, you've given me three permanents
in the last six months.

176
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,579
All my ends are splittin'.

177
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:12,376
<i>Oh, Clara, it's unnervin'
havin'all this time on my hands.</i>

178
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,880
I wanna rush home and fix supper
for some big, handsome man...

179
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:20,884
and put kids in a bathtub
and broil steak and crank ice cream...

180
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:24,388
and... think about
what the night's gonna bring.

181
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:28,183
Why aren't there enough men
to go around?

182
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:31,019
There's no shortage.
Just of the right kind.

183
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:35,023
- Ooh, I'm not fussy on that subject.
- Neither am I.

184
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:39,695
Tell me just one thing. Have you ever,
in your life, been proposed to?

185
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,281
- "I have."
- And you let him go?

186
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,826
No, I didn't let him go.
I watched him get scared off.

187
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:49,955
Hmm, he came to call on me,
and then he met my father.

188
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,708
Then he didn't come calling
on me anymore.

189
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:58,380
Speaking of your father, when's
that august personage coming home?

190
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,216
Tomorrow,
and the forecast...

191
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,552
<i>is storm and thunder.</i>

192
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:07,222
Well, you come on over
to my house for supper.

193
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,224
Alan's been askin'
about you.

194
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:12,227
He's sick in bed,
bein' fed milk puddin'...

195
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:14,646
all dreamy with temperature.

196
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,566
Thoroughly enjoying himself.

197
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:23,197
I'd give something to know what goes on
in my brother's temperature dreams.

198
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,074
I know what goes on
in mine.

199
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,998
Uh, don't swivel around.

200
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:36,502
There's someone comin'.
[Clears Throat] Someone young.

201
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:40,255
It's probably
a sewing machine salesman.

202
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:44,593
Yes, well, even if it is, don't say no
right off. Let's at least talk.

203
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:52,059
Morning, ladies.
Fine, warm day, isn't it?

204
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,937
Yes, indeed.
Pretty as a picture.

205
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,774
My, my. You all look like
two butterflies lit out on the grass.

206
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,776
Hello again, Miss Clara.

207
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:04,238
If it's work you're looking for,
you can see the foreman at the gin.

208
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,324
If it's food, they'll take care of you
'round the back door.

209
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,910
Well, now, you hadn't
hit on it yet, lady.

210
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,496
What I'd like to see now
is the man of the house.

211
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,959
Lucius?

212
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,841
<i>What is it, Miss Clara?</i>

213
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:28,136
Would you tell Mr. Jody there's a person
waiting to see him, please?

214
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,889
You could have said
"gentleman."

215
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:33,475
Same amount of wind.

216
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,608
Where did you find him?

217
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,486
Out on the road.
I gave him a lift this mornin'.

218
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:47,281
Why did you have to go
and be so unfriendly?

219
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,867
Agnes, the last, desperate
resort is strangers.

220
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,828
- We haven't come to that yet.
- Oh, haven't we just.

221
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,373
Clara, you want to hear
a cold, clinical fact?

222
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,959
Every single girl we went
to normal school with...

223
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:02,546
is married and pregnant
or about to be...

224
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,174
while I'm residing
with my mother and brother...

225
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:09,720
and you're still occupyin' the bedroom
you had when you was 13.

226
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,805
I don't know
about you, Clara.

227
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:14,641
I know what's
making me nervous.

228
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,394
Well, don't throw in
the towel yet, Agnes dear.

229
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,731
Those tranquilizers
may see us through yet.

230
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,234
- You Varner?
- Yeah, I'm one Varner.

231
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:28,280

- Hey, turn that thing off, Eula!

232
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,241
- "[Eula Laughing]"
- [Laughing] What can I do for you?

233
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:35,245
My name's Quick.
I heard you had a farm to rent.

235
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,627

come up there and kick that thing in!

<i>[Jody, Eula Laughing]</i>

237
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,131

00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,135
- How much family you got, boy?
- You're looking at it.

239
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,930
Well, a man usually puts six,
seven hands in the field.

00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:55,265
Well, one's all
you'll get from me.

<i>Jody, you've got the store
to talk business in.</i>

242
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,146
For heaven's sakes!
It's our passenger!

243
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,190
- How do you do, ma'am?
- Hello yourself.

244
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,609
- Here now. You two know each other?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:07,611
How come?

246
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,281
The how come is Clara and I obliged him
with a ride when his car broke down.

247
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,369
Well, we're talkin' business.
Come on now. Come on now!

250
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:25,796
- How much rent you aimin' to rent for?
- Oh, half your crop.

251
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,466
You furnish out
of my store.

252
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,468
No cash?

253
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,720
Mm-hmm.

254
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:37,724
That's food and tobacco at your prices.
That makes a dollar worth
about six bits.

255
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:39,810
Take it or leave it.

256
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,981

Lady, I never move

Mr. Quick, my daddy's
coming home tomorrow.

He sets quite a store by this rug.
You tracked it, you clean it.

267
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,094
That's a lot of fuss to be makin'
about a rug, lady.

268
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:58,514
If it's the rug
that's botherin' ya.

You're being personal with me.
I'll be personal with you.

I've spent my whole life around men
who push and shove and shout...

274
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,369
and think they can make anything
happen just by bein' aggressive.

275

another one around the place.

00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,405
<i>But we done all right.
You can look at the books if you'd like.</i>

331
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:47,284
Well, now...
I intend to.

332
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:51,371
I'm gonna crawl over them books
like an old fly over flypaper.

333
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,957
You better bring me
another, Lucius.

334
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,168
Yes, sir,
I'm my old self again.

335
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,421
Them doctors down atJefferson,
they gutted me...

336
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,424
and took away just about every organ
they thought I could spare.

337
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:04,676
They didn't pare my spirit
down none.

338
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,723
Thank you, Jody, for your
kindly inquiries as to my health.

339
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,936
Next!

340
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:16,772
All right, sister.

341
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:19,483
You're on.

342
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,027
What do you want
to know, Papa?

343
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,279
You still fixin'
to get yourself known...

344
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,658
as the best-lookin', richest old maid
in the county...

345
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:29,660
or you seen
any young people lately?

346
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,662
Any young people
seen you?

347
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,289
Been to any parties, picnics,
barbecues, church bazaars?

348
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,333
Have you mingled?
Have you mixed?

349
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,711
Or have you kept yourself up
in that room all this time
readin' them poetry books?

350
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:42,965
I hope this doesn't come as a shock
to your nervous system, Papa...

351
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,384
but when you're away,
I do what I please.

352
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,303
Well, I'm back!

353
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,347
Welcome home.

354
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,185
Lucius!

355
00:24:27,676 --> 00:24:32,097
When are you gonna give me
my due respect in front of my wife?

356
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:34,057
I've got a business too,
Jody.

357
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,352
I've got a little respect
for that.

358
00:24:37,436 --> 00:24:39,354
I know you wasn't...

359
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:42,482
You and me just don't
talk the same language.

360
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:46,820
That's what gives us
our aches and our pains.

361
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,823
<i>"Now me"..."all the time"
I was in the hospital...</i>

362
00:24:49,865 --> 00:24:53,452
I didn't just lay there.
I was busy.

363
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:57,998
Yes, I wheeled and dealed.
That's what I done, boy. What about you?

364
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,417
- May wasn't so good.
- Oh.

365
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:02,628
ButJune and July
made up for it.

366
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,630
That's to be expected.

367
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:07,549
- I moved all our heavy farm equipment.
- Oh, yeah?

368
00:25:07,591 --> 00:25:09,885
We're fresh out
of inventory.

369
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:12,387
- Including that old tractor?
- That's right.

370
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,973
- The one that don't go uphill?
- Includin' that.

371
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:16,975
Good.

372
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,728
<i>I rented off that tenant farm
nobody 'round here would have.</i>

373
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,482
And a fella come down here
from Boston, Massachusetts.

374
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:27,402
He bought a lot of land
and built this big fence around it...

375
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,404
and started a goat ranch.

376
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:32,115
Only he plumb ran out of goats...

377
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,117
and it went bust.

378
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,119
- "Yeah?"
- Yeah.

379
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:40,165
<i>So, Papa, now you got 2,000 acres more
of good grassland.</i>

380
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:45,087
Well, seems like you ain't been sittin'
on your spine altogether.

381
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:48,173
- How'd you rent that farm off?
- On shares.

382
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:51,760
- "Profitable?"
- I had a little trouble with the man.

383
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,763
What's the name
of this poor unfortunate?

384
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,932
A fellow name of Quick.

385
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:02,479
Quick? Ben Quick?

386
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:04,982
Yeah, yeah,
from out west.

387
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:07,985
You knucklehead fool!

388
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:10,946
You empty-headed yokel!

389
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,366
- What are you calling me names for?
- "Quick.!"

390
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,077
Don't you keep abreast
of anything except Eula?

391
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,206
Don't you know what Quick means
in this county? Hellfire!

392
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,584
Ashes and char!

393
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:27,004
Flame follows that man
around like a dog!

394
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,339
He's a barn burner.

395
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,926
- I never do anything right. Do I?
- Not to my immediate recollection!

396
00:26:32,968 --> 00:26:35,637
You want to hear something?
I sweat around you.

397
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:38,974
All those months you were away
in the hospital, I was dry.

398
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:40,976
Now I'm sweatin' again.

399
00:26:41,018 --> 00:26:43,729
I ain't got time
for your personal troubles.

400
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:47,858
You started something with
Mr. Ben Quick, and I got to finish it...

401
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:50,819
before this house of mine
goes up in smoke!

402
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:59,620
[Tires Screech]

403
00:27:06,335 --> 00:27:08,295
I'm Varner.

404
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,631
Yeah, I already met
one Varner.

405
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,674
I'm the other.

406
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:17,179
Just driving by. Thought I'd stop
and see if you got any plans.

407
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,890
That cabin ain't fit for hogs...

408
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:22,559
but I can get along with it.

409
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,020
<i>Well, we can
talk that over.</i>

410
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:29,066
Way I hear it, you're a boy that gets
into trouble with your landlords.

411
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:32,110
The kind of trouble that might need
the help of the fire department.

412
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:36,865
If you scared of me, mister, why don't
you just come right out and say so?

413
00:27:36,907 --> 00:27:38,867
Huh!

414
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,578
Son, why should I
be scared of you?

415
00:27:43,622 --> 00:27:47,334
'Cause I got a reputation
for being a dangerous man.

416
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,796
Hmm.

417
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:53,590
You're a young,
dangerous man.

418
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:57,970
I'm an old one.

419
00:27:58,053 --> 00:28:00,931
You don't know who I am.
I better introduce myself.

420
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,810
I'm the big landowner
and chief moneylender in these parts.

421
00:28:04,893 --> 00:28:08,438
I'm commissioner of elections
and veterinarian.

422
00:28:08,522 --> 00:28:10,899
<i>I own the store
and the cotton gin...</i>

423
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,235
<i>and the grist mill,
the blacksmith shop.</i>

424
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:16,488
<i>It's considered unlucky for a man
to do his tradin'or gin his cotton...</i>

425
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:20,576
or grind his meal or shoe his stock...
anywhere else.

426
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,661
Now, that's who I am.

427
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:24,872
You talk a lot.

428
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,291
Yes, I do, son.

429
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,459
But I'm done
talkin' to you...

430
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:32,504
except for passing you on
this piece of information.

431
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:36,175
I built me a new jail
in my courthouse this year...

432
00:28:36,258 --> 00:28:39,720
<i>and if during the course of your stay
here something, anything at all...</i>

433
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,763
<i>should happen to catch fire...</i>

434
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:45,350
I think you oughta know
that in my jail...

435
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:49,354
we never heard of the words
"habeas corpus."

436
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,440
You'd rot.

437
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:56,612
Well, a smart man,
he'd give me a job.

438
00:28:56,695 --> 00:29:00,449
- You're already working for me.
- None of this weed-scratching.

439
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:04,661
I'm talkin' about a job
that'll give me a white shirt...

440
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:07,456
and a black tie
and three squares.

441
00:29:07,498 --> 00:29:11,376
You've got a place in your store
and several other spots
where you could use me.

442
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,922
You'd be writing yourself a fire
insurance policy into the bargain.

443
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:16,965
I'll give it some thought.

444
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,676
Yes or no, mister.
Ain't no in-between.

445
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,472
- You're mighty bushy-tailed
for a beginner.
- "I'm in a hurry."

446
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,643
You're wasting your time.
The job at the top's already taken.

447
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:31,980
- But like you said, you're an old man.
- I am that.

448
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:34,066
You bear that in mind.

449
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,735
Be respectful.

450
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:40,489
Yes, sir, Mr. Varner.
Now, just who do I have to kill?

451
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:45,494
Well, we won't start
right off with murder.

452
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:49,748
Happens I just got handed me
30 Texas horses on a foreclosure.

453
00:29:49,832 --> 00:29:52,417
You get rid of them for me
at a reasonable profit...

454
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,461
and we're in business.

455
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,967
[Engine Starts, Revs]

456
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:12,271
Well, there's a cool breeze
from the river, Alan.

457
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:14,982
Everything nice comes
with you, Clara...

458
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:18,777
hot broth, cool breeze
from the river.

459
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:20,779
How's your school?

460
00:30:20,863 --> 00:30:23,824
You mean that free-for-all
I run in town?

461
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:27,452
Those 35 hellions who are making
their last stand against me?

462
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:31,081
- [Laughs]
- I wouldn't say it was
a summer on the Riviera.

463
00:30:31,165 --> 00:30:33,959
Well, it's unnatural to keep kids
in school in the summertime.

464
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:36,461
In the winter they gotta
help work on the crops.

465
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,006
Somewhere along the line,
they gotta learn to read and write.

466
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,008
Besides, who knows?

467
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,888
I don't have much hope, but maybe I have
a young painter or poet cooped up there.

468
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:50,809
Oh, Alan,
I love this place.

469
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:55,564
Grace, dignity,
beautiful things left undisturbed.

470
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,317
Just the way they were
a hundred years ago.

471
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,237
Most people say
I'm fighting the 20th century.

472
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,781
I suppose I oughta
sell this place...

473
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:07,701
put it to corn and cotton,
go get a job like everybody else...

474
00:31:07,743 --> 00:31:09,786
but I wouldn't be
any good at it.

475
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,623
- I'd hate it and make a mess of it.
- Then don't do it.

476
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:15,709
There are enough hustlers around here
as is. You stand for something.

477
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:20,380
- You hold on to it.
- Your father refers to me
as decayed gentry.

478
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:24,259
[Chuckling] That's because
he is pea green with envy.

479
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:28,597
You listen here. He would
give anything to have what you have.

480
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,683
Wouldn't he just love to have
your shine and polish?

481
00:31:31,767 --> 00:31:35,812
He can put up all those billboards
and neon signs and fillin' stations...

482
00:31:35,896 --> 00:31:38,774
but quality is one thing
he can't buy, and he knows it.

483
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,776
He has quality, Clara...

484
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,778
in you.

485
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:48,992
That's what I came through
this dusty summer day to hear.

486
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,411
I want you to be hale
and hearty again.

487
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:55,791
I want you to be your courtly, gallant
self again and come callin' on me.

488
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,502
- Very soon, ma'am.
- Well, you better.

489
00:31:58,585 --> 00:32:01,588
Girls get all fidgety and looked at
sideways and talked about...

490
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:04,591
- when they don't have
their gentlemen callers.
- [Chuckling]

491
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,469
Besides, I've missed you.

492
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:11,640
That boy's temperature
has been a-hoverin'...

00:41:28,197 --> 00:41:32,534
A night like this is good for him.
It stimulates his liver.

653
00:41:32,618 --> 00:41:35,704
<i>[Alan] Oh, they'll catch
those horses, Mr. Varner.</i>

654
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,248
They'll catch them and make
good work teams out of them.

655
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:42,419
You figure you know them redneck farmers
better than me, huh?

656
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:44,421
[Chuckles]

657
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:48,091
Suppose that's 'cause
the, uh, Stewart family's...

658
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:50,677
<i>been in these parts a little longer
than the Varners.</i>

659
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,721
About 200 years.

660
00:41:52,763 --> 00:41:54,890
That's a long time
to live in one place.

661
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:57,559
You don't believe
in living in one place, Mr. Quick?

662
00:41:57,643 --> 00:42:00,479
Well, my family moved.
Not that they wanted to.

663
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:03,148
They was encouraged
by the local citizens.

664
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:07,361
- You a hunted man or somethin'?
- Somethin', Miss Eula.

665
00:42:07,444 --> 00:42:10,823
I'd like to hear
a yes or no answer to that, boy.

666
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:13,075
<i>[Will]
Well, ifhe's hunted...</i>

667
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:15,077
<i>he ain't caught.</i>

668
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,747
Lucius, pass the drinks. Who's for
drinkin' some of my fine brandy, huh?

669
00:42:18,831 --> 00:42:21,375
Alan, you're partial
to my brandy.

670
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:24,753
Let's see. How many years
you been drinkin' it now, huh?

671
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:26,755
Five? Six?

672
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:29,758
- I've enjoyed your hospitality
a long time, Mr. Varner.
- [Chuckles]

673
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:33,387
I sometimes ask myself, do we get
the major part of your attention...

674
00:42:33,428 --> 00:42:36,807
or are you brightenin' up
other parlors around the county?

675
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,893
That's Alan's
personal business, Papa.

676
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:41,937
Don't get yourself fussed,
sister.

677
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,982
Alan knows a friendly inquiry
when he hears it, don't you, Alan?

678
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:47,693
- When I hear one.
- Sure, sure!

679
00:42:47,776 --> 00:42:50,904
A friendly inquiry
never bothered nobody.

680
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:54,032
As I understand it,
when you ain't here with us...

681
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:57,995
you keep pretty close to your house,
uh, with your mother.

682
00:42:58,078 --> 00:43:00,581
Papa, I can't stand this.

683
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:03,625
<i>I think you've forgotten, Mr. Varner,
that my mother is a widow.</i>

684
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,461
- She relies strongly on me.
- Widow?

685
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:09,590
Your old man ain't dead.
He just disappeared.

686
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,384
Just wandered off.

687
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,262
- The end result is the same.
She's alone.
- No, she ain't, Alan.

688
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,347
She's got you.

689
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:19,516
She sure has you.

690
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,477
- I do my best.
- Not around here, you don't!

691
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,521
<i>[Jody Laughing]</i>

692
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:29,318
<i>Jody, you seem to enjoy
my conversation tonight.</i>

693
00:43:29,401 --> 00:43:31,987
- Guess I'll direct a little bit at you.
- "I didn't say nothin'."

694
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,989
You see Ben Quick here?

695
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:37,576
<i>He's goin'to work tomorrow in the store
as a clerk right alongside of you.</i>

696
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,872
<i>He's going to receive the same
identical wages, the same benefits.</i>

697
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:46,502
That don't seem to strike you
as quite so funny.

698
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:50,255
It don't.

699
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:53,133
What I mean to say is, Jody,
with Ben around...

700
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,344
you can sleep late mornings.

701
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,930
That is, as late as you figure
you can afford to.

702
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,894
[Laughs]
Outside, everybody!

703
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,939
Take the evenin' air.

704
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:25,207
Alan, I apologize
for what we are.

705
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,334
Don't, Clara.
It isn't necessary.

706
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,920
I wouldn't blame you
if you left right now.

707
00:44:30,003 --> 00:44:32,422
Other young men have
with much less cause than this.

708
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,968
My people have stood off Indians,
Yankees, carpetbaggers.

709
00:44:36,051 --> 00:44:40,305
The least they could expect of me
is to stand up to a Varner.

710
00:44:40,389 --> 00:44:44,017
All right then.
Let's go have some more.

711
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,773
- "[Boy] Eula.! Eu-ooh-la.!"
- "[Boy Whistling]"

712
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:51,775
Oh, listen to that.

713
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:55,904
If those boys don't sound like
a bunch of tomcats yowling at the moon.

714
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:58,657
<i>[Boys Whistling]
Eula.! Eula.!</i>

715
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,785
Isn't it terrible the way they come
prowlin' around here every night?

716
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:04,705
It's like that in town too.
They follow me wherever I go.

717
00:45:04,746 --> 00:45:07,666
- Don't go anywhere then. You stay put.
- Oh, now.

718
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:10,169
- You stay right close to home.
- Jody, they're harmless.

719
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,380
- They're only 16, 17 years old.
- You call that harmless?

720
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:17,301
- "Eula.!"
- "Hey, Eula.!"

721
00:45:17,384 --> 00:45:20,846
You quit it out there,
or I'll pass among you with a shotgun!

722
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:23,432
- [Chuckling]
- "Hey, Eula, come out.!"

723
00:45:23,515 --> 00:45:26,226
- "Eula.! Come on out.!"
- "Come on out, Eula.!"

724
00:45:26,268 --> 00:45:29,104
- Come on, Eula. Get out of the light!
- Oh!

725
00:45:29,146 --> 00:45:32,941
They don't have to see her.
They can smell her.

726
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,277
- "Eula.!"
- "Eula.!"

727
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,197
Tom Shortly, V.K. Bookwright,
John Fischer!

728
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,616
Now, I know it's you out there!
Now, quit it!

729
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,827
- "[Boys] Eula.!"
- Would somebody please make them stop?

730
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:47,039
- Just wait. I'll stop 'em.
- "Eula.! Eula.!"

731
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,041
It's a madhouse
around here.

732
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:54,171
They're just young boys.
Healthy, young animals.

733
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:57,716
How come they don't come
to anybody else's house,
hide in anybody else's garden?

734
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:01,678
- It's just us that gets singled out.
- We're the ones that got Eula.

735
00:46:01,762 --> 00:46:04,014
It's not her fault.
It's yours.

736
00:46:04,097 --> 00:46:07,559
They come here 'cause they know
you're gonna laugh,
you're gonna think it's funny...

737
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,978
no matter how crude
and how vulgar!

738
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,106
I was young myself once.

739
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:17,861
I used to hide in the greenery
and hoot and bellow.

740
00:46:17,945 --> 00:46:22,032
I'll bet you did. I'll bet you
stayed longest and yelled loudest.

741
00:46:22,115 --> 00:46:25,536
Your mama listened.

742
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:40,759
Blackjack!

743
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:43,887
[Chuckling]

744
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:46,348
All right.

745
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:49,351
Now let's deal 'em
off the top.

746
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,562
Huh.

747
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:57,192
Is that the way
you acquired your fortune?
The way you're acquiring mine?

748
00:47:07,035 --> 00:47:11,206
Those boys sure do make
their desires plain, don't they?

749
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:15,878
Callin' and callin',
just like they thought Eula
was gonna get up and follow 'em.

750
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:18,380
Wonder what would happen
if she did.

751
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:20,883
I imagine there'd
be quite a romp.

752
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:24,845
Now, why did I make
such a fuss about it?

753
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:27,681
Because
it offended you?

754
00:47:27,723 --> 00:47:29,850
No, it didn't.

755
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:32,895
Now that's the plain,
unvarnished truth at last.

756
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:37,065
No, Alan, there's no sense in pretendin'
that girls don't think about sex.

757
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:39,109
They do.

758
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:42,070
You oughta hear some of the
conversations between Agnes and me.

759
00:47:42,112 --> 00:47:44,072
Uh, I'd like to.

760
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:48,577
Well, there's nothing wrong
with being anxious about your love life.

761
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,662
I am about mine.

762
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:56,418
[Chuckles]

763
00:47:56,502 --> 00:48:00,923
This is certainly not the way I expected
this conversation to be going.

764
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:04,885
I thought we were gonna sit here
on the front porch
and let the moon shine down on us...

765
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:08,430
and, just like those boys in the bushes,
let nature take its course.

766
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:11,683
Why, Clara, nature
is taking its course.

767
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:16,313
You're not the kind of girl
to be howled at and dragged
off the porch into the bushes.

768
00:48:16,396 --> 00:48:19,274
You're a nice, quiet,
self-contained girl.

769
00:48:19,316 --> 00:48:23,278
You'll see. Everything you want's
gonna happen to you.

770
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:32,204
Oh, evening, Alice.

771
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,790
You want to see me?

772
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:37,584
Miss Minnie Littlejohn
say, "Where are you?"

773
00:48:37,668 --> 00:48:39,628
Oh.

774
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,964
- Where I am, huh?
- Yes, sir.

775
00:48:42,047 --> 00:48:46,093
She say if you're not there
in half an hour, the place'll
be triple locked against you.

776
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,929
Triple locked, huh?

777
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:52,307
You tell Miss Minnie Littlejohn
I'll be there...

778
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:54,309
when I'm there.

779
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,395
I'll tell her.

780
00:48:57,646 --> 00:49:00,983
It appears
I have a late date.

781
00:49:02,276 --> 00:49:05,195
Are you married?
You got a woman somewhere?

782
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,906
I live single.

783
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,950
Hmm.

784
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:11,994
You've known a few
though, huh?

785
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,455
Yeah. My fair share.

786
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:17,541
- [Chuckles]
- Deal.

787
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,504
Well, your friend left early,
without even firing a shot.

788
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:05,923
I was kissed good night,
Mr. Quick.

789
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,926
Kissed and left. That'd been me,
I'd have stayed till sunup.

790
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,928
- Aren't you reckless.
- Aren't you?

791
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:13,931
No, I'm just skittish, Mr. Quick.
Just plain skittish.

792
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,933
I have an answer for that.

793
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,645
Let's go get in that old Lincoln car
of yours and go plow up the countryside.

794
00:50:19,728 --> 00:50:22,105
Let's go holler off a bridge
good and loud.

795
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:26,318
- There's been enough commotion tonight.
- You want quiet?

796
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,779
Let's go find us
a needle in a haystack.

797
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:31,281
Mr. Quick, those are all
lovely, colorful suggestions...

798
00:50:31,365 --> 00:50:33,867
but I'm afraid if I
started out to follow you...

799
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:36,662
I would hear the starch
in my petticoat begin to rustle...

800
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:38,664
and I'd know
I was out of character.

801
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:41,083
Get out of character, lady.
Come on. Get way out.

802
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:43,168
Sudden changes
are not in my line.

803
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:45,170
You'll never know
till you try.

804
00:50:45,254 --> 00:50:48,799
There's a volume ofJane Austen
upstairs by my bed...

805
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,260
and a glass of hot milk
that's getting cold.

806
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:54,263
You mean your friend would not like it
if we went off together.

807
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:56,974
The idea of you and me
just wouldn't go down, would it?

808
00:50:57,057 --> 00:51:00,018
- I don't wish to discuss him with you.
- Why not? I respect him.

809
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:03,438
I admire his manners
and I admire the speeches he makes.

810
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,150
And I admire
the big house he lives in.

811
00:51:06,233 --> 00:51:08,902
But if you're savin' it

976
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,684
Or hand lotion?
Lilac water? Freckle remover?

977
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:09,188
Spotted dimity?

978
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:13,484
Just can't sell you,
can I?

979
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:17,488
Well, do you have an aspirin?
I have a headache.

980
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:19,865
Oh, sure.

981
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:23,452
We got all kinds
of nostrums and remedies.

982
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:26,663
'Course, I don't
have headaches myself.

983
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:30,834
- 'Cause I don't have any problems.
- Or scruples.

984
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:34,296
Nope, not those either.

985
01:02:34,379 --> 01:02:37,090
Well, I have both.

986
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,347
You got a thin skin
is what you got.

987
01:02:44,806 --> 01:02:47,226
But the world belongs
to the meat eaters, Miss Clara...

988
01:02:47,309 --> 01:02:50,437
and if you have to take it raw,
take it raw.

989
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:54,441
I couldn't live
that way.

990
01:02:55,818 --> 01:02:59,029
Well, let's just examine
the way you do live, Miss Clara.

991
01:02:59,112 --> 01:03:03,075
You drive around in that old Lincoln
car of yours like it had wings...

992
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,119
and you teach school,
and, uh...

993
01:03:06,203 --> 01:03:10,666
you sit on your front porch with your
skinny little friend drinkin' lemonade.

994
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,335
Now, what is all that,
when you see the rest of the world...

995
01:03:13,418 --> 01:03:15,420
passing you by
paired up?

996
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:19,007
You're, what, 23?

997
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:21,802
Yeah, thems are
golden years...

998
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:24,388
and you're bein' asked
to play a waitin' game.

999
01:03:25,514 --> 01:03:27,474
Why wait?

1000
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:33,480
Aw, school is out,
Miss Clara.

1001
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:37,609
Them blinds are drawn,
night's fallen.

1002
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,113
Nobody here to see
if you make a mistake.

1003
01:03:44,074 --> 01:03:47,161
You put them things down,
Miss Clara, 'cause I'm gonna kiss you.

1004
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:51,373
I'm gonna show you
how simple it is.

1005
01:03:51,415 --> 01:03:53,500
You please me,
and I'll please you.

1006
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:59,756
Oh, I know
what's troublin' you.

1007
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,552
It's all those boys
hollerin' for Eula every night.

1008
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:06,763
And Eula with her hair
hangin' down...

1009
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:10,350
and Jody with his shirt off,
chasin' her.

1010
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:12,853
And your old man
at 60...

1011
01:04:12,895 --> 01:04:15,147
and he's callin' on
his lady love.

1012
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:44,551
All right. You proved it.
I'm human.

1013
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:47,095
Yes, ma'am,
you're human all right.

1014
01:04:51,517 --> 01:04:53,435
Barn burner!

1015
01:04:58,774 --> 01:05:01,860
Well, you hit on it.

1016
01:05:01,944 --> 01:05:05,405
I can see my white shirt
and black tie and Sunday manners...

1017
01:05:05,447 --> 01:05:07,866
didn't fool you
for a minute.

1018
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:11,495
Well, that's right, ma'am.
I'm a menace to the countryside.

1019
01:05:11,578 --> 01:05:16,500
All a man's gotta do is just look at me
sideways, and his house goes up in fire.

1020
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:20,587
And here I am, livin' right here in the
middle of your peaceable little town.

1021
01:05:20,629 --> 01:05:23,257
Right in your backyard,
you might say.

1022
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,468
<i>Guess that oughta
keep you awake at night.</i>

1023
01:05:40,482 --> 01:05:45,112
- "[Crashing]"
- Anything you break,
you gotta pay for. Heh.

1024
01:05:45,154 --> 01:05:47,531
- What are you doin' here?
- Takin' the air.

1025
01:05:47,614 --> 01:05:51,368
You hired me to tend your store.
Now, I'm tendin' it.
That don't need no supervision.

1026
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,912
You and my daughter
had some words, huh?

1027
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:56,915
- Yeah, a few.
- She don't cotton to you much,
does she?

1028
01:05:56,999 --> 01:06:02,588
- Ain't no love lost.
- That don't need to slow you down none.

1029
01:06:02,671 --> 01:06:05,132
I put you forth
as a candidate.

1030
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:09,136
Oh, yeah? And just what office
you got me runnin' for?

1031
01:06:09,178 --> 01:06:13,307
I opened a lot of doors for you,
Ben Quick. Ever ask yourself why?

1032
01:06:13,348 --> 01:06:16,477
<i>Am I
a senile old man?</i>

1033
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,021
Am I a sentimental old fool?

1034
01:06:20,355 --> 01:06:23,400
- I am not.
- So?

1035
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:25,986
<i>I'm a man
with a purpose.</i>

1036
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:28,655
Well, we all got
some mission in life.

1037
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,492
Care to hear yours?

1038
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:35,537
Just what do you think
you'd like me to do...

1039
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,539
if you was able
to make me do it?

1040
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,708
Get married.

1041
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,378
Have sons.

1042
01:06:45,297 --> 01:06:48,425
- Well, I'll be damned.
- More than probable you will be...

1043
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:51,512
but first you're goin' to church
and get married, ya hear?

1044
01:06:52,763 --> 01:06:55,140
To my daughter.

1045
01:07:06,652 --> 01:07:09,071
That's the one you
didn't figure, ain't it?

1046
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:12,991
Yeah, that's the one.

1047
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,035
Well?

1048
01:07:16,745 --> 01:07:18,747
What about it?

1049
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:21,917
Well, I'd say it's
a mighty interestin' notion.

1050
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,253
"Notion"? Notion?

1051
01:07:24,336 --> 01:07:27,714
I'm talkin' about the survival
of my family name.

1052
01:07:27,756 --> 01:07:31,009
I'm talkin' about the establishment
of my immortality.

1053
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,555
You, you wanna
put down roots?

1054
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:38,600
Move to my house. Live with us.
Sleep under clean sheets.

1055
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,894
Study that skinny gal.

1056
01:07:44,314 --> 01:07:46,275
Well, now,
what's in it for me?

1057
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:50,028
Well, there's lands
and moneys...

1058
01:07:50,112 --> 01:07:52,156
on the day
of the weddin'.

1059
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:56,285
- More to come.
- What lands...

1060
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,954
what moneys,
and how much more?

1061
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:02,958
We'll have a meetin' with my banker
and my lawyer. You'll see for yourself.

1062
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,086
I'll take that old Frenchman's ruin
for a starter.

1063
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:10,841
- Well.
- Yeah. Right now. Tonight.

1064
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:14,845
- I'll give it to you in writin'.
- Yeah, you do that.

1065
01:08:14,928 --> 01:08:18,348
[Guffaws]
Who says I picked the wrong man?

1066
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:20,976
You and me
got a deal, Ben Quick.

1067
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:23,896
And who says marriages
are made in heaven?

1068
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,190
All of hell wouldn't
have this one!

1069
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,192
Now, make no mistake
about that gal.

1070
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:32,696
She's, uh, delicate, but in other ways
she's smart, like her mother before her.

1071
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:36,033
She has quality. Quality.

1072
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:40,120
It's as close as you and me
will ever get to it.

1073
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,960
<i>[Animal Bleating]</i>

1074
01:08:52,966 --> 01:08:54,968
<i>[Bleating]</i>

1075
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:58,680
- Move right in, boy. It's all yours.
- [Bleating]

1076
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:00,808
I'm movin' up
in the world.

1077
01:09:15,864 --> 01:09:17,991
Miss Clara's room is in
the back of the house.

1078
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:22,329
Mr. Jody
and Miss Eula.

1079
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:25,499
- And here's your room.
- And the old man?

1080
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,210
Never know where he is.
Don't sleep so good no more.

1081
01:09:28,293 --> 01:09:31,630
Just roves around from room to room,
sometimes three in a night.

1082
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:45,060
[Sighs]

1083
01:09:45,102 --> 01:09:49,314
I had five sisters
and a brother...

1084
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,692
and a mother and a father
and an old maid aunt.

1085
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:56,029
And all together,
we slept in a room about...

1086
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:58,073
half this size.

1087
01:09:58,115 --> 01:10:00,367
Same as my family.

1088
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:02,369
And look at us now,
Lucius.

1089
01:10:02,411 --> 01:10:05,789
Big rooms, small rooms...
all the same size to the Lord.

1090
01:10:05,873 --> 01:10:07,875
Bathroom's
end of the hall.

1091
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:39,823
Well, just so we don't
crowd each other...

1092
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:42,034
I shave nights
and shower mornings.

1093
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:21,532
You bringin' him here?
Into the house?

1094
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:23,951
Big house.
Room for one more.

1095
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:27,120
But he don't belong here.
He's hired help.

1096
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:32,292
- He's more than that.
- How much more than that?

1097
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:35,379
Well, he's gonna be
kind of brotherly, Jody.

1098
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:38,298
[Chuckles]
I brought you home a big brother.

1099
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,551
So look out for him.
Boy's clever.

1100
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:43,512
He'll be up when you're sleepin',
and he's gonna be where you ain't.

1101
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:48,684
Look alive, Jody. You're a couple
of racehorses startin' out even.

1102
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,979
Well, we'll see who is the fastest
and who is the smartest.

1103
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,941
It's not exactly even,
considerin' I'm your blood son!

1104
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,111
- Don't open that can of beans.
- Well, I am openin' it!

1105
01:12:01,196 --> 01:12:04,074
Well, then eat
what you got.

1106
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,118
Exactly nothin'.

1107
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:17,713
Am I your son...

1108
01:12:17,796 --> 01:12:19,840
or ain't I your son?

1109
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:24,052
You was born to me.

1110
01:12:24,094 --> 01:12:27,347
Ain't you got any affection for me...
or regard for me?

1111
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,976
- Just tell me that.
- You're just tryin' to
make yourself miserable.

1112
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:34,563
"Miserable"? Seems like I walked
around in misery all my life.

1113
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:37,399
You ain't never
been a papa.

1114
01:12:37,483 --> 01:12:40,861
No! 'Cept to tell me
to stand up straight.

1115
01:12:40,903 --> 01:12:43,739
You push, reach,
stretch yourself.

1116
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:46,200
I put down
a big footprint.

1117
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:51,914
I said, "Here.
Step in. Fill it."

1118
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,958
- You never did.
- Well, I tried.

1119
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,378
I tried to be what you wanted,
but I ain't got it in me.

1120
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,215
Where do ya go lookin' for it
if you ain't got it in you?

1121
01:13:01,298 --> 01:13:03,800
You find a way,
or you don't.

1122
01:13:06,261 --> 01:13:08,597
Papa, please.

1123
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:15,312
You have Lucius dig you up
some worms, Jody.

1124
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:20,984
You go fishin', boy.

1125
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,863
Jody?

1126
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:11,827
Don't you lie there with your face
in the pillow, Jody Varner.

1127
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,121
That's exactly what
he expects you to be doing.

1128
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:20,294
Jody.
You had spunk once.

1129
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:23,172
Remember, you used to throw
brown paper bags full of water...

1130
01:14:23,255 --> 01:14:25,507
on his head
from this very window.

1131
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:28,218
Remember? I'd fill 'em up,
and you'd throw 'em?

1132
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,762
You were only seven years old then,
and you were wonderful.

1133
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,848
You weren't
afraid then.

1134
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:35,934
Jody?

1135
01:14:36,018 --> 01:14:38,520
Jody, you remember
John Wesley Pritchard?

1136
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:40,689

in the school yard...

who just happened by."

1298
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:47,129
Well, let 'em talk.
I'll tell you one thing.

1299
01:24:47,212 --> 01:24:49,465
You gonna wake up
in the mornin' smilin'.

1300
01:24:49,548 --> 01:24:52,009
<i>That's not enough.
Do you understand me?</i>

1301
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:55,345
That is not nearly enough.

1302
01:24:55,429 --> 01:24:59,641
Mr. Quick, I am a human being.
Do you know what that means?

1303
01:24:59,725 --> 01:25:03,645
It means I set a price on myself,
a high, high price.

1304
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:06,648
You may be surprised
to know it...

1305
01:25:06,732 --> 01:25:08,734
but I've got
quite a lot to give.

1306
01:25:08,817 --> 01:25:11,945
I've got things I have been
savin' up my whole life...

1307
01:25:11,987 --> 01:25:14,698
things like love
and understanding and...

1308
01:25:14,781 --> 01:25:18,535
and jokes and good times
and good cooking.

1309
01:25:18,619 --> 01:25:21,580
I'm prepared to be the queen
of Sheba for some lucky man...

1310
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:25,584
or at the very least, the best wife
that any man could hope for.

1311
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,711
Now, that's my human history...

1312
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:29,713
and it's not gonna be
bought and sold...

1313
01:25:29,796 --> 01:25:33,300
and it's certainly not gonna be
given away to any passin' stranger.

1314
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:37,179
All right. Then run, lady.
And you keep on runnin'!

1315
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:39,223
Buy yourself a bus ticket
and disappear.

1316
01:25:39,306 --> 01:25:41,558
Change your name,
dye your hair, get lost!

1317
01:25:41,642 --> 01:25:45,562
And then maybe... just maybe...
you're gonna be safe from me.

1318
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:47,898
Clara?

1319
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:51,777
You, uh,
finished here, Clara?

1320
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,363
- Yes. Thank you, Alan.
- Well, now, I'll walk you back.

1321
01:25:55,447 --> 01:25:57,658
With your permission,
Mr. Quick.

1322
01:26:13,715 --> 01:26:15,843
- Do I look very flustered?
- Nope.

1323
01:26:17,010 --> 01:26:19,972
Well, I am.
Alan, let's stop a minute.

1324
01:26:23,851 --> 01:26:25,894
Well, uh,
what's wrong, Clara?

1325
01:26:27,062 --> 01:26:29,148
Wanna tell me?

1326
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:34,903
Alan, this is the hardest thing
I ever had to do in my life.

1327
01:26:34,987 --> 01:26:38,198
Well, tell me about it, and we'll
see if we can make it easier.

1328
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:45,706
Alan, I have told people you love me,
and I have told myself you love me.

1329
01:26:45,747 --> 01:26:48,750
Now, I've done this
for five years...

1330
01:26:48,834 --> 01:26:51,295
but I have never
heard you say it.

1331
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:54,923
And now I've gotta know.

1332
01:26:55,007 --> 01:26:59,595
Well, I guess I'd better say it then,
Clara. I do love you.

1333
01:26:59,678 --> 01:27:03,724
But do you want me
the way a man wants a woman?

1334
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:06,727
What I want
is to help you, Clara.

1335
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:11,231
But, Alan, that's such
a pitiful answer.

1336
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:16,069
That's such a good,
kind, pitiful answer.

1337
01:27:16,153 --> 01:27:19,156
It's the only kind of answer
I can make you, Clara.

1338
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:23,452
I didn't mean to waste
your young years like this...

1339
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:27,706
but... you're so sweet,
so graceful, so intelligent...

1340
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:29,750
and you never made
any demands.

1341
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:31,877
Well, I wanted to.

1342
01:27:33,795 --> 01:27:37,049
Oh, I came very close
a couple of times.

1343
01:27:37,132 --> 01:27:41,929
There were all sorts of feminine wiles
I was gonna try out on you.

1344
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:45,098
'Course, I don't guess
it would've done me any good.

1345

Your mama has
a long head start on me...

1346
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:50,354

gonna overtake her.

that must have been for you.

1356

1357

1359
01:28:41,363 --> 01:28:43,782
I lost me my store,
my wife's respect...

1360
01:28:43,866 --> 01:28:48,620
and my old man,
he hates me, worse than ever.

1361
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:51,623
All that's over now, boy. They're gonna
find you downstream tomorrow.

1362
01:28:51,707 --> 01:28:55,043

back in the world. Do you hear me?

to kill me?

you think I've taken.

1368

Now, look at that, Jody.

1370
01:29:22,446 --> 01:29:25,032
Yeah? So you got
five dollars.

1371
01:29:25,115 --> 01:29:28,869
- Who cares, boy?
- No, sir. Not no ordinary five dollars.

1372

It ain't spendin' money.

Jody,
this is treasure.

1374
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:38,837
- From where?
- From right outta my front lawn.

- No, sir.

I felt the same way too.

That is till
idle curiosity...

1385
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:10,911
led me to do a little pokin' around,

There's been a long,
hard silence between us.

1461

chokin' me.

Parents and children.

1467
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:53,540

Why do we have 'em?"

about women, Papa?

1475

were just...

ever get together.

1479
01:38:38,335 --> 01:38:41,004

all the time...

1480
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:44,883
look at her,
listen to her...

1481
01:38:46,468 --> 01:38:48,470

the whole world for me.

somethin' remarkable.

She did, Clara.

1485

to believe about me?

1486

1487

Clara to you without a stitch, huh?

1502

I'm gonna see to it that you got
the means to take care of Clara.

My name is Quick,
no matter how much people hate it.

I was one of'em.
I hated it too.

No, you didn't.

1624
01:50:41,391 --> 01:50:43,393
You hated me.

1625
01:50:46,814 --> 01:50:48,982
I guess I did.

1626
01:50:51,735 --> 01:50:55,322
You're a hardheaded,
softhearted woman, Miss Clara...

1627
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:57,366
and I like you a lot.

1628
01:50:57,407 --> 01:51:01,829
- You do, do you?
- Yes, I do. All of a sudden, I do.

1629
01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:09,878
And if you can save my life, I guess I
can return the favor. I can let you go.

Ain't nothin' to it.

All I gotta do is pack that old
straw suitcase of mine and...

say good-bye

Old jackass
name of Will Varner.

1647

That's who started it.
I dropped my cigar in the hay.

- That's right, Papa.

I'll be sayin' good-bye.

- Yeah, I'm leavin', soon as I
get my things together.

Don't the room and

- We sort of left off horses.

We got started on people.
Now, that's somethin' different.

and neither did I.

to the idea.

In fact, I've been a little long
comin' around to it, but...

Well, life's
a pretty valuable thing...

1677
01:53:45,701 --> 01:53:48,412
and it ought to be treated
with a certain amount of respect.

1678
01:53:48,495 --> 01:53:51,832
You're old enough to know that,
and I'm young enough to learn it.

1679

Well, isn't that the truth.

1680
01:53:55,919 --> 01:53:57,880
So I'll be
seein' you around, Will.

First off, nobody give you permission to
call me by my front name!

Will, that shoutin'
ain't becomin' to you.

1683

And second,
don't tell me what life is like!

is what I say it is!

your way, Will.

I got influence. I'll dog you
wherever you go. I'll break you.

No, you won't.
You'll miss me.

Huh? Now there's
your gratitude.

that boy where there was fast,
easy money just layin' there.

I put him in the Garden of Eden,
let him dip his bread in honey...

and you disappear.

just maybe...
