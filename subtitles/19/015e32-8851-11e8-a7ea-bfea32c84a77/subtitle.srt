1
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,000
And now it's my turn

2
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:54,500
I'm leaving this world

3
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,750
I'm leaving my memories

4
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:06,542
I see...

5
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,750
I see the kid

6
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:17,333
kid that I was

7
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:22,208
I see...

8
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,583
What are you doing out here?

9
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:47,083
Oh, I've been hired to escort
this one out to his uncle's

10
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:48,750
Parents can't handle
him no more

11
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:52,667
You ask me, he was left too long
to suckle on a negro pap

12
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,667
His uncle's got a ranch
in a town called Palomito

13
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,833
Maybe he can put some
starch in the boy

14
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,208
I'm the uncle
Give me the money, sir

15
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,542
The money...
Here's your damned money!

16
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:03,125
- It's all yours
- It's not damned money

17
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,708
- It's money blessed by God
- Go to hell!

18
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,458
-
-

19
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,375
What took you so long?

20
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,458
Well I'm in charge at the ranch and
my uncle...

21
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:20,958
What's your name?

22
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,542
Where are you from?

23
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,208
La Louisiane

24
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,708
Oh... Louisiana!

25
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,417
This is your first time

26
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,417
Yes, it is!

27
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,583
Yes, it is

28
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:53,083
No

29
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,583
Do you believe in God?

30
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,583
I don't know
Do you?

31
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,583
Today I do

32
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,958
My Mama gave it to me

33
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,917
Madeleine

34
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,708
Come here
Come here

35
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:21,208
We can go just the two of us
You and Me...

36
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,708
Sorry to break up the party

37
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:44,375
Leave me alone, Wally
I ain't working tonight

38
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,542
Doing virgins now, are we?

39
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,542
Don't be that way

40
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,042
I've been riding
all day long darling

41
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,750
just to get here and see you

42
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,625
Wally, please

43
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,833
Go. Go away!

44
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,375
You wanna see
how a man does it?

45
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,500
Go Go, Mike
He'll kill you!

46
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:24,000
You don't wanna die over
no whore, Mikee?

47
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,667
- Now get the hell out of here
- I stay

48
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,083
- Please, no, stop it!
- It's time to go!

49
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,125
Do you believe in God?

50
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,833
Madeleine
would you come with me?

51
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,917
I have money

52
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,083
Runi

53
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,333
Hey, Rolling Star!

54
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,917
You'd better feed him somehow

55
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:03,917
- Got time for a drink?
- Yeah, you know me

56
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,500
- Billy!
- Don't worry Billy

57
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,875
I'll take him

58
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:13,000
Do you mind building me one?

59
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:17,583
Here. How do you think your
little chat with Sullivan will go?

60
00:24:17,667 --> 00:24:19,292
Well, we'll see

61
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,792
You know, the town's starting to
hum

62
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:25,375
They say there's more gold in them
mountains than in all California

63
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,583
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of

64
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:38,333
Damn Jimmy!

65
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:40,625
- Goddamn butcher!
- Help!

66
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,042
Damn Jimmy, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

67
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:44,542
You're my deputy now

68
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,333
This dentist prick tried
to kill me!

69
00:24:46,417 --> 00:24:50,500
Put him down!
Put him down, I said

70
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:51,917
Please

71
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,833
Do it

72
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:56,125
What do you think you're doing?

73
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,125
You can't go throwing people
through windows!

74
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,708
We're the damn law

75
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,417
I quit, 'cause he deserves it!

76
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,417
You'd better rein in
that temper of yours

77
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,042
Where's my tooth?

78
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,875
- Sir, you're all right, sir?
- I'm all right, it's a miracle

79
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,875
Don't worry, you'll be paid for
that busted window

80
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,542
Ok, Thank you

81
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:18,667
Cause I'm docking it
out of your pay

82
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:22,667
- Well Now, what about that drink?
- Yeah

83
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,750
Sounds good to me

84
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:26,042
No sir, you're gonna simmer down

85
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:29,042
and you're gonna keep a watch
on things now!

86
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,250
- Can you put that back in?
- Yes

87
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:35,250
You couldn't take
this one out, could you?

88
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,375
I think we have to
climb that hill

89
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:02,500
You go on ahead
I ain't fixing to die

90
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,042
Pleased to meet you

91
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:30,917
Looking for those damned
Sacred Mountains, huh?

92
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:48,750
Father Del Rio, may you be
blessed in heaven!

93
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,958
What was that?

94
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:57,958
Prosit

95
00:27:02,667 --> 00:27:04,667
What was that again?

96
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:11,458
Woodhead, I said you are
a pessimist and I am an optimist

97
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,958
You've got to have faith, my friend

98
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,333
I don't have faith in
no one but me

99
00:27:19,167 --> 00:27:21,000
me and old Betty

100
00:27:21,625 --> 00:27:24,792
I promised you gold
I'll give you mountains of gold

101
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,708
They're so close
I can almost smell it

102
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,583
Well, let's get a move on

103
00:27:32,208 --> 00:27:35,167
Yeah well today is
maybe not a good day

104
00:27:35,292 --> 00:27:36,792
What do you mean not a good day?

105
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,083
Well, you know
tomorrow maybe we come back

106
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,583
What do you mean tomorrow?

107
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,792
I've got to

108
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:55,250
Anyway one of us must live

109
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,708
Mike the Conqueror!

110
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:18,125
I told you that horse
won't listen to anybody but me

111
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,375
Easy. Easy

112
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,875
Easy, boy

113
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,458
Hey, hey! You're not gonna
win him like that

114
00:28:53,542 --> 00:28:56,333
- Wait, you're stuck
- What?

115
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,625
You're stuck to me

116
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,917
I'd thought you would've done
better than that

117
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:24,375
Boys, finish them gates!
Marshal!

118
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,792
Sullivan

119
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,167
That's a hard ride

120
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,833
What are you doing
round here, Marshall?

121
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,625
Interested in one of my horses?

122
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:38,917
I heard back in town
that your hand Woodhead

123
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,542
and that Prussian

124
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,833
are crossing the border
on to Chiricahua territory

125
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,917
I don't know anything about that

126
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:53,208
I'll tell you though that
I've send Woodhead up to Riata

127
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,042
to sell some of my horses

128
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:58,625
A pair of mules
holding digging tools?

129
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:02,125
You're accusing me
of something, Marshall?

130
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:06,583
I know about the Prosit's map
to them damned mountains

131
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:11,667
And believe me
it ain't nothing but bullshit

132
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:16,583
Well people around here talk
you know that

133
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:20,958
I know that
But what you should know

134
00:30:21,083 --> 00:30:23,958
is that anyone crossing the border
is breaking the law

135
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:26,250
Is that a fact?

136
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:33,667
You shouldn't get caught up
in this nonsense, Greg

137
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,167
You don't wanna
loose what you got

138
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,542
Father, we should get going

139
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,542
What you want?

140
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:22,750
Well right now, all we want
is somethin' to eat

141
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:30,625
Where's the manuscript?

142
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:35,917
The Del Rio manuscript

143
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Don't have it

144
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:41,292
Don't play dumb with me, because
I know your magic, Indian Witch

145
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,792
Prosit took it

146
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,000
Prosit took it

147
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,875
Don't be afraid

148
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,750
I don't kill animals

149
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,583
Where did you get this?

150
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,958
My Mama gave it to me

151
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,167
And this one here?

152
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:45,458
I bet a pretty Indian girl
gave it to you

153
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,667
How do you know that?

154
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,583
Why else would you spend
so much time in the mountains?

155
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,167
Hey Mike!

156
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:45,958
Hi Pete!

157
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,708
What are you doing here?

158
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,833
What does it look like I'm doing?

159
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,500
Now you two are starting
resembling an old married couple

160
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:09,500
Mr. and Mrs Marshal!

161
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:13,792
Why don't I take you upstairs and
show you what kind of woman I am?

162
00:41:14,583 --> 00:41:16,792
Too much of a woman for me!

163
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,458
Come on here

164
00:41:36,542 --> 00:41:39,042
Playing good tonight, boys?

165
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,833
How about a song?

166
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,667
Chiricahuas!

167
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,417
What happened?

168
00:43:30,208 --> 00:43:31,208
Where's Woodhead?

169
00:43:31,333 --> 00:43:33,708
He is dead!

170
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:35,917
Look what they did to me!

171
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:40,000
You were told not to go
on their territory

172
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:42,208
We were on the road to Riata

173
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:44,500
They attacked us

174
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,500
Well, they've killed
one of our own!

175
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:50,375
What are you gonna do
about that, Marshal?

176
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,083
We can't just sit around here
with our tails between our legs

177
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:57,000
while they try to fence us
in from all sides!

178
00:44:06,042 --> 00:44:07,958
You're a southpaw, huh?

179
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,542
what?

180
00:44:11,042 --> 00:44:13,250
Ain't you left handed?

181
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,625
You say I'm lying?

182
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:20,333
You think I sit on a horse
and do this myself?

183
00:44:20,417 --> 00:44:21,625
And it must have hurt

184
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,208
I am a Prussian Officer!

185
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:28,500
The Von Luckner family is well
respected in Germany for many years

186
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:31,417
I'm a man of science
a geologist

187
00:44:31,542 --> 00:44:33,375
I make maps

188
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:35,667
I've never seen
anything like this!

189
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,000
The whole world's gone mad!

190
00:44:38,583 --> 00:44:42,292
Maybe...
but I'll find out what happened

191
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:44,375
You can bet on that

192
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:48,958
Maybe you're not the right man
for the job, Marshal

193
00:44:49,083 --> 00:44:50,875
It's our land!

194
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,375
You ruined my song

195
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:07,125
A round of drinks on the house
in Woodhead's memory!

196
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,292
She's got cojones
as big as a bull's!

197
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,083
To Woodhead!
May God grant you vengeance!

198
00:45:34,208 --> 00:45:36,875
Sullivan, I found the mountains
I can...

199
00:45:37,583 --> 00:45:39,667
Sullivan, you still need me!

200
00:45:40,042 --> 00:45:41,667
Maybe not

201
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,208
What are you looking at?

202
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:18,792
Move!

203
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,208
Who did this?

204
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,625
You, tell me
What happened?

205
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,917
- Tell me, you son of a bitch
-

206
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,625
which side are you on?)

207
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,083
Are you sure you don't
want me to go with you?

208
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,500
No. I need you here

209
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,917
You know if Woodhead and that Prussian
did travel into their territory

210
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,500
you may not get the welcome
you're used to

211
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:20,042
Jimmy

212
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:25,042
I'll be back in a couple of days
And Jimmy

213
00:47:25,167 --> 00:47:28,958
you better keep your eyes peeled
till Rolling Star relieves you

214
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,667
Yes, sir Marshal
Sir Marshal, Marshal

215
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,458
Damned Cajun!

216
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,833
Go back to your squaw, boy!

217
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:52,500
Get out of here, Indian!

218
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:01,375
Bye, you Indian lover!

219
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:50,375
It's a hot one
ain't it, Sheriff?

220
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,042
Yeah

221
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,333
I'm looking for
a good friend of mine

222
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,333
His name is Prosit

223
00:51:03,458 --> 00:51:07,250
I reckon you'll find him
over at the Venus Hotel

224
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:15,583
All right
Many thanks

225
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,375
Prosit, huh?

226
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,792
Come on Billy
get me over to the saloon, quick!

227
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:31,417
Hey sheriff
we got a wounded one!

228
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:40,292
Holy Mother of God!
Woodhead?

229
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:41,958
Prosit

230
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,833
Where's Prosit?

231
00:51:45,958 --> 00:51:48,542
- what did you say?
- Prosit

232
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,417
I saw the mountains
you have the manuscript...

233
00:51:56,542 --> 00:51:58,500
Sullivan's got it

234
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:02,333
I'll have a drink

235
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:07,125
Now Woody, look, come on
don't make me do anything rash

236
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Come on, take me
back to the office

237
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:16,500
Come on, come on!
Let's get Jimmy. Let's go

238
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,167
And keep it straight!

239
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:24,167
I was there
He was my partner

240
00:52:24,292 --> 00:52:25,458
We were like
blood brothers

241
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:26,958
Woodhead

242
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:30,583
Howdy Pete

243
00:52:32,667 --> 00:52:33,875
Yes?

244
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:37,667
I'm looking for a man
named Prosit

245
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,042
Woodhead!
It's a miracle!

246
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,167
I know what you're gonna say
but look what they did to me

247
00:52:56,417 --> 00:53:00,708
They scalped me
and left me to die

248
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,583
I begged

249
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,208
I prayed to God to give me
the strength to make it back

250
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:14,792
so I could kill you

251
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:45,833
Drop the gun!

252
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,500
I said drop the gun!

253
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,167
You heard the man

254
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,958
You can't leave me
in the same cell!

255
00:54:20,083 --> 00:54:21,875
He's a killer

256
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:26,750
you're breaking my heart!

257
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:32,792
And I thought that
we were partners

258
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:39,292
Wally, my friend!
I thought you were dead

259
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:45,792
It seems
you've been very busy, Prosit

260
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:49,083
What matters is that
you're alive, partner

261
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:53,083
Where's the manuscript?

262
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,208
- Manuscript?
- the manuscript

263
00:54:56,292 --> 00:55:00,583
Ah, that manuscript!
Like the Del Rio manuscript?

264
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:05,833
Eh, I don't have it
But I know who's got it

265
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:09,458
Yeah, I can take you to him

266
00:55:10,667 --> 00:55:14,250
We can find him right now
Well, we can't get out but...

267
00:55:15,542 --> 00:55:18,333
You know we can...
We are partners

268
00:55:19,125 --> 00:55:20,917
We are partners?

269
00:55:24,125 --> 00:55:26,042
It's good to see you, Wally

270
00:55:26,417 --> 00:55:28,125
Likewise

271
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,458
The Marshal is here

272
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,625
Yes

273
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,500
Riata, was it?

274
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Yeah, Woodhead's dead

275
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:30,792
But it wasn't the Chiricahua
that killed him

276
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:33,708
Some shooter came into town today
and finished the job

277
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:36,875
He's sitting over there in your jail

278
00:56:48,958 --> 00:56:51,542
That man shuffles his feet

279
00:57:11,917 --> 00:57:13,208
What's wrong?

280
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:17,375
Well nothing's wrong, darling
Nothing

281
00:57:19,292 --> 00:57:22,500
Here, I'll take that
I'll take it

282
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,167
What was that all about?

283
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:36,458
Oh, just a friendly conversation
between two men

284
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:40,375
Is that so?

285
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:46,250
Well he sure left in an awful hurry
for it being so friendly

286
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:49,750
You're in love with him,
aren't you?

287
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:55,500
Whose side are you on, darling?

288
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,333
I didn't know I had to choose

289
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:02,625
Well, I'm on my side

290
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:45,750
Been real busy

291
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:47,625
Got a full house in there

292
00:58:47,958 --> 00:58:49,125
I heard

293
00:59:06,708 --> 00:59:08,875
You gonna paint my portrait?

294
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:12,792
Hey, what's your name?

295
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,167
Wallace Sebastian Blount

296
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,042
Hey, stranger

297
00:59:30,083 --> 00:59:31,708
You got a light?

298
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:47,208
Most folks used to call me Wally

299
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:52,083
Wally

300
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,000
No, Wally!
Please no, stop it!

301
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,833
Back off!

302
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,583
Stop it!

303
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:54,792
It won't be like it was before

304
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:00,583
You want to see
how a man does it?

305
01:01:00,667 --> 01:01:02,750
Go. Go, Mike!

306
01:01:28,625 --> 01:01:32,125
You don't wanna die over
no whore, Mikee?

307
01:02:24,708 --> 01:02:27,792
You son of a bitch
I thought you were dead

308
01:02:32,417 --> 01:02:33,792
I'll be damned

309
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,792
You're fixing to shoot me
with my own gun!

310
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,500
That ain't right

311
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,083
You're the son of a bitch, Mike

312
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,208
I guess maybe

313
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:48,792
you never got over

314
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,375
that thing what I did

315
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:02,500
In fact
you did me a favour

316
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:05,667
I died, but I came back

317
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:09,500
And now, I'm heading for
the Sacred Mountains

318
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:17,500
But first

319
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:21,208
some truth,

320
01:03:21,209 --> 01:03:22,167
the same way
that you've done for me

321
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,583
Ok

322
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,167
you want what's real?

323
01:03:46,708 --> 01:03:49,292
And I won't deceive you

324
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:09,458
You wanna know
what I saw in the fire?

325
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:19,875
I saw

326
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,083
funny shapes

327
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:34,250
funny little black tongues
licking my soul

328
01:04:48,375 --> 01:04:52,458
I'm going to learn to kill

329
01:04:52,875 --> 01:04:57,167
To kill
with my spirit

330
01:04:58,792 --> 01:05:01,083
It's nice to see you again

331
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:09,542
Mike, Mike
Come on, come on

332
01:05:31,667 --> 01:05:35,167
I think you'd better go
and find your mummy, OK?

333
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:48,833
Follow us

334
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,125
Take me to Runi

335
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:55,417
We get out of this, I'll take you
anywhere you want to go

336
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:57,042
Follow me!

337
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:00,333
Billy, Billy

338
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:05,625
No! no Billy
Billly, no!

339
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,417
No! Billy

340
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,917
Billy!

341
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:21,333
Papa...

342
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,292
Don't do that

343
01:07:04,542 --> 01:07:07,125
You can't shoot me!
Look at the manuscript!

344
01:07:07,333 --> 01:07:09,833
- what for?
- the last pages

345
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,583
I ate them

346
01:07:27,792 --> 01:07:31,083
Wait, you need me
We're partners

347
01:07:37,708 --> 01:07:39,625
I guess I'll have to
cut it out of you

348
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,708
Wait, Wally
We're partners

349
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,417
Hey, this is madness!

350
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,500
We'll pass through now!

351
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,375
Think! Think... Wally
We're partners, Wally

352
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,583
Let's go

353
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:05,583
Schnell!

354
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,208
Ja ja, Schnell

355
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:11,792
You tried to kill me
but the map is in my head

356
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:15,000
Well I hope so
for your sake, partner

357
01:08:22,417 --> 01:08:25,958
Father
Father?

358
01:08:39,583 --> 01:08:44,500
No, no, no

359
01:09:29,083 --> 01:09:31,833
Come on, boys!
Get some water on that thing!

360
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:37,042
Get that through the window here!
Come on! Pump, boys

361
01:09:43,375 --> 01:09:46,750
Hey, Jimmy! You sure you boys
don't want to wait till sun up

362
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,042
get a good night's rest?

363
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,958
You want to tell him
that we wait till the morning?

364
01:09:51,375 --> 01:09:53,458
I've enough shit already

365
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:57,042
I sure I wish
I could ride along with you

366
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:01,667
- you gonna be OK?
- We're gonna be fine. Billy and I

367
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:05,417
Sure sorry about Billy

368
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,333
See you down the road a bit

369
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:13,750
Come on, boys!
Pump it up there! Come on!

370
01:10:28,375 --> 01:10:30,042
Horses are ready, M'dam

371
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:32,667
We've got guns
and supplies for a week

372
01:10:37,542 --> 01:10:39,125
Let's go

373
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:35,417
Runi

374
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:53,292
You ain't gonna drink
that shit, are you?

375
01:14:12,167 --> 01:14:16,667
Runi! Runi!

376
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,250
It's the drink

377
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,750
It must be the drink

378
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:53,625
I don't know why you're
going back to kill them

379
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:56,000
We should leave them
to the Chiricahua

380
01:21:56,917 --> 01:22:00,417
Can't you see how hard
he fights to survive here?

381
01:22:02,208 --> 01:22:04,708
You have no respect for life

382
01:22:35,125 --> 01:22:36,583
What was that?

383
01:22:37,625 --> 01:22:39,083
Just a couple of coyotes

384
01:22:39,208 --> 01:22:41,000
We'll never catch up with them

385
01:22:41,125 --> 01:22:43,125
We don't even know
where we are

386
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:46,000
Well you can turn back
if you'd like

387
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,417
They only killed your uncle

388
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:52,083
So, anybody else want out?

389
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:55,375
You're free to go

390
01:22:57,792 --> 01:23:00,083
You and Charlie take first watch

391
01:25:09,833 --> 01:25:11,833
Sweet Jesus!

392
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:13,250
Maria!

393
01:25:19,542 --> 01:25:20,958
Maria

394
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:24,958
Maria

395
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,958
I'll kill the man responsible

396
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:34,750
I promise you that

397
01:25:38,125 --> 01:25:41,417
He's ok, he's ok
Don't worry

398
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:44,750
He's a friend
It's all right. It's all right

399
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:49,417
I'm sorry

400
01:25:58,042 --> 01:26:01,542
Well, I promised you gold, partner

401
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:03,750
I'll give you mountains of gold

402
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:06,458
Don't even think of trying
anything funny, Prosit!

403
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:09,167
You know the difference
between you and me?

404
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,833
You are a pessimist
I am an optimist

405
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,833
Julio!
Chiricahuas

406
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:23,125
We must head to the canyon!
They won't follow us there

407
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,708
- Which way is it?
- It's that direction!

408
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:33,833
Well I'm happy here

409
01:29:35,958 --> 01:29:41,250
Most men think this here mountain
is just full of gold mines

410
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,542
But I know different

411
01:29:44,375 --> 01:29:46,042
I know the truth

412
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:49,958
I wish I was a spider

413
01:29:50,667 --> 01:29:52,750
I love these creatures

414
01:29:55,875 --> 01:29:58,458
Yes, it must be great to be a spider

415
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,958
If I was a spider
you would squash my head

416
01:30:15,167 --> 01:30:16,833
It is not what I...

417
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:23,875
Yes, you would squash my little
black head, wouldn't you?

418
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:39,417
Animals are beasts
but men are monsters

419
01:30:44,333 --> 01:30:48,333
You are right
Men are

420
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,250
monsters

421
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,458
Father Del Rio

422
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:06,125
You're a saint amongst sinners

423
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:14,208
I'm trying to save my animal spirit

424
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:19,833
Why do I have to be stuck out here
with a pathetic human like you?

425
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:57,375
You know, that tooth's got to
come out one way or another

426
01:33:58,167 --> 01:34:01,458
Easy. Easy

427
01:34:03,958 --> 01:34:06,667
You should have let Runi
take a look at it

428
01:34:06,792 --> 01:34:11,083
No way in hell
I don't want any of his Indian magic

429
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:17,958
I'll end up as crazy as Mike

430
01:37:09,625 --> 01:37:11,917
My goldmine

431
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:23,583
And now
the gold

432
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:18,917
Get up

433
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,875
Get up!

434
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:30,250
We've known each other
for quite some time now

435
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:32,042
mighty Mike

436
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:50,125
It's time to go!

437
01:42:18,083 --> 01:42:20,417
You're a dead soul

438
01:42:21,708 --> 01:42:24,500
You're not welcome here

439
01:42:25,708 --> 01:42:27,417
Why do you say that?

440
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:33,917
You're so lucky

441
01:42:34,708 --> 01:42:38,708
that I owe you so
very much, little boy

442
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:57,500
I was in many shapes
before I was released

443
01:42:57,583 --> 01:42:59,583
And I see...

444
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,083
I see...

445
01:43:02,917 --> 01:43:05,375
I see why I'm here now

446
01:43:06,208 --> 01:43:08,417
To bring you with me

447
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:13,708
I see why we met the first time

448
01:43:14,125 --> 01:43:19,083
To come here
in this world

449
01:43:20,125 --> 01:43:22,167
together

450
01:43:41,083 --> 01:43:45,500
Mike, Mike

451
01:43:46,417 --> 01:43:48,000
Come on

452
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:58,042
Mike, Come on, Mike

453
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:05,667
My love

454
01:44:05,792 --> 01:44:08,875
Hey, how are you doing?

455
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:12,667
You see where love
leads us

456
01:44:16,792 --> 01:44:18,875
Time to see the truth

457
01:44:21,375 --> 01:44:25,500
Come with me, brother
Take my hand

458
01:44:25,583 --> 01:44:28,375
Speak with me
in deep tongues

459
01:44:28,500 --> 01:44:30,667
the language of the dead

460
01:44:50,875 --> 01:44:53,667
It was you Mike
who killed that girl

461
01:44:55,292 --> 01:44:59,583
Sweet little Madeleine
It was you, Mike

462
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:44,625
It is you who must go
and I must wait

463
01:46:35,333 --> 01:46:37,333
You're free now

464
01:46:40,833 --> 01:46:50,625
I love you so. I love you so

465
01:47:01,917 --> 01:47:13,542
I feel her through love

466
01:47:26,625 --> 01:47:31,208
And you will bend
and tell me

467
01:47:32,708 --> 01:47:35,625
that you love me

468
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,583
He's dead

469
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:13,000
And now it's my turn

470
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:17,708
I see

471
01:48:18,708 --> 01:48:27,500
I see my memories

472
01:48:46,792 --> 01:48:51,500
But I don't want to die
Runi! Help! Runi!

473
01:51:48,500 --> 01:51:52,708
I... I love you

474
01:52:04,250 --> 01:52:06,417
I love you too, darling

475
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:10,625
You've been a little rough on me
this last while

476
01:52:47,542 --> 01:52:49,167
She's waiting for you

477
01:53:26,167 --> 01:53:28,500
My mouth's feeling a lot better

478
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,958
Real good baccy this!
