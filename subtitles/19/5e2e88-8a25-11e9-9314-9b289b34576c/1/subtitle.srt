1
00:01:58,498 --> 00:02:00,398
Mom? Knock, knock.

2
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:05,729
It is too early for "Knock, knock."
Come on, eat up. We're running late.

3
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:13,577
Chris, give me a break!

4
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:15,581
Must it be World War II this morning?

5
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,914
World War III.

6
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,683
Cute, kid.

7
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,315
8:30, Cal!

8
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,292
- Why didn't you tell me it was so late?
- I just did.

9
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:29,386
- Dad?
- What?

10
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:30,589
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

11
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:31,824
- Dwayne.
- Dwayne who?

12
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:33,729
Dwayne the bathtub, I'm dwowning!

13
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,631
That's terrible!

14
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:38,835
That's not my lunch, is it?

15
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,430
Not now, it isn't.

16
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:45,872
- When did your friends leave this morning?
- I thought they were your friends.

17
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,905
They left about 3:00.

18
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,211
You used to be able to go all night.

19
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,441
I know, but I can't do it anymore.

20
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,152
What can't you do anymore?

21
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:56,213
Eat your breakfast.

22
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,953
Do you think I should have served
the last drink in my pajamas?

23
00:03:00,294 --> 00:03:02,319
Shoes and socks on. Let's go.

24
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:04,362
Oh, shit.

25
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:05,889
Great.

26
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,024
- Terrific, Cal.
- I got it.

27
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:10,726
Not the socks!

28
00:03:14,908 --> 00:03:17,069
- Hit the showers.
- Right.

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,709
Mom?

30
00:03:28,288 --> 00:03:29,550
What?

31
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,351
Coffee machine.

32
00:03:31,658 --> 00:03:33,319
Perfect!

33
00:03:41,268 --> 00:03:42,360
Mom.

34
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,979
What is it? Jesus!

35
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,107
Lisa, no! Oh, my God, no!

36
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,811
Chris, don't touch her!

37
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,711
Jesus Christ!

38
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:07,683
My God! Christ!

39
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,919
<i>Por favor, don't break nothing!</i>

40
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:58,196
And be careful from the walls.
Mrs. Halliday just painted them.

41
00:06:58,565 --> 00:07:00,328
Follow me, okay?

42
00:07:05,972 --> 00:07:08,031
You did what anyone would have done.

43
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:11,207
It happened so fast. I just reacted.

44
00:07:11,545 --> 00:07:15,879
He was trying to help.
Christ, the man's got four kids!

45
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,639
You'll be more effective...

46
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:21,320
...when you do go back out there,
if you begin to forgive yourself.

47
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,751
That's what this is all about, Frank.
That's how I can help you, if you'll let me.

48
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:28,888
I want to.

49
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:30,890
I do. It's...

50
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:33,121
Good.

51
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:37,802
I'd say we made a pretty good beginning,
wouldn't you?

52
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:40,635
I'll set you up for next week, then.

53
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,403
What have you got there, little guy?

54
00:07:48,582 --> 00:07:50,243
Chief Black Cloud.

55
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:53,912
Are you sick?

56
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,253
I'm sorry.

57
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:00,082
- You can call me anytime.
- Right.

58
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:02,186
See you next Thursday.

59
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:05,754
Hopefully we'll be
a little better settled in by then.

60
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,766
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

61
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,063
Are you all right, Bean?

62
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,540
Not so fast, my friend.

63
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:27,380
From now on, I don't think
you should play in here while I'm working.

64
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,211
Is it a deal?

65
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,392
Okay. What do we got here?

66
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:38,563
Flowers. Mrs. Ruiz and I
are gonna plant some for Mom.

67
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,229
Like these?

68
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,429
Mom wants me to.

69
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you believe me?

70
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,809
I believe she would want you to. Sure.

71
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:58,373
Take it easy, you guys.
I just finished painting this place.

72
00:09:00,687 --> 00:09:03,713
No! My beautiful wall!

73
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,556
I did this wall with my own hands
and now it looks like my first apartment.

74
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,492
- It's just a little gouge.
- It's a giant crater!

75
00:09:10,563 --> 00:09:14,055
I'm gonna have to start from scratch!
Fill it, sand it!

76
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,494
What's the problem?

77
00:09:15,602 --> 00:09:20,164
This. 10 years ago, I wouldn't have cared.
Now I want a wall to look like a wall.

78
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,901
Let me take a look at it.

79
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,433
- You don't have to do that.
- It's okay. I'm taking care of it.

80
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,810
Thank you very much. That's great.

81
00:09:28,014 --> 00:09:29,504
Who says chivalry is dead?

82
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,415
Alive and well in New York. Amazing.

83
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:38,320
How does it feel to have your whole life
stuffed in little boxes?

84
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,957
A little cramped.

85
00:09:42,762 --> 00:09:45,595
Here's the electrician's number.
He's expecting your call.

86
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:49,157
Painter's coming on Sunday.
I'll get to the kitchen faucet soon.

87
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,662
You'll fix it yourself?

88
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:53,071
Sure. I'm the landlady.

89
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:55,733
Hey, listen, I lost an earring...

90
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,334
...maybe in your apartment.
It's pretty hard to miss.

91
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,574
Then, it might be in my bag.
If you see it, will you let me know?

92
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:02,876
I'll keep an eye out.

93
00:10:02,949 --> 00:10:06,544
- Great. How Is Carmen working out?
- Fine. She's terrific with Chris.

94
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,484
Shit!

95
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:12,382
These cops are going to do wonders
for my parking ticket situation.

96
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:14,559
I'll put in a word for you downtown.

97
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:17,720
If there's anything else you need,
I'm across the street.

98
00:10:17,797 --> 00:10:19,059
Officer?

99
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:21,827
Have you started
writing that thing out yet?

100
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:31,174
Look out!

101
00:10:31,978 --> 00:10:35,175
- The ball is in the clear. He scores!
- Wait for me!

102
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,590
Marty Wertheimer, please.

103
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,286
<i>- Who's calling?
- It's Cal Jamison.</i>

104
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,352
<i>- Can you hold?
- Yes, I'll hold.</i>

105
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:57,266
<i>I told you never to call me here.
What do you want? I'm a busy man.</i>

106
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,102
Hi, buddy, how are you?

107
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:03,404
<i>Great. Is that a great apartment
that I found for you all by myself?</i>

108
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,535
<i>And how about the landlady?
Not bad, huh?</i>

109
00:11:05,812 --> 00:11:08,474
Do you know what I had to do to get that?

110
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:11,643
By the way, where's my commission?

111
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:15,281
Shut up already. You done great.
It's wonderful. No complaints.

112
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,116
<i>Where are you? You're late.</i>

113
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,452
I'm in the park.

114
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:22,824
<i>- The park? You're supposed to be here.
- I'm on my way. I've got Chris with me.</i>

115
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:23,885
<i>Great.</i>

116
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:26,329
<i>- It's okay if I bring him?
- Yeah, please.</i>

117
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,162
Okay. See you soon.

118
00:11:33,406 --> 00:11:34,737
Chris!

119
00:11:48,922 --> 00:11:51,982
This is unusual for Central Park.
What are you doing down here?

120
00:11:52,058 --> 00:11:54,652
What do you mean? I run here everyday.

121
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:57,787
- Did you see anyone else here?
- No. Just me.

122
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:59,889
- Is this all you saw?
- That's all I saw!

123
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:02,093
Calm down, miss.
What are you doing here?

124
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:06,036
I run here every day with my friend!
Today, she had to go to the dentist.

125
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,232
- I'll need some information.
- Information?

126
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:09,832
What kind of information?

127
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:12,002
- Like your name first, please.
- My name?

128
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,138
My name is Muriel Greenburg.

129
00:12:15,348 --> 00:12:18,283
Do you spell Greenburg: G-r-e-e-n-b-e-r-g?

130
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,745
No. B-u-r-g. Greenburg.

131
00:12:22,856 --> 00:12:25,017
I may need more information later on.

132
00:12:25,158 --> 00:12:26,489
What's your address?

133
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:29,887
Sorry.

134
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,727
Come on.

135
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:36,526
Folks, the show is over!

136
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:40,672
I'm sure you can find something
better to do than look at this garbage.

137
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,367
Come on, start moving.

138
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,738
Get out of here, let's go.

139
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,872
Keep moving.

140
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,311
<i>Brujería.</i>

141
00:12:49,115 --> 00:12:50,582
Keep going.

142
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:51,809
<i>Brujería.</i>

143
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:53,876
All right, just keep going away.

144
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,382
Dad, do you believe in God?

145
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:00,482
I believe in a god.

146
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:03,126
What you got there?

147
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:04,352
May I?

148
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,531
- Where'd you get this?
- Found it.

149
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:11,661
- Where?
- In the park.

150
00:13:12,372 --> 00:13:13,896
Where in the park?

151
00:13:13,973 --> 00:13:16,533
Somewhere. It's a wishing shell.

152
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:17,974
How do you know that?

153
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,142
I just do.

154
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:22,812
Where is he?

155
00:13:24,484 --> 00:13:25,883
There he is.

156
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:28,283
- Hi, Marty.
- Chris, how are you doing?

157
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:30,481
I've been waiting all morning for you.

158
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,854
- How are you?
- Who's this bum?

159
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:35,486
You have to watch these guys
who hang out in the park.

160
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:37,153
- What's this?
- What?

161
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,654
Bubble-gum?

162
00:13:38,731 --> 00:13:40,756
Don't you know where to park your gum?

163
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,267
- Where?
- On the bedpost, for crying out loud.

164
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:47,602
You got any questions about important
stuff like this, you come ask your lawyer.

165
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:50,006
- Okay.
- Okay. I ever show you this one?

166
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,002
Twice.

167
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:56,610
Okay, wise guy, you get them apart.
I'll bring him right back. Promise.

168
00:13:56,783 --> 00:13:57,841
- Coffee?
- No.

169
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,885
One. Regular. Thanks.

170
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,522
Wait a minute.
We agree, so what's the problem?

171
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:11,085
I don't have a problem
with the idea of a lawsuit.

172
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,792
I don't want Chris to have to relive it all.

173
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:14,992
Neither do I.

174
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,332
But that coffee machine
was fuckin' defective...

175
00:14:17,403 --> 00:14:19,894
...and we gotta nail them
so no one else is killed.

176
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,601
So long as Chris
doesn't have to testify. I mean it.

177
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,508
- I feel very strongly about this.
- You and me both.

178
00:14:25,712 --> 00:14:29,478
This will not go to trial.
I promise you. They'd be crazy.

179
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:31,517
They'll settle. Do you smoke?

180
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:32,812
No, thanks, I quit.

181
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:35,911
Yeah, me too.
I quit at least twice this week already.

182
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:39,183
Thanks.

183
00:14:40,393 --> 00:14:43,294
I love Chris, you know that.
He's a great kid.

184
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:48,065
Tell you the truth,
he's not the one I'm worried about.

185
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:58,677
- I'm all right.
- That's it? "I'm all right"?

186
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,412
You spend your time
listening to cops' problems...

187
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:03,381
...you can't talk about your own?

188
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:07,216
It's lonely.

189
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:08,743
Yeah?

190
00:15:09,322 --> 00:15:11,654
I'm trying to pick up the pieces.

191
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,386
It really feels strange being back.

192
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,221
The city's changed a lot.

193
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:23,428
Some days I'm not so sure
it was a good idea to bring Chris here.

194
00:15:23,836 --> 00:15:26,532
But in a funny way,
it's brought us closer together.

195
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:30,699
You need anything at all,
I'm there before you hang up the phone.

196
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,242
I know.

197
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,780
- I feel better. You?
- I feel better.

198
00:15:36,849 --> 00:15:38,282
Sit down.

199
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:42,517
Linda? You want to send in
Mr. Jamison, Esquire, please?

200
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:49,492
What is this?

201
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,223
My 11:00 number.

202
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:53,026
Come on in, kid. Sit down.

203
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,060
Get a load o' this.

204
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:17,283
I win.

205
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,818
Cheater.

206
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:25,263
Hi, Carmen. Any calls?

207
00:16:25,364 --> 00:16:26,922
No calls.

208
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,224
But this come for you.

209
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,227
From where?

210
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,862
It's a housewarming present
from Mrs. Halliday.

211
00:16:34,774 --> 00:16:37,834
- She make it herself, for you.
- Wasn't that nice?

212
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,111
<i>It's very beautiful, si?</i>

213
00:16:47,453 --> 00:16:48,886
<i>Si.</i>

214
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,719
Stunning.

215
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:10,435
- Are there any more of these perishables?
- This is only dry stuff and spices.

216
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,944
- And did you buy this radio here?
- In London.

217
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:15,412
I'll have to take this apart. I'll put it back.

218
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:17,881
<i>Arriving passengers
who have cleared customs...</i>

219
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,350
<i>... place your luggage
on the conveyor belt...</i>

220
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:22,011
Could I see that?

221
00:17:30,796 --> 00:17:32,229
Open this, please.

222
00:17:32,298 --> 00:17:34,198
Just personal items.

223
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,529
No need to look in there.

224
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:50,814
All right.

225
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:12,427
Remember this bowl?
That little Indian boy made it.

226
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:16,771
- We have one just like it.
- You do? I love the things he made.

227
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,968
Vino? Where's the vino?

228
00:18:19,378 --> 00:18:22,040
- And cilantro.
- How's it going?

229
00:18:23,849 --> 00:18:25,214
Ambrosia.

230
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:28,347
- Ambrosia!
- Taste.

231
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:32,950
Well? What do you think?
Don't be bashful.

232
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:34,890
- I'm inured to criticism.
- Hot.

233
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:39,328
Nonsense. Good for you.
Therapeutic, anti-depressant.

234
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,593
- News to me.
- I stand before you, living proof.

235
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:47,400
You put the NYPD on gumbo twice a week,
and you're out of business.

236
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:51,669
Why don't you give that a good stir
and then we'll bring in the rice.

237
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,778
Useless knife. I'll have to get another.

238
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,183
It's lovely.

239
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:00,742
Who gave it to you?

240
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,878
I found it.

241
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:04,787
Really? Here. Show it to Dennis.

242
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:07,516
- What's this?
- My shell.

243
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,188
- It's your shell, is it?
- Yep.

244
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,698
You seem pretty sure about that.

245
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,168
It's a beautiful piece of work.
Have you seen this?

246
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:18,528
Yes.

247
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:23,906
You still got that thing, Chris?
That's his wishing shell.

248
00:19:25,278 --> 00:19:29,408
What do you suppose
you could make out of this?

249
00:19:30,683 --> 00:19:32,048
I don't know.

250
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:34,583
What about a necklace?

251
00:19:38,124 --> 00:19:41,685
That's the day we went to Osage.
The reservation. Remember that?

252
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:44,821
- Remember that?
- And the day I got Chief Black Cloud.

253
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,194
That's right.

254
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,165
And Dennis bought me the arrowheads.

255
00:19:48,367 --> 00:19:50,460
God. Got a memory like an elephant.

256
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:56,397
There's Mom.

257
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:00,068
She looked so pretty.

258
00:20:00,413 --> 00:20:02,745
That was a very happy day, wasn't it?

259
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,243
My prize pupil.

260
00:20:05,384 --> 00:20:06,874
In anthropology?

261
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:09,520
I always thought one day,
she'd be teaching me.

262
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:15,757
Look at that face.

263
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:22,089
That was the day
we went to visit the Ojibwa. Remember?

264
00:20:22,468 --> 00:20:24,629
About 40 degrees below zero.

265
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,769
They had fires inside the tent.

266
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:31,841
It must have been 70 degrees below,
with the wind chill.

267
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,445
It was quite a day, wasn't it?

268
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,446
I'm sorry.

269
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:42,085
I remember taking those pictures.

270
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:46,357
That was the last time
we were all together.

271
00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:51,856
Oh, my.

272
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:03,202
How does Chris seem to you?
Does he seem all right?

273
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:09,875
- He's a remarkable little boy.
- I think he's doing all right, actually.

274
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,915
Thanks.

275
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:41,045
The kitchen all fixed up, Dr. Jamison.

276
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:42,341
Thank you, Carmen.

277
00:21:42,481 --> 00:21:44,108
<i>- Hasta mañana.
- Hasta mañana.</i>

278
00:21:44,517 --> 00:21:47,509
<i>- Buenas noches.
- Buenas noches.</i>

279
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:32,484
We've got to stay back here.

280
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:34,617
Sorry, you can't get through here.

281
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,959
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

282
00:23:57,283 --> 00:23:59,012
- Lopez call this in?
- He did.

283
00:23:59,084 --> 00:24:01,882
- Where is he?
- Behind the screen. We can't get near him.

284
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,148
Keeps asking for you.

285
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,713
- What do you got?
- We got a dead kid.

286
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:12,294
<i>I want you to understand that! Brujería.</i>

287
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:16,960
How old is he?

288
00:24:17,036 --> 00:24:19,630
He looks to be about 9 years old.
He's only a kid.

289
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:24,267
There's so much blood. Look at the ashes.
They're right around where the body was.

290
00:24:26,045 --> 00:24:27,945
Jesus Christ almighty.

291
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:32,240
Just get McTaggert here, that's all.

292
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:38,155
Don't you come any closer, all right?

293
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,620
Don't do it. Quit fucking around with me!

294
00:24:40,693 --> 00:24:43,491
Nobody's fucking around with you.
Did you call this in?

295
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:45,655
- Yes, Lieutenant.
- What's the problem?

296
00:24:45,731 --> 00:24:48,256
Jesus Christ,
did you see what they did to that kid?

297
00:24:48,934 --> 00:24:51,095
I saw. What do you know about it?

298
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,933
- They took my badge.
- Who took your badge?

299
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,664
Who took it, Tom?

300
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,540
You don't know what they could do to me.

301
00:24:58,611 --> 00:25:01,739
You did a good job, now we're here.
Let us have it.

302
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,144
We'll go to the station and make a report.

303
00:25:04,216 --> 00:25:05,205
No!

304
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,812
You can't stop them.

305
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,618
You can't do anything.

306
00:25:13,058 --> 00:25:14,821
You don't understand anything.

307
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:25,363
It doesn't work!

308
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,709
I'll be safe.

309
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:36,744
Get the gun!

310
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,843
Get him the hell out of here, fast!

311
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:41,610
Why did you stop me?

312
00:25:41,754 --> 00:25:43,551
We can't do anything!

313
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,057
<i>Brujería.</i>

314
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,887
McTaggert. Get it straight!

315
00:25:53,098 --> 00:25:54,827
They know who I am!

316
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,134
Let go! I'm a cop, too! Goddamn you!

317
00:26:54,593 --> 00:26:57,426
I'm here, Chris! It's all right.

318
00:26:57,763 --> 00:26:59,958
It's all right, sweetheart.

319
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,023
It's just a bad dream.

320
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,096
It's all right, baby.

321
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:35,132
<i>- Hello?
- Is this Dr. Jamison?</i>

322
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,189
Speaking.

323
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:40,100
Good. This is Lt. McTaggert, 27th Precinct.

324
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:42,201
<i>What can I do for you, Lieutenant?</i>

325
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:45,402
I'm sorry, but I got your number
from Psych Services.

326
00:27:45,477 --> 00:27:49,243
I'm at Bellevue.
I've got an officer in a lot of trouble here.

327
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:52,242
<i>You want me to come down now?</i>

328
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,909
I'd appreciate that.

329
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,013
It's McTaggert. I'll be waiting for you
at Psychiatric Emergency.

330
00:27:59,224 --> 00:28:01,624
<i>All right, give me about 20 minutes.</i>

331
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:11,227
I understand you were working undercover
on the disappearance...

332
00:28:11,303 --> 00:28:14,101
...of some kids in Spanish Harlem.
Is that right, Tom?

333
00:28:15,541 --> 00:28:16,803
May I call you Tom?

334
00:28:18,944 --> 00:28:20,070
Are you Catholic?

335
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,810
Yes, I am. I'm not a practicing Catholic.

336
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,946
They know who I am!

337
00:28:29,822 --> 00:28:31,483
Who are "they"?

338
00:28:31,557 --> 00:28:34,924
No. How do I know about you?

339
00:28:36,628 --> 00:28:38,152
I understand.

340
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,326
You have no reason to trust me,
but why distrust me?

341
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,332
The spirits help them.
They walk through walls.

342
00:28:47,606 --> 00:28:49,506
- Don't forget that.
- I won't.

343
00:28:50,943 --> 00:28:53,434
They can see us in here now, is that it?

344
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:58,312
What is it? Easy.

345
00:29:02,454 --> 00:29:07,414
They knew that I was on to them.
I walked in and they were waiting for me.

346
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:11,823
- Can you identify them?
- No. When I came to, I found the body.

347
00:29:15,634 --> 00:29:18,467
They got my shield. Don't you get it?

348
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:22,470
They're going to kill me.

349
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:25,870
I can feel it's started already.

350
00:29:26,945 --> 00:29:29,937
Nobody can harm you in here.
I promise you that.

351
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:34,546
God can't save you.
The church can't save you.

352
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:38,348
They get right inside your body!
You can't stop them.

353
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:40,254
Seven powers.

354
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,619
You think that you can stop them?

355
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,592
You think science can stop them?

356
00:29:47,232 --> 00:29:48,722
It's all right.

357
00:29:48,901 --> 00:29:50,528
The eyes.

358
00:29:51,069 --> 00:29:53,560
I saw his eyes!

359
00:29:53,906 --> 00:29:55,737
Whose eyes?

360
00:30:00,479 --> 00:30:03,243
They can get to anyone.
They can kill anybody!

361
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:06,675
You want them to know who you are?

362
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,285
Do you?

363
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:15,053
- Do you think he'll come out of it?
- I need more time with him.

364
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:18,392
- He was one of my best guys.
- Maybe I should see the victim.

365
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,361
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

366
00:30:20,432 --> 00:30:22,093
It's the kid's parents.

367
00:30:39,318 --> 00:30:40,444
Jesus.

368
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:44,586
What kind of a monster does that?

369
00:31:00,739 --> 00:31:02,866
Been down to the freezer again?

370
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,199
You're a real comedian.

371
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:08,942
Don't be a stranger. Hit me again.

372
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,983
No, thank you. Just coffee, please.

373
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:21,826
Did we treat cops for alcohol abuse
back in Milwaukee?

374
00:31:21,893 --> 00:31:23,326
Minneapolis.

375
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:25,289
Hello, Minneapolis.

376
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,958
What the hell brought you to New York?
You don't mind my asking?

377
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,898
I went to graduate school at Columbia.

378
00:31:31,003 --> 00:31:34,439
Nice school, shitty neighborhood.
You got a family?

379
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,263
I have a son.

380
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:38,140
Thank you.

381
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:42,603
I lost my wife recently.

382
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:46,077
I'm sorry to hear that.

383
00:31:46,818 --> 00:31:48,877
What did Lopez have on this?

384
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:50,882
<i>Nada. Nothing.</i>

385
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,587
Can I see his reports?

386
00:31:53,658 --> 00:31:54,647
No.

387
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:56,090
Why not?

388
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:59,426
- They're not available.
- Hope you're off duty, Lieutenant.

389
00:31:59,498 --> 00:32:00,624
Fuck off.

390
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:01,958
Is Lopez Catholic?

391
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:04,427
Sure. The family is Cuban.

392
00:32:05,003 --> 00:32:07,631
They practice a thing called Santería.
Ever hear of it?

393
00:32:07,706 --> 00:32:08,695
No.

394
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:11,207
It's a Latin thing. A lot of them are into it.

395
00:32:11,276 --> 00:32:14,541
They cut up chickens, magic, shit like that.

396
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:18,012
- And Lopez is into this?
- He kept it quiet.

397
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:22,480
He found the body on an altar
with a lot of religious paraphernalia, right?

398
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:25,284
There's at least 200 places
that sell that shit.

399
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:29,350
Wait a second. I'm evaluating a patient.
That's a pretty strong lead.

400
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:32,597
A citizen's got a right
to his own religious preference.

401
00:32:32,664 --> 00:32:36,031
If he performs a human sacrifice,
I'd say he forfeits that right.

402
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:39,468
A psycho kills a kid,
he makes it look like a religious ritual.

403
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:43,804
That kid was cut up with the precision
of a surgeon, not a psychopath.

404
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:46,342
What are you afraid of,
that Lopez is a suspect?

405
00:32:46,711 --> 00:32:48,611
That it's one of your own?

406
00:32:49,648 --> 00:32:51,206
It's not this religion?

407
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,408
I don't call cutting up chickens a religion!

408
00:32:55,821 --> 00:33:00,155
If you knew the barrio the way I do,
you wouldn't ask such dumb questions.

409
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:01,715
That's bullshit.

410
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:03,690
Just one last question.

411
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:07,765
Is this all the assistance I'll get
trying to help that officer?

412
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:10,534
Think about it.

413
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:12,463
Thanks for the coffee.

414
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,844
Oh, no! My clothes!

415
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:43,759
<i>"Santería is 1,000 years older
than Christianity...</i>

416
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:49,068
<i>"...brought by slaves to the Caribbean.</i>

417
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,311
<i>"Their African gods are hidden in
Catholic saints.</i>

418
00:33:58,049 --> 00:33:59,380
<i>"Chango.</i>

419
00:33:59,985 --> 00:34:01,577
<i>"Santa Barbara.</i>

420
00:34:02,888 --> 00:34:04,651
<i>"Elegua is Saint Anthony."</i>

421
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:47,996
Come on, get this cleaned up.

422
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:03,575
God.

423
00:36:05,176 --> 00:36:06,234
Hi.

424
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,400
Hi.

425
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,440
You forgot your watch.

426
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:10,807
Did I?

427
00:36:11,683 --> 00:36:14,243
You must have left it
when you were painting.

428
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:18,482
You forgot these, too.
They're a little soggy.

429
00:36:18,623 --> 00:36:19,612
Thanks.

430
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:21,716
Still can't find the earring.

431
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,658
Want to come in?

432
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:30,731
Thank you.

433
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:23,854
I have no idea what I would I have done
without the watch.

434
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:27,517
You suppose my leaving it
was some hidden expression of desire?

435
00:37:27,826 --> 00:37:31,159
I don't know that,
but my returning it certainly was.

436
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,230
How long has it been?

437
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:42,095
About nine months.

438
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:46,000
Would she approve?

439
00:37:47,479 --> 00:37:48,810
I approve.

440
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:54,612
I went a whole year after my divorce.

441
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:58,245
When was that?

442
00:37:59,257 --> 00:38:00,884
About a year ago.

443
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,820
But who's counting?

444
00:38:06,898 --> 00:38:09,389
Didn't you used to live in New York?

445
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,401
Back when I was young and foolish.

446
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:13,667
What does that make you now?

447
00:38:22,814 --> 00:38:24,805
I should probably get back.

448
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,621
Hurry up or we'll miss the show!

449
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:43,824
There's time for at least
another half a glass.

450
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:45,426
As you wish, madam.

451
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:48,167
And you, madam.
How about you, Carmen?

452
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,729
<i>No, gracias.</i>

453
00:38:49,808 --> 00:38:52,174
Come on, you're no stranger to the grape.

454
00:38:52,677 --> 00:38:56,443
Sounds like fun. I haven't been
to the Planetarium since I was a girl.

455
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:58,175
Why don't you join us?

456
00:38:58,616 --> 00:39:00,516
As we begin our journey...

457
00:39:00,652 --> 00:39:02,415
...to the beginning of time...

458
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,294
What are you looking for?

459
00:39:10,528 --> 00:39:12,860
- Where's my shell?
- I don't know.

460
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:15,628
Where is it? Did she take it?

461
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,292
Just a minute, young man!

462
00:39:17,535 --> 00:39:19,230
Come back here!

463
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:24,705
What are you doing?

464
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:26,773
- It was an accident!
- It was not!

465
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,073
It was!

466
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:30,579
- I'll go.
- Don't worry about it.

467
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,006
- It's no big deal.
- He's tired.

468
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,142
- I'll get it, Carmen.
- It's no problem.

469
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,812
Just a minute, what is that?

470
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:39,883
That's one of my hankies. May I?

471
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:46,292
- What did she say?
- She said that she did it. It's not bad.

472
00:39:51,569 --> 00:39:54,231
She says she's a kind of matchmaker.

473
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:56,236
A yenta. Do you know what that is?

474
00:39:56,307 --> 00:39:58,537
What's that got to do with this?

475
00:40:00,011 --> 00:40:01,638
That's my earring.

476
00:40:05,083 --> 00:40:07,574
She said she cast a love spell on us.

477
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:11,021
- That's ridiculous.
- I'm sorry you feel that way.

478
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:14,684
This is nothing bad.
You're such a nice couple.

479
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,954
Don't look at me.

480
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:20,691
I like a guy, maybe I'll change my perfume,
but I've got my pride.

481
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,604
<i>This is Lt. Mc Taggert.</i>

482
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,466
What can I do for you?

483
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,437
<i>- Has Tom Lopez called you?
- No, why?</i>

484
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:39,108
<i>He took a hike from Bellevue last night.
You better get over here.</i>

485
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:40,206
<i>What is it?</i>

486
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:43,448
<i>We got another kid like the one
from the movie house.</i>

487
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,088
<i>Pier 11.</i>

488
00:40:52,864 --> 00:40:54,695
Look over there. What is that?

489
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:01,794
Lieutenant.

490
00:41:01,873 --> 00:41:04,034
The body is down here.

491
00:41:04,242 --> 00:41:06,005
Worse than the one before.

492
00:41:06,177 --> 00:41:07,439
How old is he?

493
00:41:07,912 --> 00:41:11,245
8. 10. No I.D. He's a black kid.

494
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,880
Watch your step. It's a tough climb.

495
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:16,578
They didn't tell me this was part of the job.

496
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:19,018
They don't tell you a lot of things.

497
00:41:31,169 --> 00:41:33,330
It's just like the kid in the theatre.

498
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,964
He's been here a couple of days.

499
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,533
You got the red and black candles,
and the circle of ashes.

500
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,606
And a bottle of gasoline.

501
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,774
- Look at the way he's cut up.
- So much blood.

502
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:09,130
Jesus Christ!

503
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:11,769
How do you ever get used to it?

504
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,342
You don't.

505
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,641
Now maybe you know why
a lot of cops hit the bottle.

506
00:42:17,582 --> 00:42:18,913
Listen, Doc.

507
00:42:20,018 --> 00:42:24,751
Newspapers find out some psycho cop
is doing this, my job gets shittier than it is.

508
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:27,017
Do me a favor.
No details to anybody, huh?

509
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,490
Psycho cop?

510
00:42:30,094 --> 00:42:33,894
Do you think a few hours on the couch
and Lopez will get himself together?

511
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,865
You don't know that he did it.

512
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:39,994
I don't know that he didn't.
Lopez hasn't called you, has he?

513
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:41,299
No.

514
00:42:43,374 --> 00:42:46,207
Weird fucking city you moved into, Doc.

515
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,124
Lopez.

516
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:16,260
Excuse me.
Could I talk to you for a second, please?

517
00:44:16,334 --> 00:44:17,460
What do you want?

518
00:44:18,102 --> 00:44:22,368
I'm looking for the man that wrote this.
Oscar Sezine. Is he here?

519
00:44:23,107 --> 00:44:24,267
We're closed.

520
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:28,540
I just need a minute of his time.
Believe me, it's very important.

521
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:31,238
- There is no one here.
- Wait a second.

522
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:34,043
Sir!

523
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,381
I'm with Psych Services...

524
00:44:37,522 --> 00:44:38,853
...NYPD!

525
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:44,925
Thanks a lot!

526
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:16,923
Carmen.

527
00:45:18,229 --> 00:45:20,720
What is all this stuff?
What are these things?

528
00:45:21,065 --> 00:45:23,158
You put them in Chris's room, didn't you?

529
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:25,168
<i>- Si.
- I want to know why.</i>

530
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:27,101
To bless him. I'm trying to help him.

531
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,162
I'm trying to help him, too.

532
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:32,303
Sometimes these are used in rituals,
aren't they?

533
00:45:34,212 --> 00:45:35,201
<i>Si.</i>

534
00:45:35,279 --> 00:45:39,272
Sometimes those rituals
involve animal sacrifice, don't they?

535
00:45:40,251 --> 00:45:41,741
Sometimes.

536
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:45,419
What is the circle of ashes for?

537
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,055
Circle of ashes?
I don't know nothing about that.

538
00:45:49,694 --> 00:45:51,787
- That's not a part of Santería?
- No.

539
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:59,299
If I find this kind of stuff around here again,
I'll have to let you go, is that clear?

540
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:00,530
<i>This is for protección.</i>

541
00:46:00,605 --> 00:46:03,802
I don't care what it's for.
It's a lot of superstitious nonsense.

542
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:06,635
And I don't want
any more of it in the house.

543
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:10,906
Do you want any of these,
'cause I'm going to throw them away.

544
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:21,722
Which one of these guys do you want?

545
00:46:21,792 --> 00:46:24,590
How about that guy? He looks pretty neat.

546
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,663
It's your birthday,
you can have any one you want.

547
00:46:28,733 --> 00:46:31,224
Come on, Bean,
you've gotta make up your mind.

548
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,935
- I'll take that.
- This one?

549
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:37,834
Happy birthday, sir.

550
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:40,473
What do you say to Jessica?

551
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:42,173
Thanks.

552
00:46:43,848 --> 00:46:45,406
Why are you so sad today?

553
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:47,542
Three ices, please. Hurry up, you guys.

554
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:48,641
Lemon.

555
00:46:48,786 --> 00:46:51,346
- What flavor do you want?
- I don't want any.

556
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:52,855
Come on, sure you do.

557
00:46:53,157 --> 00:46:54,488
No, I don't!

558
00:46:55,092 --> 00:46:56,423
I'm sorry.

559
00:46:58,562 --> 00:47:00,052
- This is really...
- No!

560
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,543
- Goddamn it!
- No!

561
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:23,114
- Don't you ever...
- I don't want toys or anything from her!

562
00:47:23,421 --> 00:47:25,446
She's not my mom! I want my mom!

563
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,148
Shut up and listen!
Do you know you almost killed yourself!

564
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,818
I want my mom!

565
00:47:31,195 --> 00:47:33,129
Come back here!

566
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:43,634
Happy birthday, Chris!

567
00:47:50,247 --> 00:47:51,680
I'm sorry.

568
00:47:53,284 --> 00:47:55,149
I'm so sorry if I hurt you.

569
00:47:55,753 --> 00:47:57,050
Listen to me.

570
00:47:57,254 --> 00:48:00,781
You know I loved your mother very much,
and I'll always love her.

571
00:48:00,891 --> 00:48:02,222
But she's gone now.

572
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:04,988
- You don't care that she went away!
- That's not true.

573
00:48:05,062 --> 00:48:07,189
You wouldn't care if I went away!

574
00:48:07,298 --> 00:48:10,165
- You know that's not true.
- You hit me!

575
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:13,670
I'm sorry I hit you.
I promise I'll never hit you again.

576
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:15,830
I'll never do anything to hurt you.

577
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:19,132
You mean more to me
than anyone else in the world.

578
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,905
Don't you know that?

579
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,841
I love you so much.

580
00:48:29,086 --> 00:48:30,747
Please forgive me.

581
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,215
I just wanted him
to have a really nice birthday.

582
00:48:35,292 --> 00:48:38,125
- He still can.
- It's not over yet.

583
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:41,588
- I didn't mean any harm.
- Of course you didn't.

584
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:44,528
You know how children are
with new people.

585
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:47,531
Dr. Jamison.

586
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:53,733
I'll take it up here!

587
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:56,939
Hello.

588
00:48:57,081 --> 00:48:59,174
<i>- It's Lopez.
- Where are you?</i>

589
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,185
There's a diner on 126th and Lexington.

590
00:49:03,154 --> 00:49:06,214
Come alone, okay? Just you.

591
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:07,755
<i>What do you mean?</i>

592
00:49:08,759 --> 00:49:11,592
You're in danger.
You and your son. Hurry.

593
00:50:50,461 --> 00:50:51,985
Are you okay?

594
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:53,588
<i>Si.</i>

595
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:56,126
<i>Agua, por favor. Caliente.</i>

596
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:57,286
<i>Qué pasa?</i>

597
00:52:37,101 --> 00:52:38,830
It's all right. Let him through.

598
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:42,095
- What are you doing here?
- Lopez called me and told me to come.

599
00:52:42,206 --> 00:52:45,039
Why didn't you call me?
We're supposed to work together.

600
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:47,634
Please, ma'am, stand back.

601
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:50,412
- Did you know him?
- No. I don't.

602
00:52:51,115 --> 00:52:54,175
- He was never here before?
- I've never seen him.

603
00:52:56,353 --> 00:52:58,548
What did he tell you when he called?

604
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:00,817
Nothing. He just told me to meet him.

605
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,460
Did you understand
anything he was saying?

606
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:06,963
<i>Yes. He kept saying, "Culebras!"</i>

607
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:08,725
Who the hell is Culebras?

608
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:11,357
Nobody, sir. That means "snakes."

609
00:53:11,535 --> 00:53:12,934
Snakes?

610
00:53:14,972 --> 00:53:18,806
Did he do anything else
before he started screaming?

611
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:23,980
He was writing, and then he took the knife
and stabbed himself.

612
00:53:24,081 --> 00:53:28,017
- Where did he get the knife?
- From behind the counter. I was using it.

613
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:30,752
Does that mean anything to you?

614
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:42,524
I'm talking to you in English,
you're talking to her in Spanish.

615
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,263
What is this, a three-ring circus?
Are you giving me a hard time?

616
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:50,667
- I'm not giving you a hard time.
- Are these all the files?

617
00:54:08,792 --> 00:54:10,453
Oscar Sezine?

618
00:54:11,161 --> 00:54:13,391
Why wouldn't you talk to me before?

619
00:54:13,797 --> 00:54:15,458
Did you bring the police here?

620
00:54:15,532 --> 00:54:17,557
- Hey, you, Sezine.
- Yes?

621
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:19,795
Get in here. I want to talk to you.

622
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:24,237
Who is this guy? A friend of yours?

623
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,510
What the hell is this place, anyway?

624
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:32,210
This is a licensed drug rehab center?

625
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:35,680
Our doors are open to troubled children.
We offer them help.

626
00:54:35,753 --> 00:54:37,914
Even your own kid OD'd.

627
00:54:38,889 --> 00:54:39,878
Yes.

628
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:42,718
Is that why you're here?

629
00:54:42,793 --> 00:54:43,987
Hey, wise guy.

630
00:54:44,061 --> 00:54:47,895
I'm here to talk to you about Tom Lopez.
Did you know he was a cop?

631
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:52,026
Yes. He's also a volunteer on staff.
He teaches boxing.

632
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:54,604
- Coaches our Golden Gloves.
- Not anymore.

633
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:56,733
He killed himself an hour ago.

634
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:03,746
- I'm shocked.
- I bet you are.

635
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:10,147
Is this kid here, Louis Montana,
part of your drug rehabilitation program?

636
00:55:10,687 --> 00:55:13,622
He was. He ran away last week.

637
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,885
- Did you see him after he ran away?
- No.

638
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:19,519
- Did Lopez know him?
- He coached him.

639
00:55:19,596 --> 00:55:21,223
You saw them together?

640
00:55:21,398 --> 00:55:22,387
Yes, why?

641
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:25,799
We found Louis Montana's body
on a Hudson River barge yesterday.

642
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:28,997
- Would you know anything about that?
- Certainly not.

643
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:33,440
You have a right to remain silent.
Anything you say can be used against you.

644
00:55:33,977 --> 00:55:37,777
You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one, we'll provide one.

645
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,338
Is that clear?

646
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:42,909
You! Get out of here!

647
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:44,380
Fuck off.

648
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:47,680
You know what I'd like to do?

649
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:50,625
I'd like to put this monkey on a grill
and fry his ass...

650
00:55:50,694 --> 00:55:54,858
...until I get some answers about this
Santería bullshit from you people.

651
00:55:55,265 --> 00:55:59,395
That's my number at the precinct.
Call me tomorrow. Don't forget.

652
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:03,662
He hasn't slept for two days.

653
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:09,145
If you're not a cop, what are you?

654
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:13,307
I'm a therapist.
Tom Lopez is one of my patients.

655
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,718
I'm really very sorry about all this.

656
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,851
Do you really think we are savages?

657
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:26,885
That we are capable of killing children?

658
00:56:28,065 --> 00:56:32,297
You said in your book that human sacrifice
was practiced at one time.

659
00:56:32,402 --> 00:56:36,896
Name one religion where atrocities have
not been committed in the name of a god.

660
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,137
Santería is a force for good.

661
00:56:41,345 --> 00:56:44,075
It is not a blood-cult
trading on innocent lives!

662
00:56:44,181 --> 00:56:47,412
- What are you people so afraid of?
- Of your ignorance.

663
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:51,984
Of your prejudice,
because you use it as a weapon against us.

664
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,614
Tom Lopez was a good and decent man.

665
00:56:56,026 --> 00:56:58,017
He was devoted to these children.

666
00:56:59,096 --> 00:57:03,624
I don't believe he committed suicide
or had anything to do with that outrage!

667
00:57:05,369 --> 00:57:06,529
Neither do I.

668
00:57:11,975 --> 00:57:14,170
Robert Calder
is the chairman of your board?

669
00:57:14,778 --> 00:57:16,746
Yes. He's our major contributor.

670
00:57:18,148 --> 00:57:20,139
- He's not into Santería?
- No.

671
00:57:20,717 --> 00:57:22,082
Did Lopez know him?

672
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:24,414
We all do. He organizes our fundraisers.

673
00:57:25,389 --> 00:57:29,758
This says there's a fundraiser this week.
Could you arrange for me to go?

674
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:32,484
Yes.

675
00:58:11,702 --> 00:58:14,671
- Dad, can we stop by the church?
- Why?

676
00:58:14,805 --> 00:58:16,796
I want to light a candle for Mom.

677
00:59:18,734 --> 00:59:20,565
<i>This is chekete.</i>

678
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,570
I'd prefer a vodka tonic.

679
00:59:22,705 --> 00:59:26,038
I'm afraid this is all we are serving.
It's traditional.

680
00:59:29,745 --> 00:59:32,407
It is also traditional to sip it slowly.

681
00:59:32,748 --> 00:59:34,409
I can see that.

682
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:37,650
Our host. Excuse me.

683
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:42,787
Robert Calder. Quite a guy.

684
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:45,893
- What do you know about him?
- Not much. Self-made man.

685
00:59:46,195 --> 00:59:48,755
He turned one midtown-building share
into a fortune.

686
00:59:49,532 --> 00:59:53,127
Now he's into everything.
Money markets, energy, the whole bit.

687
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:58,033
The person I spoke to you about
would like to meet you.

688
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,370
May I introduce Dr. Cal Jamison?

689
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:01,876
How do you do, sir.

690
01:00:01,944 --> 01:00:03,935
- My friend, Jessica Halliday.
- Hello.

691
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:05,480
Pleased to meet you.

692
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:07,448
I'm Jennifer, Mr. Calder's assistant.

693
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:09,415
Oscar's told me of your interest.

694
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:12,511
A friend told me about your organization.
I'm very impressed.

695
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:14,749
- You are the sort of man we want.
- Really?

696
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:18,153
I believe you knew my friend.
Officer Tom Lopez.

697
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:20,320
Terrible tragedy. Did you know him well?

698
01:00:20,463 --> 01:00:22,124
Not as well as I wanted to.

699
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:23,822
I suppose none of us did.

700
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:28,061
We always wish we'd known someone
better when they die unexpectedly.

701
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:30,832
I lost my only son five years ago.

702
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:34,670
Drug overdose. I live with that every day.

703
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:37,943
It tests one's faith, doesn't it?

704
01:00:38,981 --> 01:00:41,211
It can also help you find it.

705
01:00:42,518 --> 01:00:44,679
Are you a religious man?

706
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:46,686
Yes and no.

707
01:00:47,123 --> 01:00:48,784
Sign of the times.

708
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:53,351
The representative
from the mayor's office is here.

709
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,092
I hope we can work together.
It was a pleasure.

710
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:59,301
Pleasure meeting you, Mr. Calder.

711
01:00:59,368 --> 01:01:00,665
- Bob.
- Bob.

712
01:01:03,672 --> 01:01:04,502
Goodbye.

713
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:08,875
Would you like a cigar?

714
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:10,809
No, thanks. I'm trying to cut down.

715
01:01:10,946 --> 01:01:14,712
- Smoke attracts the gods.
- It makes them want to join the party.

716
01:01:15,317 --> 01:01:16,978
How about that?

717
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,481
I'm gonna go pee. I'll be right back.

718
01:01:48,517 --> 01:01:50,849
- Did they show you a warrant?
- They did.

719
01:01:51,187 --> 01:01:55,180
How could anybody think
that anybody in our organization...

720
01:01:55,524 --> 01:01:57,651
...could do something so monstrous?

721
01:01:58,694 --> 01:02:00,958
Clearly they made a mistake.

722
01:02:01,397 --> 01:02:03,797
- Let the lawyers handle it.
- I tell you...

723
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:06,662
...if all the good work we've done
is destroyed by this...

724
01:02:06,735 --> 01:02:09,397
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word on that.

725
01:02:09,872 --> 01:02:11,669
What is the detective's name?

726
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,071
McTaggert.

727
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:15,141
Lt. McTaggert.

728
01:02:15,478 --> 01:02:17,503
I don't want you to worry about this.

729
01:02:33,796 --> 01:02:37,926
<i>We are proud to present the chairman
of our board, Mr. Robert Calder.</i>

730
01:02:43,973 --> 01:02:47,841
<i>Thank you. On behalf
of the A.C.H.E. Program...</i>

731
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:54,877
<i>... I'm especially proud to say that
thanks to your generous contributions...</i>

732
01:02:54,950 --> 01:02:56,884
<i>... during our sixth year...</i>

733
01:02:56,952 --> 01:02:59,614
<i>... A.C.H.E. Program offices...</i>

734
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:03,647
<i>... will be opening in Detroit, Los Angeles,
Miami and Washington, D.C.</i>

735
01:03:06,629 --> 01:03:10,588
<i>I have a check here for $50,000.
Now, this is a personal check.</i>

736
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:12,824
<i>Don't worry, I'm good for it.</i>

737
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:16,464
<i>My challenge to you tonight...</i>

738
01:03:16,805 --> 01:03:21,139
<i>... is that collectively we top
the contributions that were made last year.</i>

739
01:03:21,477 --> 01:03:23,809
<i>Our helpers will be moving amongst you.</i>

740
01:03:24,146 --> 01:03:27,638
<i>The next hand you feel in your pocket
may not be your own.</i>

741
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:33,811
<i>We'd like to collect $425,111...</i>

742
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:35,882
<i>... from this room!</i>

743
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:38,822
<i>Now I know you're up to it.</i>

744
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:40,822
<i>I have faith!</i>

745
01:03:41,664 --> 01:03:44,997
<i>And remember, it's still tax deductible.</i>

746
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:57,506
Thank you.

747
01:04:40,656 --> 01:04:42,248
What should we do?

748
01:05:26,902 --> 01:05:29,234
Don't touch him! He's not one of us!

749
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:30,494
Go!

750
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:41,302
What the hell are you doing? Stop it!

751
01:06:41,810 --> 01:06:43,072
Get away from him!

752
01:06:46,215 --> 01:06:47,273
Get out!

753
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:49,712
Stay with him!

754
01:06:50,152 --> 01:06:52,450
I warned you about this.
You're fired! Get out!

755
01:06:52,521 --> 01:06:53,852
You don't understand!

756
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:56,082
You don't understand! You're fired!

757
01:06:56,325 --> 01:06:58,816
He's in danger! I'm trying to protect him!

758
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:01,986
The kid is hysterical! Get out!

759
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:03,728
I don't want to hear!

760
01:07:03,999 --> 01:07:06,092
Let me finish doing this!

761
01:07:06,201 --> 01:07:08,032
You are finished! Go!

762
01:07:08,103 --> 01:07:11,595
- You don't know what you're doing!
- I know exactly what I'm doing!

763
01:07:14,777 --> 01:07:17,109
My God, you're killing me!

764
01:07:18,447 --> 01:07:21,382
If I see you around here again,
I'll call the police.

765
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:23,008
Is that clear enough?

766
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:38,929
- What's the matter with you guys?
- It won't happen again.

767
01:07:39,134 --> 01:07:40,965
It happens all the time!

768
01:07:41,303 --> 01:07:44,932
Do me a favor. Keep the greens
on the desk, not in the box!

769
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:49,710
You always say, "I'm sorry"!
Get your act together!

770
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:55,776
Cal.

771
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:59,348
- How are you doing?
- Lieutenant? Is this a bad time?

772
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,912
It's always a bad time around here.

773
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:03,691
Let's go.

774
01:08:05,561 --> 01:08:07,722
- What's up?
- What's in here.

775
01:08:09,865 --> 01:08:14,029
Sezine's story on his son checks out.
Autopsy confirms the kid OD'd.

776
01:08:15,571 --> 01:08:18,540
That's what I expected.
What about the Calder boy?

777
01:08:18,674 --> 01:08:21,507
Same thing. Overdose five years ago.

778
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:30,942
Five years ago, this boy was 8 years old.
8-year-olds don't usually OD.

779
01:08:31,053 --> 01:08:34,545
- Where's the autopsy report?
- I can't find it.

780
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:36,649
Are you serious?

781
01:08:36,825 --> 01:08:38,759
Nobody knows where it is.

782
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:44,157
Are you saying you lost it,
or somebody doesn't want it found?

783
01:08:44,233 --> 01:08:45,359
Listen.

784
01:08:45,634 --> 01:08:49,229
We're dropping this investigation.
We're laying the murders on Lopez.

785
01:08:49,304 --> 01:08:52,535
Lopez didn't kill anybody but himself.
Where is this coming from?

786
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:56,135
Lopez is dead.
We got him tied to the kids.

787
01:08:56,278 --> 01:09:00,612
He took his life out of his own guilt.
We got enough to close now!

788
01:09:01,383 --> 01:09:04,216
Who the hell do you think you're kidding?

789
01:09:06,955 --> 01:09:08,252
You want...

790
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,917
...me to show you?

791
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:35,173
Come here.

792
01:09:38,954 --> 01:09:40,785
You didn't see this.

793
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:48,526
<i>Culebras.</i>

794
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:08,546
- Sorry we're late.
- No problem. We're all set.

795
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:10,712
All right. All aboard.

796
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,280
Plenty of good seats still available.
Tickets please.

797
01:10:15,357 --> 01:10:17,348
I have my ticket.

798
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:20,987
Now listen, be a good boy.

799
01:10:21,063 --> 01:10:25,159
I'll be out in a couple of days and we'll
go to Santa Fe to see your grandparents.

800
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:27,428
- I'm going to go sailing.
- Sailing?

801
01:10:27,502 --> 01:10:30,767
I fully expect you to be captain of the ship,
Mr. Christopher.

802
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:33,774
I'll call tomorrow
and you'll tell me all about it.

803
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:35,633
I love you, Dad.

804
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:38,172
I love you, too.

805
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:43,048
Have a great time, kiddo.

806
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:03,402
- All ashore that's going ashore.
- Come along, matey, here we go!

807
01:11:03,772 --> 01:11:05,137
Watch your feet.

808
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:07,471
- Don't worry about anything.
- Thanks.

809
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:11,205
See you both Friday.
I have a glorious dinner planned.

810
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:12,871
- See you.
- Bye, Dad.

811
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,931
Why would my housekeeper
take it from my son? Is it Santería?

812
01:11:39,441 --> 01:11:41,534
No, this is not Santería.

813
01:11:42,310 --> 01:11:44,369
<i>It is black magic. Brujería.</i>

814
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:48,414
This symbol belongs to a god
of destruction and pestilence...

815
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:50,311
<i>...El engaסador, the trickster.</i>

816
01:11:50,385 --> 01:11:52,876
What does it have to do with my son?

817
01:11:52,954 --> 01:11:54,285
There was...

818
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:56,187
...a ritual...

819
01:11:56,491 --> 01:12:00,951
...when a tribe was threatened by drought,
flood or destruction by its enemies.

820
01:12:01,496 --> 01:12:04,158
Three children were offered to the god.

821
01:12:04,232 --> 01:12:05,324
Sacrificed?

822
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,096
Elder sons sacrificed by their fathers.

823
01:12:08,170 --> 01:12:10,195
- The last child, at summer solstice.
- Why?

824
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:13,035
To gain power, to destroy their enemies.

825
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:16,702
I've seen the bodies of two children.
This ritual is being performed now.

826
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,078
Was Carmen involved?

827
01:12:19,214 --> 01:12:23,810
No, I believe she tried to cast a spell
of protection. She was not strong enough.

828
01:12:23,885 --> 01:12:25,216
It was turned against her.

829
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,685
Protection from what?

830
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,620
You both felt the power of the man
who killed Tom Lopez...

831
01:12:30,692 --> 01:12:32,956
...and those two children. I'm sure of it.

832
01:12:33,061 --> 01:12:35,222
You looked into his eyes.

833
01:12:36,998 --> 01:12:39,262
Did Calder bring that man here?

834
01:12:39,868 --> 01:12:42,769
I believe that's what Lopez
was trying to tell you.

835
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:45,603
What can I do? Please, tell me.

836
01:12:46,041 --> 01:12:50,375
The summer solstice is on June 21st.
Four days away.

837
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:53,474
You must seek protection for your son...

838
01:12:53,782 --> 01:12:55,579
...and for yourself.

839
01:12:57,319 --> 01:12:59,844
<i>I'd need a priest, a Santero.</i>

840
01:13:01,556 --> 01:13:03,217
<i>I am a Santero.</i>

841
01:13:04,192 --> 01:13:07,184
You must trust me and do as I say.

842
01:13:13,535 --> 01:13:16,265
- We shouldn't be doing this.
- You don't have to stay.

843
01:13:18,406 --> 01:13:21,102
- I think we should both leave, right now.
- No.

844
01:13:21,843 --> 01:13:23,674
This doesn't feel right.

845
01:13:33,588 --> 01:13:36,580
- Cal, please!
- I don't know what else to do.

846
01:13:49,204 --> 01:13:50,694
Please kneel.

847
01:14:43,024 --> 01:14:45,015
Water to purify.

848
01:14:47,896 --> 01:14:50,694
May your enemies never see
what we are doing here.

849
01:15:03,411 --> 01:15:04,776
Stand up.

850
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:47,581
Offer the blood for your son's life.

851
01:16:16,384 --> 01:16:17,874
- Here's one.
- Another one?

852
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:21,147
This kid runs home from school
with a brown package under his arm.

853
01:16:21,222 --> 01:16:23,315
He says, "Mom, look what I found..."

854
01:16:23,391 --> 01:16:24,949
Hold on a second.

855
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,819
Detective Connolly. 2-7 squad.

856
01:16:27,896 --> 01:16:30,729
<i>This is Dr. Jamison. Lt. Mc Taggert, please.</i>

857
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:33,768
Sorry, Doctor. He's out sick.
The flu's making its rounds.

858
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:35,697
I'll call his home. Thanks.

859
01:17:02,197 --> 01:17:03,687
Why don't you come with us?

860
01:17:03,832 --> 01:17:04,821
I am.

861
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:07,267
I mean to Santa Fe, too.

862
01:17:08,336 --> 01:17:10,236
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

863
01:17:11,706 --> 01:17:13,799
This could get serious, you know?

864
01:17:14,309 --> 01:17:15,640
I hope so.

865
01:18:13,868 --> 01:18:15,392
<i>- Hello?
- It's Cal.</i>

866
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:18,234
<i>- Darling, how are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?</i>

867
01:18:18,339 --> 01:18:20,034
<i>- Just great.
- How's the weather?</i>

868
01:18:20,141 --> 01:18:22,507
It's fabulous,
and the forecast is even better.

869
01:18:22,577 --> 01:18:24,636
<i>Great. Is Chris behaving himself?</i>

870
01:18:24,879 --> 01:18:29,111
He's a delight. I'd forgotten about
8-year-olds. He's run me half ragged.

871
01:18:29,184 --> 01:18:31,982
<i>I know. I guess I'm used to it.
Can I talk to him?</i>

872
01:18:32,153 --> 01:18:35,486
He's out in the boat with Dennis right now.

873
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:38,556
<i>- I'll give him a big hug.
- Please do that for me.</i>

874
01:18:38,893 --> 01:18:41,259
<i>- Will we see you here this evening?
- Of course.</i>

875
01:18:41,329 --> 01:18:44,196
That's wonderful.
We have the whole weekend planned.

876
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:47,835
<i>- We're looking forward to it.
- All right. See you later, dear.</i>

877
01:18:47,902 --> 01:18:49,927
<i>- See you later.
- Drive carefully.</i>

878
01:18:50,004 --> 01:18:51,528
<i>- We will.
- Kisses.</i>

879
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:53,668
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

880
01:19:03,418 --> 01:19:04,749
You all right?

881
01:19:04,819 --> 01:19:07,811
<i>I'm okay, just really tired.</i>

882
01:19:08,323 --> 01:19:10,382
You don't sound okay. I'm coming over.

883
01:19:10,825 --> 01:19:15,023
No. Really.
I just think I need some more sleep.

884
01:19:15,263 --> 01:19:18,426
<i>I can call Kate and Dennis
and say we'll be out in the morning.</i>

885
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,932
<i>- No, go ahead.
- You sure?</i>

886
01:19:21,002 --> 01:19:23,436
Yes. Call me when you get there.

887
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:26,336
Give Chris my love.

888
01:19:26,941 --> 01:19:29,239
<i>Okay, I will. Take care.</i>

889
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:31,703
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

890
01:19:35,116 --> 01:19:36,515
Cal?

891
01:19:49,097 --> 01:19:50,496
Shit.

892
01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:58,803
<i>No one's here right now,
but if you leave your name and...</i>

893
01:19:59,040 --> 01:20:00,337
Hello.

894
01:20:01,242 --> 01:20:03,574
<i>- Who is this?
- It's Mc Taggert.</i>

895
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:06,443
<i>- Lieutenant.
- My apartment. Got to see you.</i>

896
01:20:06,514 --> 01:20:09,711
<i>- What's wrong?
- Just get over here! Do it!</i>

897
01:20:09,784 --> 01:20:11,217
Wait a second.

898
01:20:47,522 --> 01:20:48,955
McTaggert?

899
01:20:59,934 --> 01:21:01,458
Who is it?

900
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:03,029
It's me, Cal.

901
01:21:04,339 --> 01:21:05,567
Shut the door.

902
01:21:18,186 --> 01:21:20,746
Step into the light.
I want to see your face.

903
01:21:28,963 --> 01:21:31,329
What's going on? You don't need the gun.

904
01:21:31,633 --> 01:21:33,157
Like hell I don't.

905
01:21:33,534 --> 01:21:36,162
I saw them. They're out there.

906
01:21:36,337 --> 01:21:38,271
There's nobody out there.

907
01:21:38,539 --> 01:21:40,598
You goddamn liar!

908
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:43,339
No, Sean, I swear to you.

909
01:21:43,978 --> 01:21:46,139
I came alone. I'm here to help you.

910
01:21:48,716 --> 01:21:50,047
Open that.

911
01:21:59,661 --> 01:22:00,992
What is it?

912
01:22:01,262 --> 01:22:02,820
Calder's son.

913
01:22:03,364 --> 01:22:06,731
It wasn't an overdose.
He killed his own fucking son.

914
01:22:10,672 --> 01:22:12,401
Where did you get this?

915
01:22:12,473 --> 01:22:13,838
Buried files.

916
01:22:14,175 --> 01:22:17,406
They didn't think I knew
where to find them, but I did.

917
01:22:17,745 --> 01:22:20,009
They're out there now, watching.

918
01:22:25,219 --> 01:22:26,379
Go on.

919
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:29,581
You answer it.

920
01:22:40,568 --> 01:22:41,557
Hello.

921
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:46,103
See? You believe me now?

922
01:22:48,743 --> 01:22:50,802
Why haven't they done anything to you?

923
01:22:53,081 --> 01:22:55,072
What have they done to you?

924
01:22:58,219 --> 01:22:59,709
I can't move.

925
01:23:16,337 --> 01:23:19,170
"My God, I am heartily sorry...

926
01:23:19,507 --> 01:23:21,475
"...for having offended Thee.

927
01:23:22,577 --> 01:23:24,169
"And I detest...

928
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:26,306
"...all my sins...

929
01:23:26,581 --> 01:23:29,209
"...because of Thy just punishments.

930
01:23:29,984 --> 01:23:34,114
"But most of all because they offend Thee,
my God...

931
01:23:34,188 --> 01:23:39,182
"...who art all good,
and worthy of all my love.

932
01:23:40,194 --> 01:23:42,321
"I firmly resolve..."

933
01:23:45,733 --> 01:23:48,167
Everything's going to be all right now.

934
01:23:51,272 --> 01:23:52,762
Take the gun.

935
01:23:53,141 --> 01:23:54,506
Kill him.

936
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,301
The police won't help you.

937
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,645
He'll get to anybody.

938
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,918
Do it yourself, please, I'm begging you.

939
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:06,976
Go.

940
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:08,410
Okay.

941
01:24:16,831 --> 01:24:18,822
Destroy Calder.

942
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:21,962
God help you.

943
01:24:42,056 --> 01:24:43,956
"I firmly resolve...

944
01:24:44,025 --> 01:24:47,426
"...with the help of Thy grace,
to sin no more."

945
01:26:41,342 --> 01:26:42,570
<i>Yeah, hello.</i>

946
01:26:42,643 --> 01:26:46,511
Marty, I've got something important
I want you to keep for me.

947
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:48,547
<i>Sure. You okay?</i>

948
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:52,681
Jessica!

949
01:26:52,753 --> 01:26:54,414
I'll call you right back!

950
01:27:23,417 --> 01:27:26,614
- Vital signs?
- BP: 80 over 60. Pulse: 140.

951
01:27:26,687 --> 01:27:28,655
Respiration: 30 and shallow.

952
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:31,385
Wait outside, please.

953
01:27:46,907 --> 01:27:48,841
<i>There's no one here to take your call.</i>

954
01:27:48,909 --> 01:27:51,878
<i>But if you leave your name and number,
I'll get back to you.</i>

955
01:27:51,946 --> 01:27:53,777
<i>Please speak after the beep.</i>

956
01:27:55,049 --> 01:27:56,676
<i>It's Kate.</i>

957
01:27:56,784 --> 01:27:59,378
<i>If you hear this, do not call me.</i>

958
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,620
<i>Change of plans.</i>

959
01:28:02,957 --> 01:28:05,118
Please, God, what have I done?

960
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:07,752
Cal, I'm bringing Chris.

961
01:28:08,796 --> 01:28:10,855
Will explain all when I see you.

962
01:28:11,265 --> 01:28:13,790
Meet me, Flanders Inn...

963
01:28:14,869 --> 01:28:16,131
Hello?

964
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,912
<i>Marty, make sure they take care of her
till I get back.</i>

965
01:28:29,984 --> 01:28:31,713
<i>I will! She's covered.</i>

966
01:28:31,886 --> 01:28:35,788
<i>I told everyone at the hospital
I'm a lawyer. They're not idiots. Relax.</i>

967
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:40,654
Get some sleep.

968
01:29:17,064 --> 01:29:19,464
- Can you find your way back?
- No problem.

969
01:29:29,477 --> 01:29:31,138
Keep this for me.

970
01:29:32,046 --> 01:29:34,606
Thanks for everything. I'll see you.

971
01:29:41,088 --> 01:29:42,919
The prodigal son returns!

972
01:29:42,990 --> 01:29:46,050
- Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
- Not a word of it. Come in.

973
01:29:46,127 --> 01:29:50,461
Kate's gone to her all-night market.
She never thinks we have enough food.

974
01:30:12,786 --> 01:30:14,777
- Last door on the end.
- Okay.

975
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,382
- Thank you, Dennis.
- Not at all.

976
01:30:50,090 --> 01:30:53,150
- Hell of a week for you.
- A hell of a year.

977
01:30:53,727 --> 01:30:56,218
That's true. It is hell, isn't it?

978
01:30:56,764 --> 01:30:58,561
There's no point in denying it.

979
01:30:58,799 --> 01:31:02,235
The kind of loss you suffered,
the grief, it's dreadful.

980
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:07,268
But what can you do? Be a man about it.
That's what you've done.

981
01:31:07,608 --> 01:31:09,235
You just go on!

982
01:31:09,843 --> 01:31:11,834
And then one day...

983
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:15,277
...you wake up
and it's just the slightest bit better.

984
01:31:16,150 --> 01:31:19,017
That's the way it changes, little by little...

985
01:31:19,253 --> 01:31:21,016
...small increments.

986
01:31:21,822 --> 01:31:23,687
That's the way it was with us.

987
01:31:23,757 --> 01:31:26,351
We thought we'd never get over it.
But you do.

988
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:27,820
When was that?

989
01:31:28,362 --> 01:31:31,456
Kate's fieldwork. Post-graduate.
Summer of '46.

990
01:31:31,999 --> 01:31:34,661
The Sudan. 11 months in the bush.

991
01:31:35,502 --> 01:31:37,493
Haven't I ever told you this story?

992
01:31:38,339 --> 01:31:39,328
No.

993
01:31:40,874 --> 01:31:42,842
Worst drought in 50 years.

994
01:31:43,143 --> 01:31:44,508
Then cholera.

995
01:31:44,712 --> 01:31:47,272
We saw half the tribe decimated.

996
01:31:48,649 --> 01:31:50,617
Daniel was only 4 years old.

997
01:31:50,884 --> 01:31:54,149
I'd argued against bringing him,
but Kate insisted.

998
01:31:54,455 --> 01:31:57,049
She couldn't bear to leave him that long.

999
01:31:57,758 --> 01:31:59,817
Then, when Daniel took sick...

1000
01:32:00,094 --> 01:32:02,392
...the elders of the tribe came to see us.

1001
01:32:02,463 --> 01:32:05,899
We'd developed a trust with them by then.
A bond.

1002
01:32:06,767 --> 01:32:11,033
What they suggested seemed unthinkable,
against nature.

1003
01:32:11,405 --> 01:32:12,895
But you see...

1004
01:32:13,841 --> 01:32:15,103
...Daniel...

1005
01:32:15,976 --> 01:32:19,173
...was so clearly beyond any medical help...

1006
01:32:20,648 --> 01:32:23,208
...and as outsiders, it was a great honor.

1007
01:32:24,618 --> 01:32:26,449
Daniel was very brave.

1008
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,951
And the drought did end.
We were delivered.

1009
01:32:31,125 --> 01:32:33,320
The life of another child was saved.

1010
01:32:34,094 --> 01:32:36,619
A most remarkable child.

1011
01:32:37,765 --> 01:32:41,633
Over the years, he's grown so special
to us, almost like a son.

1012
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:44,266
He's taught us so much.

1013
01:32:49,777 --> 01:32:54,714
Of course, you're uncertain, naturally.
So was I until I met him.

1014
01:32:55,649 --> 01:32:57,310
Now imagine, if you can...

1015
01:32:58,152 --> 01:33:00,120
...a life without uncertainty.

1016
01:33:00,354 --> 01:33:03,482
Freedom from doubt.
The ability to choose.

1017
01:33:03,924 --> 01:33:05,516
Single-mindedness.

1018
01:33:05,859 --> 01:33:08,760
One life from each of us is all he asks.

1019
01:33:08,962 --> 01:33:12,022
He rewards our devotion a thousandfold.

1020
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:15,598
Personal desires?
Yes, of course. Anything.

1021
01:33:15,969 --> 01:33:18,460
- That's part of it.
- It's only the beginning.

1022
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,508
There was a time when man was at one
with the gods, before the Fall.

1023
01:33:24,144 --> 01:33:28,308
Now we're at one again
and their benediction is power.

1024
01:33:29,149 --> 01:33:31,640
It's a power you can't imagine.

1025
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:35,488
Power to create a world of our choosing.

1026
01:33:36,757 --> 01:33:39,317
Power to destroy those who oppose us.

1027
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,050
Chris was chosen.

1028
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:45,162
When he found the shell, remember?
It was a sign.

1029
01:33:49,403 --> 01:33:51,132
We want you to join us!

1030
01:35:27,801 --> 01:35:29,462
It must be the father.

1031
01:37:13,607 --> 01:37:15,700
"We consecrate this ground...

1032
01:37:16,543 --> 01:37:18,670
"...with this father's humble offering.

1033
01:37:19,546 --> 01:37:21,741
"We seek the strength and wisdom...

1034
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:24,016
"...of our benefactors.

1035
01:37:24,484 --> 01:37:27,351
"We call upon the ancient gods
to renew our strength.

1036
01:37:28,355 --> 01:37:32,155
"Guide your hand to strike down
the enemies of our faith and this nation.

1037
01:37:32,292 --> 01:37:34,783
"We welcome our brother, Cal...

1038
01:37:35,596 --> 01:37:37,928
"...reborn into your grace.

1039
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,261
"Restore nature's order.

1040
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:48,203
"The power, which is our birthright.

1041
01:37:49,443 --> 01:37:52,105
"The glory, which is our destiny.

1042
01:37:54,114 --> 01:37:58,107
"Our enemies consumed by rings of fire.

1043
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:02,619
"Our strength reborn...

1044
01:38:02,956 --> 01:38:04,287
"...in sacrifice!"

1045
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:42,184
Do you believe?

1046
01:39:47,861 --> 01:39:50,421
Yes, I do believe.

1047
01:40:17,591 --> 01:40:18,785
Dad?

1048
01:40:21,027 --> 01:40:24,724
"Peter, Peter, pumpkin eater
Had a wife and couldn't keep her..."

1049
01:40:24,798 --> 01:40:27,289
- You okay?
- I'm all right! Where is he?

1050
01:40:27,367 --> 01:40:30,268
Fucking maniacs! Who are these guys?

1051
01:40:30,904 --> 01:40:33,464
They jumped in the elevator.
They took him up.

1052
01:40:35,876 --> 01:40:37,503
I'll take this one.

1053
01:40:46,052 --> 01:40:47,041
Dad!

1054
01:40:55,395 --> 01:40:56,726
Let me go!

1055
01:40:58,431 --> 01:40:59,989
Goddamn.

1056
01:42:05,065 --> 01:42:06,965
God gave His only begotten son.

1057
01:42:07,067 --> 01:42:08,466
Let him go!

1058
01:42:09,169 --> 01:42:10,693
Remember that?

1059
01:42:11,204 --> 01:42:13,798
It is God's will
that innocence redeem the world.

1060
01:42:14,374 --> 01:42:16,968
We give our sons to war
in the name of peace!

1061
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:21,742
Sacrifice our families to false gods,
ambition, lust, pride!

1062
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:24,883
It's hypocrisy! This is all lies.

1063
01:42:25,352 --> 01:42:29,686
I was a slave, I had no life!
You have no life! God gives you life!

1064
01:42:30,323 --> 01:42:32,154
You give them innocence...

1065
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:34,884
...the gods give you life.

1066
01:42:35,929 --> 01:42:38,363
And your son was innocent, wasn't he?

1067
01:42:39,132 --> 01:42:41,794
Peter, that was your son's name, wasn't it?

1068
01:42:44,237 --> 01:42:47,229
And you sacrificed your son
to the gods, didn't you?

1069
01:42:50,577 --> 01:42:52,568
That was my salvation.

1070
01:42:53,446 --> 01:42:54,936
I was reborn.

1071
01:42:55,715 --> 01:42:59,549
It must have taken great strength
and great courage.

1072
01:43:00,820 --> 01:43:01,980
Tell me.

1073
01:43:05,592 --> 01:43:07,082
He looked into my eyes.

1074
01:43:11,364 --> 01:43:13,025
He forgave me...

1075
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:14,923
...Peter.

1076
01:43:18,138 --> 01:43:19,628
He understood.

1077
01:44:59,572 --> 01:45:01,062
I'm over here.

1078
01:45:01,808 --> 01:45:02,797
Come to me.

1079
01:45:04,377 --> 01:45:05,366
No.

1080
01:45:07,747 --> 01:45:09,578
You come to me.

1081
01:46:29,195 --> 01:46:30,492
Let's go, boy.

1082
01:46:36,736 --> 01:46:38,226
Hey Bean, how's it going?

1083
01:46:38,338 --> 01:46:41,136
- Hey, Dad. Got the barbecue sauce?
- Sure do.

1084
01:46:41,274 --> 01:46:43,265
Let's go easy on it this time.

1085
01:46:44,611 --> 01:46:46,704
Don't you look beautiful.

1086
01:46:48,248 --> 01:46:50,011
- I'm glad you're home.
- Me, too.

1087
01:46:50,083 --> 01:46:52,745
- Be careful with that, Chris.
- All right, Mom.

1088
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:14,802
It'll keep.

1089
01:47:18,645 --> 01:47:20,203
Maybe it won't!

1090
01:47:25,618 --> 01:47:28,610
Chris, that looks terrific.
You don't need my help at all.

1091
01:47:51,044 --> 01:47:52,477
What is it, boy?

1092
01:47:53,079 --> 01:47:54,410
Easy!

1093
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:19,231
What's wrong, boy?

1094
01:48:21,007 --> 01:48:22,565
Anybody up there?

1095
01:48:23,710 --> 01:48:25,143
All right, out!

1096
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:08,212
I did it for us.

1097
01:49:12,892 --> 01:49:14,723
We'll be safe now.
