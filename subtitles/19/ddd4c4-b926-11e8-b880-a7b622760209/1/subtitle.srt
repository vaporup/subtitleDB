1
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:18,790
Watch out for the devil!

2
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:23,627
Yin!

3
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:26,863
Yin!

4
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:36,110
Prajna paramita!

5
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:41,418
She is here!

6
00:00:47,092 --> 00:00:49,219
I'll take care of her, come on

7
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,061
Watch out!

8
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:54,087
I saw it

9
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,705
This Tree Devil is very powerful

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
Now its energy is gone!

11
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,269
Let me freeze it
with the power from my palm

12
00:01:39,311 --> 00:01:41,745
But it will resurrect
in a hundred year's time

13
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:44,415
Hocus pocus!

14
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:46,278
Prajna paramita!

15
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,496
Master,
we've finally found Kwan Bo County...

16
00:03:46,538 --> 00:03:48,665
It's just over...

17
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,870
There?
Over there?

18
00:03:52,911 --> 00:03:54,536
Look at your map

19
00:03:56,248 --> 00:03:58,375
Hey... it's flown away

20
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,451
Where's it gone?

21
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:10,357
We'll get to Kwan Bo County
if we head west

22
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:12,360
Master

23
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:16,035
There's rain clouds coming,
let's find shelter

24
00:04:16,035 --> 00:04:16,809
Alright

25
00:04:16,809 --> 00:04:18,634
Let's go...

26
00:04:19,705 --> 00:04:22,196
There's a place to hide

27
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:33,019
Buddha,
please make the rain go...

28
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:35,749
so we can get on our way

29
00:04:43,896 --> 00:04:47,059
Master, I'm not thirsty,
you drink it

30
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:13,554
It's bad luck!

31
00:05:14,993 --> 00:05:16,426
Go!

32
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:21,057
Gentlemen!

33
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:24,635
I didn't even recognize the skull

34
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,404
Give me my money back!

35
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:39,078
He's a master swordsman!

36
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,551
The man with the money
should go on ahead!

37
00:05:40,586 --> 00:05:42,349
Run, run!

38
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:11,375
It's a tragedy, tragedy!

39
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,407
Master,
there's a killer outside, he's...

40
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,350
...here?

41
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,717
Thank god I got my money back,
I've been saving!

42
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:18,348
If those thieves took it...

43
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,757
It's a bit cold, isn't it?

44
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:26,060
Money is illusion,
why kill for it?

45
00:06:26,098 --> 00:06:29,226
Be merciful,
or you will pay for your deeds

46
00:06:29,268 --> 00:06:31,361
Merciful?
You don't have to make a living...

47
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,894
I worked hard for this money!

48
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:38,040
You want to fight?

49
00:06:38,076 --> 00:06:39,304
Master!

50
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,742
It's only a hoe...

51
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,840
Fong,
dust to dust, ashes to ashes...

52
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:51,051
Go and bury the bodies

53
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:55,955
This guy's really shifty.
The gold...

54
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:57,518
Stop talking and start working

55
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,828
I'm soaked!
Don't mind if I light a fire?

56
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:07,735
Master, the bodies are in pieces...

57
00:07:07,786 --> 00:07:10,539
So I bury hands with hands,
and legs with legs?

58
00:07:11,276 --> 00:07:13,939
No, be sure to bury whole corpses

59
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,146
I'm not sure that's possible

60
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:21,983
Alcohol keeps out the cold.
Want some?

61
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:24,145
Let's all get warmer...

62
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:28,014
You stupid fool!

63
00:07:30,028 --> 00:07:33,122
Fire! Fire!

64
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:34,834
Master,
is this how you punish him?

65
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,601
Rubbish,
I'm not an arsonist!

66
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,270
I'm sorry,
we all make mistakes...

67
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,675
I've made you lose your shelter...

68
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:41,840
The market is just ahead!
We're all wanderers...

69
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,206
We don't bear grudges.
See you later

70
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,737
I've put the bodies back together again...

71
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:49,407
But there's one finger left

72
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:51,473
With my expertise,
I don't bother with fingers...

73
00:07:51,517 --> 00:07:53,917
Maybe someone else did it

74
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:56,352
Are there other chopped up bodies?

75
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,754
This is common fighting ground,
may die...

76
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,224
Enjoy putting them back together

77
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,418
Oh! It's getting dark

78
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:07,191
Ghost Festival sword and weapons for sale

79
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,432
Help! Murder!

80
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:12,430
You hit me! Stay there!

81
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:14,268
This sword is the latest style!

82
00:08:14,306 --> 00:08:16,570
Do you think I'm buying jewelry?

83
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,166
Who hit me?
Show yourself and fight!

84
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,075
Who hit someone?

85
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:21,704
What's happening?

86
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,910
Make way!
Police passing through, make way!

87
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,475
Police passing, make way!

88
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,155
What's going on here?

89
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:31,156
I don't know

90
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:32,380
Forget it then

91
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,221
Hey, stop staring at me!

92
00:08:34,259 --> 00:08:35,817
It's nothing, nothing's wrong!

93
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:38,856
Come look at our swords, sir

94
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,809
It's Ghost Festival!

95
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,848
The human race has stooped to new lows...

96
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:45,604
How can we Buddhists redeem their souls?

97
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:47,865
I really don't know

98
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,704
With my wisdom, I can save them...

99
00:08:50,742 --> 00:08:53,370
But my body's feeling very weak...

100
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:56,843
Let's find an inn,
get some food and sleep

101
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:59,844
Buddha meditated facing
a wall for 3 years...

102
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,978
and you complain after
no food for one day...

103
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,456
For penance, chant 5,000 times,

104
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,457
to purity the mind...

105
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:09,756
Right! Look, food, let's eat,
then purity my mind

106
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,059
His brain's in his stomach!

107
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:16,862
That cretin,
I'll kill him for 15 dollars

108
00:09:17,335 --> 00:09:19,700
It was only 10 dollars last time,
why more?

109
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,675
Because I'm a better swordsman now

110
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:24,477
So you say-but how good?

111
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:25,611
Beef brisket and noodles!

112
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:27,642
Hey, I never ordered that

113
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:29,476
Are you saying I made a mistake?

114
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:31,448
Orders returned are charged double!

115
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,949
- What do you want?
- I told you I didn't order it!

116
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,652
More of them than us,
okay, take it away...

117
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:39,153
It's just a misunderstanding

118
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:41,792
As I improve,
my price will rise again...

119
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,385
If you don't like it,
find someone else

120
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:45,592
For that price,
I need some sort of sample

121
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,064
- You want me to show off? No problem!
- You want to see sample?

122
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,243
Sir, spare us some food?
I bet you my head

123
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,578
No, get lost!

124
00:09:58,578 --> 00:09:59,911
Fong

125
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:03,848
My sword's a bit long, I'm sorry!

126
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,443
We shouldn't stay here, let's go!

127
00:10:08,186 --> 00:10:10,054
Every time I see you there's trouble

128
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,179
Brother

129
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,963
and more trouble now

130
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:18,860
with that lump of gold!

131
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,568
Master, there's shelter ahead

132
00:10:31,576 --> 00:10:33,467
It's a Temple

133
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:36,207
Orchid Temple

134
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:41,986
The entrance is over there

135
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,215
They've gone inside...

136
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,694
But Orchid Temple's haunted,
wait till dawn

137
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:51,755
Yes, let's wait!

138
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:53,899
Dawn?
What if someone else gets it?

139
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:55,333
Hey, you lead!

140
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,600
Me?

141
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:09,741
A ghost got my foot, run!

142
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,180
Run!

143
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:28,494
It's a bit draughty in here, Master

144
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:30,330
Don't be afraid, let me tell you...

145
00:11:30,769 --> 00:11:32,537
Orchid Temple is haunted

146
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,871
What?
Haunted...

147
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,874
Master, Master!

148
00:11:39,911 --> 00:11:42,905
Fong, stop stepping on my heels

149
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:45,576
I just want you to know I'm behind you

150
00:11:45,617 --> 00:11:48,211
If you're so scared,
sleep outside the door

151
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:50,050
It's pouring outside

152
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,766
Master,
if it's really haunted...

153
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,842
I don't mind if we carry on walking

154
00:12:03,842 --> 00:12:07,071
Fong, we have Gold Buddha to protect us...

155
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:09,499
No one will dare come in...

156
00:12:09,741 --> 00:12:11,800
So we won't have to worry
about it being stolen...

157
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:13,806
We'll just stay overnight

158
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:19,282
Shall we satisfy the God of Hunger?

159
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:22,649
You beg the ghosts
to spare you some food

160
00:12:23,859 --> 00:12:26,992
Funny,
I've forgotten what I've just said!

161
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:34,325
Who said a ghost got his foot?
Was it you?

162
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:36,735
- No
- Was it you?

163
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,740
- No
- He did!

164
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,838
If it got you,
how come you could run so fast?

165
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,432
There's a woman singing, up there

166
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,544
Sister,
it's raining so hard outside...

167
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:56,809
I wonder how long
before they come inside

168
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:04,417
We're here!

169
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:11,193
So many men!

170
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,665
Women! They're beautiful!

171
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,893
Smells so good

172
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:25,839
Don't go, so beautiful!

173
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:29,780
Come on

174
00:14:58,843 --> 00:15:00,210
There are more!

175
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:02,040
They're so ugly!

176
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:12,049
The one in the middle's the prettiest

177
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,861
She's so old!

178
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:18,796
The one next to her's beautiful

179
00:15:24,803 --> 00:15:29,172
Priestress, there are so many,
I'll help Lotus

180
00:15:29,207 --> 00:15:31,801
Alright,
that way I won't have to wait so long

181
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:48,421
These men're already trapped,
who needs your help?

182
00:15:48,727 --> 00:15:52,258
I thought you'd be quicker,
it took you ages

183
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:55,295
They're already ours,
so what's the rush?

184
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:59,267
Take your clothes off, she's coming.
I'm taking the prettiest one. Hands off!

185
00:16:01,272 --> 00:16:03,604
Your skin's so soft.
Give me a kiss!

186
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,705
Go to hell

187
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:13,506
There're all kinds of games,
want to try?

188
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,678
Something in the water bit me,
what is it?

189
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,942
What is it? Let's go!

190
00:16:58,763 --> 00:17:00,560
What's happening?
Let's go, they're demons

191
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,205
What's that sound, Master?

192
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:16,736
The ghosts are out

193
00:17:19,317 --> 00:17:20,578
What shall I do?
Master!

194
00:17:20,618 --> 00:17:22,108
Watch the Gold Buddha,
and stay put...

195
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,381
I'm going to catch the demons!

196
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,928
Don't come near me,
I have a Gold Buddha

197
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:47,808
You're powerful,
you hide even from me!

198
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:55,146
Show your true selves!
Stars scatter!

199
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:20,278
Still able to hide,
it's powerful!

200
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,744
Priestess, what about that monk?

201
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:29,218
Don't worry!

202
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:33,691
He maybe powerful,
but he's no match for me

203
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:41,461
We'll play with them awhile.
You seduce the little monk

204
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,961
Priestess, let me go,
I can handle him

205
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:54,011
You're not experienced enough,
when it comes to men

206
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:57,009
Priestess, I know exactly what you mean...

207
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:59,541
You don't want her wasting your time

208
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,986
Let me bring him back to you quickly

209
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:23,037
Sorry,
I forgot your cover was damaged...

210
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,065
You got all wet

211
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,543
I'll say some prayers as penance later

212
00:19:35,286 --> 00:19:37,045
I know you have great powers...

213
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:39,420
If we really meet a - ghost...

214
00:19:39,537 --> 00:19:43,894
Please help me destroy whatever it is

215
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:02,846
Buddha!

216
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:04,375
Oh no!

217
00:20:05,016 --> 00:20:07,849
Help, there's a ghost!

218
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:10,718
A ghost chasing her?
That means she's not a ghost

219
00:20:11,355 --> 00:20:13,622
Help!

220
00:20:13,658 --> 00:20:15,148
Ghost!

221
00:20:15,827 --> 00:20:17,294
Lady!

222
00:20:19,897 --> 00:20:21,057
Lady!

223
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,659
There's a ghost! Ghosts!

224
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:29,332
I'm so afraid!

225
00:20:34,278 --> 00:20:37,442
I'm so scared, please help me!

226
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:43,752
I can see flesh!
Where is the ghost?

227
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,851
Let me hide behind you!

228
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:50,328
Look,
there's something moving over there...

229
00:20:50,328 --> 00:20:52,760
Hold me tight!

230
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:55,224
Your leg

231
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:58,002
Feel my heart,
it's beating so rapidly!

232
00:20:58,002 --> 00:20:59,530
Come on!

233
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:04,210
I break my vows,
if I'm near a woman!

234
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,341
Let's pray together,
it'll keep the ghosts away

235
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,819
Don't pray now,
let's do something else!

236
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,017
Let me go, or I'll break my vows!

237
00:21:17,055 --> 00:21:19,621
Did you know, you're my first man?

238
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,321
Let me help you undress

239
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,525
What? Undress?

240
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,704
Hey wait, my shoe!

241
00:21:25,704 --> 00:21:26,959
If Master sees me like this...

242
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,767
he'll never believe I was saving your life!

243
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:30,457
No! I must pray

244
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:34,236
Where're my prayer books?
Where're my prayer books?

245
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,478
Fire! Come and save me!

246
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,152
How did it catch fire?

247
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:46,446
My clothes are on fire!

248
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,749
Take your clothes off!

249
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:53,885
Fire, help!

250
00:21:55,927 --> 00:21:57,106
Stop undressing,
they're not burning now!

251
00:21:57,106 --> 00:21:59,231
I must, I'm afraid of fire!

252
00:21:59,231 --> 00:22:01,229
But I'll see everything

253
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,333
Lady

254
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,240
Hey, monk... has the fire gone out?

255
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,874
It was so dangerous!

256
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:14,204
My clothes are all burnt, what to do?

257
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,115
Cover yourself with my robe

258
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,117
You're so kind!

259
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:22,917
Put it on quickly, I won't watch

260
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:24,444
I tripped on your clothes

261
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:26,790
Stop,
or I won't be able to control myself!

262
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,656
I'm a bad girl,
are you as bad as me?

263
00:22:32,203 --> 00:22:34,031
I thought,
you were being chased by a ghost?

264
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:37,466
Ghost? Here's your ghost!
Come and get me...

265
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:41,335
This is fun!

266
00:22:41,906 --> 00:22:43,775
But it didn't last long!

267
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:57,387
Lucky I prayed in time...

268
00:22:57,422 --> 00:22:59,755
or I would've done that
"stuff" with you

269
00:23:00,432 --> 00:23:01,484
Hey, monk...

270
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,489
What would you have done?
Tell me

271
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:06,929
I said means I want...
I want means I desire...

272
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,296
I desire means I'll do...

273
00:23:08,366 --> 00:23:10,357
If I do, I'll never stay a monk!

274
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:12,266
No, I must pray

275
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:19,404
Stop praying, help me up...

276
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:21,337
Quickly!

277
00:23:21,379 --> 00:23:22,607
I'll help you up...
But you promise not to come too close...

278
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,114
Darn I saw it!

279
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:28,117
Aren't you interested in me at all?

280
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,151
Interested? In what way?

281
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:32,281
All men are interested in this!

282
00:23:32,523 --> 00:23:34,518
Don't take off my pants...

283
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,896
It's strange!
Your head aches when I pray...

284
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:47,227
You weren't being chased by a ghost!

285
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:49,965
You are a ghost!

286
00:23:56,314 --> 00:23:58,480
I'm going to get you!

287
00:24:10,661 --> 00:24:13,489
It's really haunted,
I'm scared!

288
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,729
I better run!

289
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,340
Come over here!

290
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:29,212
Reveal your true form!

291
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:31,200
You're mine

292
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,807
Reveal yourself!

293
00:25:02,443 --> 00:25:04,740
Stupid monk,
why've you stopped praying?

294
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:11,678
Go,
if Master returns you'll never escape!

295
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:14,214
Why are you letting me go?

296
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,852
I'm giving you a chance to reform...

297
00:25:16,894 --> 00:25:18,794
So you can reincarnate as a good person

298
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,128
I'm evil! I'll never change

299
00:25:21,699 --> 00:25:23,291
Hey, my robe!

300
00:25:23,334 --> 00:25:26,132
If you want it, get it yourself!

301
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,672
It serves you right!

302
00:25:33,304 --> 00:25:36,602
Help me, quick help me!

303
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,114
Go on, scram!

304
00:25:49,126 --> 00:25:51,393
Waiting for me to hit you?

305
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,735
Hey, my robe!

306
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,085
Still playing games with me!

307
00:26:15,186 --> 00:26:17,586
Master!
You appeared so suddenly!

308
00:26:17,621 --> 00:26:20,056
Fong,
what're you doing here half naked?

309
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:22,718
It's too hot,
I came outside to cool down

310
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,660
Hot? Where's the Gold Buddha?

311
00:26:24,695 --> 00:26:26,993
- It's inside, it's just fine!
- Well.

312
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,723
Did you see anything untoward?

313
00:26:30,568 --> 00:26:31,936
No way,
not with the Gold Buddha here...

314
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:33,842
No ghost would dare come near...

315
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,640
Even if it did,
it wouldn't get away!

316
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,370
And did you find anything?

317
00:26:40,477 --> 00:26:42,741
That demon is quite something

318
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,919
Anyway, we're staying only one night...

319
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:46,484
and leaving tomorrow with the Gold Buddha...

320
00:26:46,484 --> 00:26:47,769
So we'd better get some rest...

321
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,559
or we'll be tired tomorrow

322
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:51,850
Okay...

323
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,726
I'll capture them sooner or later

324
00:26:54,726 --> 00:26:58,062
Your senses are impure,
that's why you're hot...

325
00:26:58,062 --> 00:27:00,264
Take the Gold Buddha out and pray

326
00:27:00,264 --> 00:27:01,761
Take the Gold Buddha out?

327
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:06,496
Pray all night in front of it

328
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:08,022
On my own?

329
00:27:08,022 --> 00:27:09,367
Why,
you want me to keep you company?

330
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:11,504
No, no!

331
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:16,741
Okay, let's go inside!

332
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:49,842
Will you stop that.
If Master sees it, I've had it!

333
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:58,852
Fong

334
00:28:00,758 --> 00:28:02,155
Good morning Master

335
00:28:02,726 --> 00:28:05,691
Bring the Buddha, we're leaving

336
00:28:06,931 --> 00:28:08,593
Okay

337
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:10,323
Darn,
he'll find out sooner or later

338
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,769
Please help me find the Gold Buddha!

339
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:13,630
- What did you say?
- Nothing, just saying my prayers

340
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:20,737
- Fong
- Yes

341
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:22,638
I'm glad the Buddha's safe...

342
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,212
or there's no point
in going to imperial Temple

343
00:28:24,212 --> 00:28:25,049
That's right!

344
00:28:25,049 --> 00:28:28,916
Master, if we leave like this now...

345
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:30,745
it's not quite right...

346
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:32,623
Since you know Orchid Temple is haunted...

347
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:34,859
shouldn't we stay and get rid of the demons?

348
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:37,617
I remember a certain old monk...

349
00:28:37,761 --> 00:28:39,621
sort of say in some manuscript...

350
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:42,767
"If no one goes to hell,
and we don't go to hell...

351
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:45,001
who will go to hell?"

352
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:48,502
You're a monk,
and you don't know which manuscript!

353
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:50,775
I've always had a bad memory...

354
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:53,638
but leaving like this is irresponsible

355
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:57,414
You're right!
I'll stay and catch the demons...

356
00:28:57,414 --> 00:28:59,581
You take the Buddha to imperial Temple

357
00:28:59,917 --> 00:29:01,714
Right, I'll go

358
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,024
Fong, are you alright?

359
00:29:08,859 --> 00:29:12,987
Yes,
after praying all night my mind is pure...

360
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:14,869
but my stomach is even purer...

361
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,359
and now in the sun, I feel faint

362
00:29:17,932 --> 00:29:19,537
Are you saying that...

363
00:29:19,537 --> 00:29:20,800
you're sick?

364
00:29:21,705 --> 00:29:24,342
I'll be fine Master,
I'll overcome it...

365
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:25,710
I'll make it...

366
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,252
I'm getting there,
it's getting better...

367
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:30,209
No it's not working...
I'm going to faint

368
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:35,109
I think you're hungry,
I'll beg for food...

369
00:29:35,953 --> 00:29:39,354
My student does not behave like a monk

370
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,052
Buddha be merciful!

371
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:46,720
Gold Buddha,
I'd better find you today!

372
00:29:48,499 --> 00:29:51,161
Haven't slept all night,
I feel faint...

373
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:53,727
I'll find the Buddha,
and get Master to leave...

374
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:56,501
or when he's out,
she'll come for me again...

375
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,940
and it'll be another sleepless night!

376
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,547
Snake!

377
00:30:24,435 --> 00:30:25,993
What now? Oh no!

378
00:30:26,036 --> 00:30:27,901
I only have a day left...

379
00:30:28,272 --> 00:30:31,070
Buddha, have mercy, help Fong

380
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:32,234
Buddha!

381
00:30:34,211 --> 00:30:36,907
Look this blade cuts heads off
like slicing melons

382
00:30:36,947 --> 00:30:39,575
Really?
Let's try it on your head

383
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:42,085
Please be merciful,
put down your knives

384
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,655
- Get lost
- Give me something

385
00:30:44,655 --> 00:30:47,253
Shove off!

386
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:50,361
You monks,
always lecturing people...

387
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:51,606
You're ruining our business...

388
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:53,054
Get lost!

389
00:30:57,635 --> 00:30:58,970
Give me the money you owe me

390
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,834
- I don't have any money
- Give my money back!

391
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:04,402
- No money? What's all that on the ground?
- That's my money!

392
00:31:04,402 --> 00:31:05,646
It's mine now

393
00:31:05,646 --> 00:31:06,477
Since when did I owe you money?

394
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:08,146
When you asked me to do the job

395
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:09,470
What job?

396
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:11,382
I don't know you

397
00:31:11,382 --> 00:31:12,624
Exactly, he doesn't know you!

398
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:13,912
The money's mine

399
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:16,451
- I don't know him
- Go to hell

400
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:21,356
Sir,
how do you know the money's yours?

401
00:31:21,692 --> 00:31:23,956
He's right, prove it's yours,
and you can have it!

402
00:31:23,994 --> 00:31:26,121
Right, you said it,
you better mean it

403
00:31:27,831 --> 00:31:30,034
Abracadabra...

404
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:31,129
Rise...

405
00:31:35,372 --> 00:31:37,435
Money, money, are you mine?

406
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,434
Ah! It's black magic!

407
00:31:40,477 --> 00:31:42,104
Let's go!

408
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:47,640
You also follow Buddha,
you should do good...

409
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,016
not concern yourself with money

410
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:50,452
How else would you get any alms?

411
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:52,059
I wouldn't accept that sort of money

412
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:52,957
No? Then leave...

413
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,458
At least I earn my money...

414
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:56,940
You wander around begging for food...

415
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,862
You're just a beggar in disguise!

416
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,232
Money is only illusion...

417
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:08,400
You can't get what's not yours

418
00:32:09,907 --> 00:32:13,209
Monk, is this your doing?

419
00:32:13,978 --> 00:32:16,538
Mercy, Buddha is merciful

420
00:32:17,748 --> 00:32:20,241
You're a fake, monk!
Admit your pranks!

421
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,452
There must be a way to break his spell!

422
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,458
Hey, don't go! Don't go!

423
00:32:31,895 --> 00:32:34,056
My money!

424
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:40,161
Another fruitless job...

425
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,094
Damn monk!

426
00:32:45,276 --> 00:32:46,607
It's getting dark!

427
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,802
What shall I tell Master?

428
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:53,941
I'll say the snakes took it...

429
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:56,017
How could the snakes take it?

430
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,284
Right,
I'll say the ghosts took it...

431
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:02,724
The Gold Buddha repels ghosts.
Impossible!

432
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:06,458
I'll tell him the truth

433
00:33:07,231 --> 00:33:08,926
That'll be Master...

434
00:33:12,303 --> 00:33:14,294
I didn't mean it Master,
I just dropped it!

435
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:15,464
Master, actually...

436
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:16,438
It's you?

437
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,168
It's you again?

438
00:33:19,209 --> 00:33:22,838
What are you doing here?
If you don't go, how'll I make a living?

439
00:33:23,413 --> 00:33:25,843
Darn!
Let me rest for one night okay?

440
00:33:25,883 --> 00:33:28,044
The way you live,
don't you feel like a whore?

441
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:29,552
Perhaps if you were human,
making a living...

442
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:32,077
But you're a ghost,
why a slut too?

443
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:33,551
Am I a slut?

444
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,581
Anyone who strips a guy's pants off is a slut!

445
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:42,359
What are you looking for?

446
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,024
The Gold Buddha...

447
00:33:44,468 --> 00:33:46,927
- I don't know where it...
- The Gold Buddha?

448
00:33:48,308 --> 00:33:49,735
Why're you getting so close?

449
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,040
I had enough fun last night!

450
00:33:54,378 --> 00:33:55,675
It's only down there

451
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:57,381
Don't come so close to me!

452
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:58,970
You think I don't want to?

453
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,780
I can't leave till the Gold Buddha's found

454
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,617
I'll help you

455
00:34:03,654 --> 00:34:05,609
The Gold Buddha's very powerful...

456
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:06,660
Aren't you afraid?

457
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,289
There's no other way...

458
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:11,351
If you don't leave,
I'll have to move!

459
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:12,824
That's a point!

460
00:34:12,863 --> 00:34:14,763
Let's go together!

461
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:19,263
Last night you surprised me and I fell...

462
00:34:19,303 --> 00:34:22,466
I dropped the Gold Buddha somewhere here

463
00:34:23,273 --> 00:34:24,475
Don't step on my clothes...

464
00:34:24,475 --> 00:34:26,844
If they fall off,
you'll say I was stripping

465
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,712
Where is it?

466
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,450
- Snakes! I forgot to say there're snakes here
- Where?

467
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:40,388
- Over there!
- Where?

468
00:34:44,895 --> 00:34:47,758
Stop it, my head aches!

469
00:34:48,098 --> 00:34:49,818
I'm only praying very softly

470
00:34:50,033 --> 00:34:52,092
Go upstairs,
you're getting in the way...

471
00:34:52,136 --> 00:34:55,831
With you here, I'll never find it!
Go on!

472
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:56,965
You're right

473
00:34:58,509 --> 00:34:59,942
Mind the snakes

474
00:35:05,149 --> 00:35:07,709
Snakes! Lots of snakes!

475
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:17,992
The Gold Buddha!
I found it!

476
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:22,457
Where is it?

477
00:35:22,499 --> 00:35:25,400
Over there, help me, there're many snakes

478
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:32,635
I didn't tell you to kill them...

479
00:35:36,914 --> 00:35:40,145
How did this happen?
What will I say?

480
00:35:40,184 --> 00:35:41,982
How can I put it back together?

481
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:49,822
I've been bitten by a snake,
it hurts!

482
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,725
Help!

483
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:55,490
I don't want to kill you, go!

484
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:57,556
Are you alright?

485
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,728
I've been poisoned

486
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,930
What shall we do?

487
00:36:00,971 --> 00:36:03,270
Suck the venom out with your mouth...

488
00:36:04,308 --> 00:36:06,742
Please, quickly

489
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:10,711
I can feel the venom...
I feel faint

490
00:36:16,746 --> 00:36:17,886
Is that alright?

491
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:20,552
That's fine, thank you...

492
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:23,324
It's okay,
anyway your wound isn't real

493
00:36:25,729 --> 00:36:27,695
Then why did you swallow the blood?

494
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:29,059
To keep you happy

495
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:33,126
The wound isn't real,
but the venom is!

496
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,400
You're right, that means...

497
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:37,403
I'll help you suck it out

498
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:39,932
No, that means mouth to mouth

499
00:36:40,677 --> 00:36:43,242
You'll die once the venom takes effect...

500
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,502
Pretend I'm not a woman

501
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:46,307
Then who are you?

502
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,085
Pretend I'm your Master

503
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,150
He would never do this

504
00:36:50,187 --> 00:36:52,018
Pretend I'm your mother

505
00:36:54,024 --> 00:36:57,290
I've never met my mother.
Try someone I've seen

506
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:02,031
How about him?

507
00:37:05,969 --> 00:37:07,059
Him?

508
00:37:09,005 --> 00:37:10,070
Okay

509
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:15,678
Whatever

510
00:37:59,923 --> 00:38:01,015
What are you doing?

511
00:38:01,058 --> 00:38:02,548
Sucking the venom

512
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,607
What did you stick in my stomach?

513
00:38:06,607 --> 00:38:07,908
My tongue

514
00:38:07,908 --> 00:38:09,400
Why stick your tongue in my stomach?

515
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,468
To suck out the venom!

516
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,766
There's still some left in you

517
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:15,801
Really?

518
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,573
Is your heart beating rapidly?

519
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,257
Yes!

520
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:22,279
Does your whole body feel hot?

521
00:38:22,279 --> 00:38:23,140
Yes

522
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,049
Do you feel sweaty,
your head ache?

523
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:26,147
Yes

524
00:38:26,147 --> 00:38:28,502
That's the effect of the venom...

525
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:29,820
We have to carry on

526
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,821
I'd rather die

527
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:34,057
Don't die here...

528
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:37,385
or you'll become one of us

529
00:38:41,334 --> 00:38:43,198
Okay, come on

530
00:38:46,069 --> 00:38:47,534
Hang on

531
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:01,278
Are you ready?

532
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:09,519
Yes,...
why didn't you stick your tongue inside?

533
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:12,722
No! There's no venom.
I was lying

534
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:15,865
How dare you deceive an honest man...

535
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,824
It's because of you.
I dropped the Buddha...

536
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:20,461
Look how I treat you,
is this my thanks?

537
00:39:20,504 --> 00:39:22,870
I'm a monk!
I have rules to follow...

538
00:39:22,906 --> 00:39:25,432
You keep seducing me,
you're trouble!

539
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:27,951
Really?

540
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,411
From what you say,
isn't it a bore being a monk?

541
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,244
You can't do what every man wants to do...

542
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:42,017
Don't you feel deprived being a monk?

543
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:46,251
Deprived?
I never had anything to lose...

544
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,526
The priority is to fix the Buddha...

545
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,627
So when Master comes back,
we can leave

546
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,138
Don't set your clothes on fire again!

547
00:40:02,045 --> 00:40:05,978
Why're you a monk,
if it's such hard work?

548
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,553
The first person I set eyes on, was Master...

549
00:40:09,553 --> 00:40:10,838
My first clothes were monk's robes...

550
00:40:10,838 --> 00:40:12,623
What else can I be except a monk...

551
00:40:12,623 --> 00:40:14,447
Do I have a choice?

552
00:40:14,942 --> 00:40:18,858
You're grown up now,
you can choose

553
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,633
I've been with Master for years,
he's family...

554
00:40:23,633 --> 00:40:26,861
Why'd my parents leave me in a monastery?

555
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:31,700
I'd like to know what my parents look like...

556
00:40:32,703 --> 00:40:34,972
So that if I ever met them...

557
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:38,243
I could avoid them

558
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:42,046
Don't fall off!
Don't fall off!

559
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,987
Your life is better than mine was...

560
00:40:46,022 --> 00:40:48,184
At least you have a Master!

561
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,852
Were you an orphan, too?

562
00:40:51,194 --> 00:40:52,321
No...

563
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,685
I was sold as soon as I was born...

564
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,994
Whoever bought me became my parents...

565
00:41:00,036 --> 00:41:02,772
Finally a rich man
took me as his 2nd wife...

566
00:41:04,107 --> 00:41:07,410
I was murdered by his mistress,
and buried here

567
00:41:12,802 --> 00:41:14,151
That's the first time
I've told this story

568
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:15,778
I was lying

569
00:41:17,654 --> 00:41:19,884
I'm glad it's a lie...

570
00:41:20,223 --> 00:41:21,858
If it were true,
it would be tragic

571
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,241
So in comparison, you're free now...

572
00:41:24,241 --> 00:41:26,230
Not being sold again and again...

573
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,129
Pity you're a ghost,
we could've been friends

574
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:35,537
Aren't we friends now?

575
00:41:39,676 --> 00:41:46,411
Little monk,
could you get close to anyone else?

576
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:47,680
I don't know

577
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:50,549
Do you think I'm beautiful?

578
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:54,688
I don't know

579
00:42:04,234 --> 00:42:06,028
Oh no, Master's returned, run away!

580
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:26,130
Fong, what are you doing?

581
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,495
Master, I'm just repairing the stairs...

582
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:30,758
Wait outside, it's almost done

583
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:38,604
The feeling of evil is stronger today

584
00:42:39,202 --> 00:42:41,410
Master, you can't go inside

585
00:42:41,705 --> 00:42:42,970
Why?

586
00:42:43,874 --> 00:42:45,433
There are snakes inside

587
00:42:45,976 --> 00:42:47,187
Snakes?

588
00:42:48,545 --> 00:42:51,221
My powers protect
and make me immune to venom...

589
00:42:51,221 --> 00:42:53,140
Snakes don't come near me

590
00:42:57,888 --> 00:42:59,452
She must be gone by now!

591
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:04,322
The demons are close by

592
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:11,058
Fong

593
00:43:12,002 --> 00:43:13,969
Why're you holding a comb?

594
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:17,738
I bought it, to...

595
00:43:17,774 --> 00:43:20,038
comb my eyebrows,
it looks great...

596
00:43:20,076 --> 00:43:21,603
You want to try it?

597
00:43:21,845 --> 00:43:26,182
Shave your eyebrows
and you won't need a comb

598
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:31,745
Where's the Gold Buddha?

599
00:43:38,061 --> 00:43:41,329
It's over there Master, see it?

600
00:43:41,932 --> 00:43:44,059
Fong, close all the windows

601
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,209
Why close them?

602
00:43:45,209 --> 00:43:47,460
To stop the demons entering

603
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:50,168
Very clever, Master!

604
00:44:01,685 --> 00:44:04,186
Thank God, Master didn't run into her!

605
00:44:40,023 --> 00:44:42,758
Fong, bring me the gold paint

606
00:44:43,193 --> 00:44:44,387
Okay

607
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,428
Oh, it was on the table

608
00:45:10,787 --> 00:45:12,212
Your gold paint

609
00:45:13,356 --> 00:45:15,381
Oh no, it's finished, Master

610
00:45:15,425 --> 00:45:17,059
I haven't written on
all the windows yet...

611
00:45:18,728 --> 00:45:20,953
Bring out all our holy objects

612
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:25,160
Seal all the entrances

613
00:45:34,177 --> 00:45:35,644
Oh no!

614
00:45:44,254 --> 00:45:47,646
Fong, what is it?
Did you see something?

615
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:51,716
It's just that I haven't eaten all day...

616
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:54,693
I'm feeling a big faint...

617
00:45:55,398 --> 00:45:57,059
Master, let me help you

618
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,658
I found you some food.
Get it from my bag

619
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,161
The ghosts will come from this direction...

620
00:46:04,707 --> 00:46:06,576
But we've run out of holy objects

621
00:46:06,576 --> 00:46:07,977
There's a gap over there...

622
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:09,713
Why don't you hang it up there?

623
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:14,473
This is where the evil's the strongest.
I'll repel it

624
00:46:43,379 --> 00:46:46,342
Master, some ghost took your beads!

625
00:47:08,338 --> 00:47:11,939
Strange,
how could a ghost take my beads?

626
00:47:14,344 --> 00:47:15,504
I'll get rid of all of them!

627
00:47:21,885 --> 00:47:23,716
Help!

628
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,447
Fong is in trouble!

629
00:47:25,488 --> 00:47:27,046
Little monk!

630
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,884
You shameless demon!

631
00:47:40,703 --> 00:47:42,880
Help! Help

632
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,034
Help me! Master!
Help! Master!

633
00:47:53,616 --> 00:47:54,840
Mercy shrouds the world!

634
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:04,756
Help me!

635
00:48:04,894 --> 00:48:06,987
The stars will scatter!

636
00:48:15,505 --> 00:48:16,497
Fong, listen to me...

637
00:48:16,539 --> 00:48:18,734
Go back and bring me my holy objects

638
00:48:18,775 --> 00:48:19,935
Right!

639
00:48:38,394 --> 00:48:42,660
Mercy is boundless!

640
00:48:45,001 --> 00:48:47,132
I warned you not to play with that staff

641
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,598
Help!

642
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:55,975
Are you alright?

643
00:48:56,346 --> 00:48:57,841
Get it away from me!

644
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:02,311
How come you are... so cold?

645
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:06,678
Ghosts get cold before they fade away!

646
00:49:07,023 --> 00:49:09,150
Leave me alone, I have to rest...

647
00:49:09,192 --> 00:49:12,059
Otherwise I won't survive as a ghost

648
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,298
Right, I'll go and save Master then

649
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,466
It doesn't look like you can move

650
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:29,874
Have you recovered?
I must go and save Master

651
00:49:34,951 --> 00:49:36,783
Hush!

652
00:49:38,955 --> 00:49:40,582
It feels cold!
What's happening?

653
00:49:40,623 --> 00:49:42,682
One of my sisters is here

654
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:46,428
Good. I'll ask her to help you!

655
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:48,191
No, we hate each other

656
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:50,426
If you bring her here,
we'll both be in trouble

657
00:49:50,466 --> 00:49:51,433
So what can we do?

658
00:49:51,467 --> 00:49:53,162
I can smell a human

659
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:54,701
Let's have a look

660
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:55,872
Don't worry I have the staff

661
00:49:55,872 --> 00:49:57,333
There's no time

662
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,872
Oh, it's you!

663
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:07,382
Are you surprised?

664
00:50:07,417 --> 00:50:10,648
Fooling around behind the Priestess's back?

665
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:13,417
How dare you disobey her orders?

666
00:50:13,456 --> 00:50:15,384
Why do you look so ill?

667
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:18,526
Maybe you're the one fooling around!

668
00:50:19,062 --> 00:50:21,223
Are you bitching because you feel guilty?

669
00:50:21,998 --> 00:50:24,967
I helped the Priestess fight the two monks...

670
00:50:25,001 --> 00:50:27,393
and I got wounded...

671
00:50:28,204 --> 00:50:30,095
Come over and help me...

672
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,425
Why should I help you?

673
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:36,763
Just because you're her pet,
you put on these airs...

674
00:50:36,763 --> 00:50:39,058
I'm sorry, I have no time

675
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:41,928
What was that?

676
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:46,800
Someone's hiding behind me

677
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,164
Who?

678
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:50,805
The little monk

679
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:53,044
Really?

680
00:50:58,117 --> 00:51:00,783
Trying to trick me into helping you?

681
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:05,888
No chance!
I'd never help you!

682
00:51:05,925 --> 00:51:09,694
Why don't you stay,
and wait for the Priestess

683
00:51:10,363 --> 00:51:12,188
You're so cunning...

684
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:18,429
Trying to delay me
from helping the Priestess...

685
00:51:18,671 --> 00:51:20,938
I won't fall for your tricks...

686
00:51:21,974 --> 00:51:23,665
Let's go
