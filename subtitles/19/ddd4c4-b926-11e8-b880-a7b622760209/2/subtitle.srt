1
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,366
That was a bit bluff...

2
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,369
If she'd believed you,
I'd be dead

3
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,303
But if we didn't hate each other...

4
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:22,828
you wouldn't have had to hide

5
00:00:22,873 --> 00:00:25,535
So you change your story
as it pleases you?

6
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:27,168
Fong!

7
00:00:28,312 --> 00:00:30,644
I can't take you further.
I must save Master...

8
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,171
You be on your way

9
00:00:32,516 --> 00:00:33,448
Fong

10
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:34,710
What?

11
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:38,179
I was called Lotus when I was alive

12
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,952
Why're you telling me?
I won't be visiting you...

13
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:42,891
and you won't be visiting me...

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,190
Man and ghost can't be together...

15
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,360
and even if you were human,
it'd be hopeless...

16
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:51,390
because monks and women
can't be together...

17
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,699
Remember,
be more careful in future...

18
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:56,362
If you meet any other monks...

19
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,533
they won't give you a chance

20
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:03,572
Take care of yourself!

21
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,693
Damn monk,
think you're the most powerful?!

22
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,597
Tree Devil, you kill innocents,
and insult God...

23
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,467
I'm going to capture you...

24
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,472
That will your punishment

25
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,304
Punishment?
You mean I will reap what I sow?

26
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,368
Exactly!
Those are the karmic rules

27
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:38,848
Don't you know wicked people
are buried with honour...

28
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,715
Their deeds enshrined in books and songs!

29
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:46,354
But when dead,
they suffer in hell...

30
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,290
Hell is only as dark as the human world...

31
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,691
Only the powerful and ruthless thrive...

32
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,457
There's still time
to change your ways, bald monk!

33
00:01:53,497 --> 00:01:55,294
I've been to hell,
so I know...

34
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:57,800
Maybe you should go
and see for yourself!

35
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,894
Master! Your staff!

36
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:03,135
But I used it to pin down the other ghost!

37
00:02:03,974 --> 00:02:06,101
The dark deep underworld arise!

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,447
There is no justice!

39
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,972
Master!

40
00:02:39,009 --> 00:02:42,035
Evil will win, and never fatter!

41
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,342
Fong, give me the Gold Buddha!

42
00:02:48,385 --> 00:02:49,545
Right!

43
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:55,247
I forgot to tell you it's broken!

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,657
Now you tell me!

45
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:08,568
Master!

46
00:03:16,513 --> 00:03:18,845
Fong,
ride my staff with the Buddha...

47
00:03:18,882 --> 00:03:21,942
Get it fixed,
then come and save me

48
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,179
Master!

49
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,941
Master!

50
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,113
Fong!

51
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,984
Who is it?
Show yourself!

52
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,491
Leave quickly!

53
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:07,827
The Priestess will be back soon!

54
00:04:07,864 --> 00:04:09,991
Follow my cloak!

55
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:12,695
You can't fight the Priestess...

56
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,602
Don't look back,

57
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,972
just move forward...

58
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:28,046
Remember not to look back...

59
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:32,983
Never come back!

60
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,253
Never come back!

61
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,394
It's getting light

62
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:51,499
Come and look, brand new weapons

63
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,736
Come and look

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,739
You're from Shaolin Temple?
Special price!

65
00:04:58,782 --> 00:04:59,942
I have no money

66
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:00,915
Who shall I ask?

67
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,418
We use real iron

68
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,612
I'll think about it

69
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:05,553
For every $10 spent,
a free horseshoe!

70
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:06,749
I'll give you two

71
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,018
I'm only here to beg for food

72
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,049
Beg for food? Get lost!

73
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:15,792
The world's corrupt,
it's hard to find honesty

74
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,394
Let me help you!

75
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:21,862
Little monk, this place is bad,
go elsewhere

76
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,839
Brother,
you're a blacksmith aren't you?

77
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,172
Not much longer,
a decent man can't survive here

78
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:27,471
Will you do business with me?

79
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:28,705
I don't sell weapons

80
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,906
I don't want weapons,
I need repairs...

81
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,676
Have a look

82
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:37,510
You crazy?
If it's seen, you'll be dead...

83
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,680
Put it away!

84
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:40,246
Please help me, it's an emergency!

85
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,190
Is this Buddha yours,
or did you steal it?

86
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,022
Do I look like a thief?

87
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:45,995
Alright then, I'll do a good deed

88
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,724
You are so kind

89
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:54,601
Thank you

90
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:01,676
I thought,
you were going to fix the Gold Buddha?

91
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,110
What Gold Buddha?
I didn't see any...

92
00:06:03,146 --> 00:06:05,080
What Gold Buddha?
You just threw it in there!

93
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,242
Leave me alone,
I don't want your business, scram!

94
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,479
Give it back...
I need it to save someone...

95
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,986
Give my Gold Buddha back!

96
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:12,283
Help!

97
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:14,813
Give it back, or I'll kill you!

98
00:06:15,926 --> 00:06:17,393
I'm being beaten up by a monk!

99
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:20,089
I don't want trouble,
but he stole my Gold Buddha

100
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,994
Gold?

101
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:22,328
Not gold, just my Buddha

102
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:24,629
Search him,
maybe he's carrying more gold

103
00:06:24,668 --> 00:06:26,226
I'm not, I'm not...

104
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,531
Get him!

105
00:06:27,571 --> 00:06:29,095
Get him!

106
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,934
What the hell?

107
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,945
It's the little monk!

108
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,779
It's you?
They stole something from me

109
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,250
Let's go!

110
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,378
Do you want me to help you?

111
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,410
Yes

112
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,582
Your Master owes me $10...

113
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,252
With this, it's a total of $15

114
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:52,921
They... they stole my Gold Buddha

115
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:54,362
Gold? Hang on...

116
00:06:54,397 --> 00:06:56,058
Makes it more pricey,
an extra 300...

117
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,829
Plus a bowl of noodles, that's $320

118
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,200
But I have no money!

119
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,169
Goodbye!

120
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,603
But my Master has some

121
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,767
That makes it okay!
I won't cheat you, let's go

122
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:11,912
Quickly!

123
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:12,846
Calm down!

124
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,214
It's them!

125
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,412
- Brothers...
- They're here ...that Gold Buddha is mine...

126
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:18,546
It should be returned
to it's rightful owner

127
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:21,421
Who says? Finders keepers,
just because you've got a big sword

128
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:23,187
There are more of us!

129
00:07:23,226 --> 00:07:24,386
Attack!

130
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,591
Let's melt it, goodbye Gold Buddha!

131
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,857
The Gold Buddha!

132
00:07:39,976 --> 00:07:42,604
Oh no, it's melted!

133
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,443
You're amazing?

134
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:45,709
What's amazing?

135
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:47,613
Isn't it hot?

136
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,852
I wonder if it still has any powers?

137
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,220
Master is in real trouble now...

138
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:55,918
Don't be negative,
there's always a way...

139
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,687
Little monk...

140
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,318
Let's go and get money from your Master

141
00:07:58,361 --> 00:07:59,885
But I haven't worked out how to save him

142
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,524
That's easy, hire me to help you save him...

143
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,524
I'll give you a special discount,
2 times $300...

144
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:06,333
What do you think?

145
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:07,768
Forget it, no deal

146
00:08:07,804 --> 00:08:09,066
Get out of my way!
I'll kill you!

147
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:10,629
Don't you want to save your Master?

148
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,971
Of course I do

149
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,373
Then you have to pay me

150
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,809
But I have no money

151
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,106
Will you do it on credit?

152
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:17,704
Sure! It's a big deal

153
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,476
Wonton noodles!

154
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,843
Hey,
you look like you're starving...

155
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,353
Have some noodles!

156
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,786
I told you I have no money

157
00:08:25,822 --> 00:08:27,255
It's okay, I'll keep a tab...

158
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,417
You'll have to pay up
when it reaches $1,000

159
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:48,944
Don't worry,
as long as I'm around it'll be fine

160
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:51,743
Hey, I don't even know your name

161
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,079
My name's Yin (red dawn)

162
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,210
That's quite a name

163
00:08:56,553 --> 00:09:01,013
It was someone else's name,
a high Priest...

164
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:03,548
I begged him
to take me in as his student...

165
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:06,084
But he said he didn't like people...

166
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,926
and refused to teach me!

167
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,091
You see, he's really stubborn!

168
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,710
Maybe if you ask again,
he'll change his mind

169
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:23,406
He's dead now!

170
00:09:23,446 --> 00:09:26,882
He was antisocial
so had no friends...

171
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,749
Not even money to buy a coffin!

172
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:33,722
I've learnt my lesson,
money before everything!

173
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:35,850
Why's that?

174
00:09:35,892 --> 00:09:39,589
With money you can be whatever you want!

175
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,597
What do you want to be?

176
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,394
A rich Yin!

177
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:46,493
And what do you want to be?

178
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:48,967
A good man!

179
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,168
A good man? Like my namesake?

180
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,200
Living a lonely life.
You think good reaps good?

181
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,713
All good men end like that!

182
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:02,013
Help! A ghost!

183
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,452
Someone's in trouble!

184
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:06,714
Don't worry, it's her!

185
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:10,888
Help, help! Open the door!

186
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,788
There's a ghost after me!

187
00:10:17,567 --> 00:10:19,467
Hey, it's me, hey...

188
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,700
Ghost... help me

189
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,732
Hey, she's on our side...
it's me...

190
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,742
I've been waiting for you,
it's Fong...

191
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:29,938
You can stop all
the dancing around...

192
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,970
Hey, stop it, stop it

193
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,175
Stop it?!

194
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:38,182
Who are you?

195
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,881
I'm so scared!

196
00:10:43,793 --> 00:10:45,317
Come over here

197
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,026
I don't get it.
Explain what you're doing

198
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,764
I can't, it's all a mistake

199
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,005
Something over there's moving!

200
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,283
Yes...
I know a ghost's after you...

201
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:14,654
Then you must protect me!

202
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:16,522
I know you need protection

203
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,128
But we're not suited to each other

204
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,759
Why?

205
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,825
I mean...
I don't mean you're not pretty...

206
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:28,929
To be honest...
Please don't get angry, but I...

207
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:32,368
I don't go for your type,
that's all...

208
00:11:33,643 --> 00:11:37,044
I prefer a longer face,
slight buck teeth

209
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,605
Maybe that much taller than me

210
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:40,911
Ow!

211
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,385
If you know her,
go and ask her to come here

212
00:11:49,826 --> 00:11:51,555
Be careful not to burn your clothes

213
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:56,054
You're so bad,
you want a manage a trios?

214
00:11:56,099 --> 00:11:57,327
What's that?

215
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,961
You studious types are so naughty

216
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:01,493
Ow!

217
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:12,476
Hey, come over here!

218
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:16,379
Lady, just hang on a moment

219
00:12:18,922 --> 00:12:21,720
Wait here,
I'm just going over for a chat

220
00:12:23,226 --> 00:12:23,954
What's the matter?

221
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,927
She's not right for you,
but she is for me...

222
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:28,522
I don't want your money,
I'll have her instead

223
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:29,691
No way!

224
00:12:29,732 --> 00:12:31,597
What, you've undressed her?

225
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,194
No need to undress,
let's do it like this!

226
00:12:34,237 --> 00:12:35,898
Give that to me!

227
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,838
No,
the clothes are stuck to my hands!

228
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,806
I said no, I don't know her!

229
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,571
Come on!

230
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,977
Another piece of clothing?

231
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,680
You don't know her,
but you remove her underwear?!

232
00:12:51,721 --> 00:12:53,154
Put it on, put it on!

233
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,451
I don't care, I want her!

234
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,651
I'm paying you instead

235
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,624
I don't want money!

236
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:57,956
I don't want money, I want her!

237
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,086
No!

238
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:00,755
Hey, what're you doing?

239
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:03,459
Hey, now about if I pay you?

240
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,663
Look,
I'm giving you a good deal!

241
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,933
Just stop it, it's been decided

242
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,872
I'm sorry Miss!

243
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,836
It's the first time I've played this game!

244
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,674
I'm sorry to bother you...

245
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,510
Remember, long face,
slight buck teeth when she smiles...

246
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:21,812
About 6 inches taller than me, thanks!

247
00:13:23,186 --> 00:13:25,120
What a waste,
you didn't even ask her name...

248
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:26,382
How can we find her again?

249
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:27,912
We're here to save my Master...

250
00:13:27,957 --> 00:13:29,219
Not do that sort of thing...

251
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,420
If you want it so much,
come back another time

252
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:33,520
Don't worry, I will!

253
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,793
Help! Help!

254
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:36,696
I'll go!

255
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,223
I'm going!

256
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:39,792
Help!

257
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,441
It's you!
Why are you back here?

258
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,943
I'm so glad,
it's finally your turn!

259
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,509
These ghosts are beauties...
...she's even better

260
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,349
I almost mistook the last girl for you!

261
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,354
Who was here?

262
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,821
Your sister!

263
00:14:00,623 --> 00:14:02,056
Anymore sisters?

264
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,555
We'll be discovered here,
let's go upstairs

265
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:06,755
Right

266
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:10,658
There's no one else!
Going to keep here for yourself?

267
00:14:13,836 --> 00:14:15,997
Hey. What are you doing?

268
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:19,000
What?

269
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:20,202
What are you doing?

270
00:14:20,243 --> 00:14:21,210
Pretending to be intimate!

271
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:22,141
Pretending to be intimate?

272
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,408
He's Yin,
I've employed him to help save Master...

273
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:25,812
She's Lotus

274
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,507
Hey, what are you doing?

275
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,108
Pretending to be intimate

276
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,546
You don't have to as well
stand aside and watch!

277
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,286
I don't trust you

278
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:37,623
Damn monk, if you can why can't I?

279
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,059
Don't use business as an excuse for pleasure

280
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,687
Do you think I want this?

281
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,959
I'm a reluctant victim too

282
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,830
We're not looking very convincing...

283
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:46,129
Let's get into bed!

284
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,101
Into bed?

285
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,728
Into bed?
If you won't do it, I will!

286
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,898
You won't go to be! I will!

287
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,567
How come I can't?

288
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:56,201
Come on

289
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:07,923
It's better if you're on top

290
00:15:12,228 --> 00:15:14,890
Let's make it clear,
no more praying!

291
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:17,024
I'll try my best, what next?

292
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,761
Next we kiss!

293
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:37,616
Undaunted by the misty fog

294
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,744
Behind the mystery is a sweet surprise

295
00:15:40,322 --> 00:15:41,687
Dashing through the sun and moon

296
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:43,488
Dancing to the beat of the gong

297
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:48,860
Nothing can dempen my chivalry

298
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:55,593
Stop the noise, this a serious business!

299
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:59,068
Nothing can stop my will to strike again

300
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,406
Do you know where Master is?

301
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:05,505
The priestess's got him,
but I don't know where

302
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,210
How can we get her to come here?

303
00:16:08,251 --> 00:16:10,048
There's a bell on my ankle...

304
00:16:10,086 --> 00:16:12,646
She'll answer it if she hears it ring

305
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,088
A bell?

306
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,216
So why don't you ring it?

307
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:21,128
Don't stop,
or they might suspect us, carry on!

308
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,632
Don't stick your tongue into my stomach!

309
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:27,135
I won't, we'll just kiss!

310
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,229
That's okay!

311
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:19,853
I can't bear it,
I'm going for a walk!

312
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:21,754
Hey, don't go!

313
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,452
I can't be bothered to watch

314
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:27,695
Yin, where are you going?

315
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,788
For a walk!

316
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,958
You can't go, stay here

317
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,024
Go away

318
00:17:32,068 --> 00:17:33,763
What will I do if you go?

319
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,068
I can't bear watching you two

320
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:39,267
Young student!

321
00:17:40,176 --> 00:17:43,145
Open the door,
I'm so scared outside

322
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,044
Let me come in

323
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:46,048
She's so scared!

324
00:17:46,082 --> 00:17:47,242
What's that got to do with you?

325
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,341
It's Butterfly!

326
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:50,579
You wait here, I'll handle her

327
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,088
Don't go, the two of us are rivals

328
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:54,953
Even better,
then there won't be any bickering

329
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:56,686
You're really a pain in the neck...

330
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,250
Carry on like this and I won't pay you

331
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,194
Don't mention money,
I haven't seen a cent yet...

332
00:18:00,229 --> 00:18:01,560
Where's the money? Huh?

333
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:03,394
Hush!

334
00:18:03,432 --> 00:18:06,595
Lotus,
lend me some money so I can pay him...

335
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,001
Just so I can shut him up!

336
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,436
I don't want money,
he wants me to take it...

337
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:11,940
I'm happy with alternatives

338
00:18:11,974 --> 00:18:14,101
You can talk, but touch her

339
00:18:14,477 --> 00:18:16,468
See, if you don't help me,
he won't help me...

340
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,412
So you've got to help me

341
00:18:18,447 --> 00:18:20,642
You two are trouble, I'm going

342
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,672
Let me protect you

343
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,082
Forget it!

344
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:30,016
So you got thrown out too?

345
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,720
No such luck...

346
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:34,730
Those two fought over me...

347
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,823
If not for the fact
they've got more friends coming...

348
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,266
I would have left ages ago

349
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,703
Don't stand here, go in and help

350
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:46,931
Lady,
we students love playing games...

351
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:48,739
Let's have some fun!

352
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:49,767
Okay!

353
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:54,010
I said you weren't my type,
don't hang around

354
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:57,151
Open up, open the door

355
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,154
I have no time for you

356
00:18:59,188 --> 00:19:02,521
I don't believe I'm less attractive than Lotus!

357
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,589
You can't force your way in!

358
00:19:06,629 --> 00:19:08,290
I want you to fancy me

359
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:11,732
Seduce me, I'm easy to seduce!

360
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,758
Can't we talk a bit first?

361
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,134
I can't wait

362
00:19:15,171 --> 00:19:17,731
You have no hair! You're a monk!

363
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:21,607
You're that old monk's student?

364
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,181
Fong, come up!

365
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,916
Demon, take my spell!

366
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:41,729
Soldiers of wind and fire heed,
the spell is cast!

367
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:46,130
Heaven and earth move,
lend me your powers!

368
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,933
Wow!

369
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:52,235
Follow her!

370
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:02,710
Damn, she's got my sword

371
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,946
You like playing games?
I'll kill you

372
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:08,889
Belittling me?
Let's see who wins!

373
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:12,622
Little monk, I've been waiting for you
to save your Master...

374
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,994
I was wondering who
you'd find to help you...

375
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:17,693
and you get a midget with a giant's sword...

376
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,997
You want to amuse me,
so I die happy?

377
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:23,802
Old witch, careful you'll die laughing

378
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,606
Do something quickly!

379
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,699
I haven't begun my chanting yet

380
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,835
- Don't scare me, it's too late too look for a spell now!
- Shut up!

381
00:20:28,878 --> 00:20:30,311
Let's bet

382
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,952
Yin, chop this side first

383
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,588
Chop...

384
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,360
They keep multiplying,
cast any old spell

385
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,703
What spell?
I can't even open my manuscript

386
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:00,174
I'm going!

387
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:04,135
Trying to escape?

388
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,341
You coward!

389
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:13,847
Lotus!

390
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,551
I'll help you get away

391
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:23,964
Come on!

392
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:28,394
I almost missed you two

393
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:31,201
Bastard, you ran away,
you've no loyalty

394
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,333
I was sacrificing myself
to distract her...

395
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,934
But she didn't fall for it,
what can I do?

396
00:21:34,977 --> 00:21:37,275
So that means I get
sacrificed instead?

397
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:41,544
Stop arguing.
Let's get out of Orchid Temple

398
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,754
Let's hide

399
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,997
I can't let the Priestess see me here

400
00:21:57,033 --> 00:22:00,127
We'll work together, and distract him!

401
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,500
Hey, catch!

402
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:08,069
Going to fight me with your little games?

403
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:10,374
My little games will kill you

404
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,882
Is that all you're capable of?

405
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,150
That wasn't for real,
but my next move is!

406
00:22:20,656 --> 00:22:23,523
Miraculous armour, go!

407
00:22:26,996 --> 00:22:30,056
You decide to change your clothes now?

408
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,464
I'm off

409
00:22:32,234 --> 00:22:36,000
Trying to trick her again?

410
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:44,745
Let's go!

411
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:51,309
Priestess, you've been wounded!

412
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:53,821
How could we let him get away!

413
00:22:53,856 --> 00:22:56,791
Did he think he could hurt me?

414
00:23:09,672 --> 00:23:10,400
You won't get me!

415
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,464
Keep running away like that,
and even if you save me...

416
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,338
I'll die of fright!

417
00:23:14,376 --> 00:23:16,207
This is strategy, do you understand?

418
00:23:16,245 --> 00:23:18,179
At least you could have warned me

419
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:20,079
I'm saving you and all you do is complain...

420
00:23:20,116 --> 00:23:23,381
You still owe me money,
where's the money?

421
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,610
Lotus

422
00:23:26,422 --> 00:23:29,585
I mentioned borrowing some money, I...

423
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,526
Not now,
I've got to be careful when I get back

424
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,825
Why don't you leave Orchid Temple with us?

425
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:37,161
Your situation's dangerous;
don't go back...

426
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:38,962
Why not leave with us?

427
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,992
You can be a ghost anywhere

428
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,765
No, I'm used to this...

429
00:23:42,805 --> 00:23:47,242
I suffered before,
I prefer living day by day...

430
00:23:47,276 --> 00:23:50,677
Not like you,
not knowing what tomorrow will bring

431
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:52,442
It doesn't matter not knowing

432
00:23:52,481 --> 00:23:53,880
Don't try and change my mind!

433
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,907
Here I live well and dress well

434
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,509
I'm not related to you...

435
00:23:57,553 --> 00:24:00,044
What place do I have following you around?

436
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,717
I can't talk anyone,
I have to go...

437
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:04,555
Forget about me

438
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:10,829
She said we don't know where we're going

439
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,424
She's right...

440
00:24:12,468 --> 00:24:14,299
Let's take care of ourselves first

441
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,963
That means we forget about her...

442
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,438
You said it

443
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:40,558
Jade, is the Priestess back yet?

444
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:42,427
The Priestess?

445
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,897
No

446
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,724
Then start combing my hair...

447
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:49,533
If she comes back,
say I never went out

448
00:24:58,948 --> 00:25:00,779
What's wrong?

449
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:05,214
Nothing...
I'll miss you...

450
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:09,156
In two days I'll marry the Mountain Devil...

451
00:25:09,191 --> 00:25:13,218
Whatever happens,
you're always my sister

452
00:25:14,363 --> 00:25:18,390
I'll talk to the Priestess,
someone else can marry him...

453
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:21,369
Then we can stay together

454
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,177
Lotus, I really love you

455
00:25:34,216 --> 00:25:37,515
I believed, that when you went out,
you were a good girl...

456
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:41,546
Tell me where they are hiding?

457
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,457
Priestess, forgive me,
I was wrong

458
00:25:44,493 --> 00:25:46,290
Forgive you?

459
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:51,825
Tell me, how should I punish her?

460
00:25:51,867 --> 00:25:53,926
Jade, you tell me

461
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:59,567
Why don't we, don't we...

462
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:03,006
marry her to the Mountain Devil

463
00:26:03,045 --> 00:26:05,013
Jade, you?

464
00:26:05,047 --> 00:26:09,006
Sold when you're alive,
and sold when you're dead...

465
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:14,114
That Demon has many concubines,
you'll suffer!

466
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:18,415
You betrayed me!
Cut off her hair

467
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:27,431
What a waste of beautiful hair

468
00:26:27,469 --> 00:26:29,369
I've spent so much time combing it...

469
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:31,373
What a waste!

470
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,097
Scissors!

471
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:42,313
Jade, didn't you just call me your sister?

472
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:44,683
You knew the Priestess was hiding here...

473
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,483
Why did you betray me?

474
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,353
For her own good...

475
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:50,551
I'm going to scratch your face!

476
00:26:52,328 --> 00:26:55,161
Priestess, please forgive me!

477
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,721
Go to hell!

478
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,256
Please forgive Lotus!

479
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:03,663
Jade...

480
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,270
Sister...

481
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,301
Don't worry, I'll marry in your place

482
00:27:10,346 --> 00:27:12,576
Crocodile tears

483
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:15,909
But I won't let you get away

484
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,885
Let who get away?
Come here!

485
00:27:18,654 --> 00:27:22,522
You're sisters!
You'll both marry the Mountain Devil

486
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,458
Scratch her face!

487
00:27:24,493 --> 00:27:26,552
Priestess, don't...

488
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:28,654
Won't you forgive me?

489
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,133
You want me to really damage your face?

490
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,158
I want her face scratched to hell

491
00:27:34,203 --> 00:27:35,329
Is this it?

492
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:36,269
Yes!

493
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:37,602
Come on!

494
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,471
I'm one of you!

495
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,708
Who are you?

496
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,774
Lotus?

497
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,341
Run away!

498
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:53,583
Don't be afraid,
Buddha'll protect us, good will win...

499
00:27:53,622 --> 00:27:55,283
You better let her go!

500
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:56,313
Hands off!

501
00:27:56,358 --> 00:27:58,223
or I'll blow you up...

502
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,591
I'll come back and fight later

503
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:00,993
Come back!

504
00:28:01,964 --> 00:28:04,194
I'm going to eat him first

505
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:08,031
You can lick me, but no kissing!

506
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:14,304
Did I save the wrong girl?

507
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:16,837
You'd better turn over a new leaf

508
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:18,244
I will!

509
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:24,078
I better take you back,
you can't be tamed!

510
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,979
I'm back!

511
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,223
I'm off!

512
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,122
Sister, run!

513
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,025
Jade!

514
00:28:37,699 --> 00:28:39,257
Jade!

515
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,500
You witch - still dare
to call my fighting 'games'?

516
00:28:47,543 --> 00:28:49,704
Next time I'll blow up your nest!

517
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:50,677
Jade!

518
00:28:50,712 --> 00:28:52,703
We're far away from it now

519
00:28:52,748 --> 00:28:54,409
It doesn't matter how far we go

520
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,439
Why?

521
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:57,247
What are you two up to back there?

522
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,278
My urn of ashes
is in the hands of the Priestess...

523
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,688
Under the 1,000 year old tree,
at daybreak...

524
00:29:02,724 --> 00:29:04,487
My soul will have to return there

525
00:29:04,526 --> 00:29:05,925
I promise you I'll find your urn of ashes

526
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:06,950
Don't depend on me to help

527
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,087
Concentrate on flying!

528
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,290
Be careful!

529
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:15,202
What did you just say?

530
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,568
You're going to back out now?

531
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:19,472
I do one thing, something else happens,
it never ends

532
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,736
So what?

533
00:29:20,776 --> 00:29:22,471
I'll never be able to work out my payment!

534
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,978
Add you stupidity,
plus my naivete and intelligence...

535
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,071
You should also add
your greediness and heartlessness...

536
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:27,604
In the end you're just jealous of me!

537
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:28,638
Jealous of you?

538
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:30,242
You two are always in an hot embrace...

539
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:32,412
I never get a chance!

540
00:29:32,454 --> 00:29:34,718
I don't know what type of monk you are,
but I'm also human

541
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:36,656
I need love too!

542
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,819
I'm only doing this to save someone

543
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:41,523
Stop fighting!
The Priestess isn't easy to handle...

544
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:44,361
I don't think I'll ever get away...

545
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,893
Fong,
just pretend this never happened

546
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,163
I'll go by myself!

547
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,366
Stop putting it on I won't help you

548
00:29:52,407 --> 00:29:54,068
If you're going to help him, move!

549
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:55,872
Even if he begs me,
I won't go...

550
00:29:55,911 --> 00:29:57,572
But if you beg me,
I may consider it

551
00:29:57,613 --> 00:29:59,410
Well, take your time then

552
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:00,472
Hey!

553
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:01,983
Fong, what're you going to do?

554
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:04,577
Get your urn of ashes,
then save Master

555
00:30:07,689 --> 00:30:10,180
That would be suicide!

556
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,420
Give yourself a break...

557
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:14,258
It's none of your business!

558
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:22,470
Look what you've done to me...

559
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,972
If not for you, I wouldn't be in this mess

560
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:27,237
I saved you, and you're blaming me?

561
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:30,712
You can't fight me,
how can you help me?

562
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,658
I'm not afraid,
I'm not afraid

563
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,674
It's getting light,
I can't stop you

564
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:07,807
No one'll help me,
I'll have to help myself

565
00:31:14,489 --> 00:31:15,956
Take care

566
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:44,610
I knew I'd find you!

567
00:31:52,294 --> 00:31:54,888
So many urns!
How to find hers?

568
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,056
Let's look together

569
00:31:56,098 --> 00:31:58,965
I don't need your help,
I can't afford you

570
00:32:04,573 --> 00:32:05,801
The likely ones go on this side

571
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,309
I wonder which one contains Lotus's ashes?

572
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,901
None of your business!

573
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,904
Smart ass!

574
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:14,381
This might be

575
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,215
Or, this could be too

576
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:26,221
It's so big!
Lotus wasn't so fat...

577
00:32:26,261 --> 00:32:28,456
It goes on that side...

578
00:32:35,504 --> 00:32:37,734
How am I going to carry all of these?

579
00:32:40,742 --> 00:32:44,041
Want me to get a horse and cart?

580
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:46,479
Forget it, I can't afford it

581
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:48,506
Just for you, I won't charge

582
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:52,552
Abracadabra - show the way!

583
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:58,286
Look and see if it's in that urn

584
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,194
It really is Lotus!
We found it!

585
00:33:07,602 --> 00:33:10,070
Put it away then!

586
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:12,232
Tree Devil,
how dare you belittle me!

587
00:33:12,274 --> 00:33:14,333
I'm going to burn you up...

588
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,469
Then let's see what you can do?

589
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:25,144
The old monk!

590
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:27,178
I've found your Master

591
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,656
Bring him down please!

592
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:31,124
Okay!

593
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,027
How is he?

594
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:34,528
I can't tell!

595
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:40,394
His eyes are swollen

596
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:48,234
Master!

597
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,006
Move your Master,
I'm going to burn the tree

598
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,515
It's raining,
let's get out of the rain...

599
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:58,383
If it doesn't stop raining, we'll run

600
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,562
I'm angry we didn't burn that old witch!

601
00:34:10,365 --> 00:34:13,163
Master!
Are your alright, Master!

602
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:20,202
Master, your eyes!

603
00:34:21,042 --> 00:34:22,771
Fong!

604
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,871
You finally made it...

605
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:30,576
Fong, someone else is here,
who is it?

606
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,210
It's me sir... The nice young man

607
00:34:32,254 --> 00:34:35,746
you met at the market

608
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:39,818
Good, you decided to change
your ways, and join us

609
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,921
Yes, I'm not as greedy as you think

610
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,571
We should be safe here

611
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:01,980
There's an inn over there,
we can rest awhile

612
00:35:02,017 --> 00:35:02,813
Okay!

613
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:03,681
Wait!

614
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:04,582
Why?

615
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:06,052
What's the matter, Master?

616
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,698
They're here!

617
00:35:19,734 --> 00:35:20,962
Who is?

618
00:35:21,002 --> 00:35:22,697
Those filthy ones!

619
00:35:22,737 --> 00:35:24,967
What filthy ones?

620
00:35:27,275 --> 00:35:29,903
Fong!

621
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,543
Lotus, it's Lotus!

622
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,578
Lotus!

623
00:35:33,615 --> 00:35:34,604
I'll take care of her

624
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:36,583
Don't Master, she helped us...
She's on our side!

625
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:37,676
Really?

626
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,516
Lotus, I found your urn of ashes

627
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,454
Hold on, there's another one

628
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:46,493
Fong...

629
00:35:46,528 --> 00:35:51,192
Don't believe her,
she's a fake!

630
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,564
Fong, don't believe her,
I'm the real one

631
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:01,139
Which one's real?

632
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,302
How do I know?

633
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:04,073
Which is the real one, Master?

634
00:36:04,112 --> 00:36:05,670
How should I know?

635
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:10,777
Fong, don't believe her, Fong...

636
00:36:20,695 --> 00:36:22,060
Reveal yourself!

637
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:26,793
It's the Tree Devil!

638
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:27,824
Lotus

639
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,097
Hey!

640
00:36:29,137 --> 00:36:30,627
Fong!

641
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,238
Fong!

642
00:36:37,045 --> 00:36:39,980
How come we're still in Orchid Temple?

643
00:36:40,015 --> 00:36:42,609
We never managed
to escape the Tree Devil's grasp!

644
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:44,949
I know where Fong is.
You must go quickly

645
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:47,748
Of course you know where he is!

646
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,689
You lied to us from the beginning...

647
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,658
Now you're trying to trap us

648
00:36:51,693 --> 00:36:53,820
My soul's always been with my urn of ashes...

649
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,592
Like you,
I was set up by the Priestess

650
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,565
Rubbish,
you expect me to believe you?

651
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,897
I'm going to break your urn...

652
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:02,733
and disperse your spirit,
so you won't do more harm

653
00:37:03,171 --> 00:37:05,036
I never lied to you...

654
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:08,338
You think
I let the Tree Devil take Fong on purpose?

655
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:12,035
Yin, don't you believe me?

656
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:15,508
Demon, I'm going to destroy you

657
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,883
Master, let's get the old one,
and let this one go

658
00:37:19,421 --> 00:37:21,252
Go!

659
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,121
Go on!

660
00:37:25,093 --> 00:37:28,893
Fong is in Orchid Temple,
go and save him

661
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,729
Let's go

662
00:37:40,942 --> 00:37:43,001
You dropped your abacus

663
00:37:43,144 --> 00:37:45,408
Forget it,
I'll never make money on this job

664
00:37:45,447 --> 00:37:46,539
Let's go and save Fong

665
00:37:46,581 --> 00:37:47,639
Right

666
00:38:14,742 --> 00:38:16,733
Master, the devil hurt by you...

667
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,310
...is now recovering.

668
00:38:26,321 --> 00:38:27,345
Fong!

669
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,118
Fong, where is he?

670
00:38:29,157 --> 00:38:30,784
Over there!

671
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:34,022
Can't you see,
he's hanging up there

672
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:47,603
Little monk,
I'm going to suck your energy...

673
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,440
Then I'll sell you to the Mountain Devil...

674
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,776
You'll never be able to reincarnate...

675
00:38:52,814 --> 00:38:55,749
and you'll rot in hell!

676
00:38:56,818 --> 00:38:58,183
Butterfly...

677
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:03,052
You can't even handle this monk,
you're useless

678
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,389
Priestess, I can do it!

679
00:39:05,427 --> 00:39:08,123
I'll seduce him, just you watch!

680
00:39:23,678 --> 00:39:24,975
Lotus!

681
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:27,211
How dare you come back!

682
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:29,307
Priestess, I'll finish her off

683
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,046
No, I came for forgiveness...

684
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:33,884
I brought the other two back with me...

685
00:39:33,922 --> 00:39:36,516
They're hiding behind the grass

686
00:39:36,658 --> 00:39:38,922
Damn her, she's sold us out

687
00:39:42,931 --> 00:39:44,558
You witch, how dare you betray us...

688
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,863
I should've destroyed your urn!

689
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:51,001
The underworld is invincible!

690
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:02,240
Abandon law and order!

691
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:05,916
Heaven and earth move, lend your powers!
- Stars scatter - ...sword fly!

692
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:11,790
Cover the skies!

693
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:18,957
Oh my gold!

694
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,592
I'll hold them back!

695
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:24,999
The light of Buddha shines!

696
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,238
Butterfly!

697
00:40:33,448 --> 00:40:35,439
Priestess, help me!

698
00:40:35,483 --> 00:40:39,579
You're wounded, you're useless now,
I need your energy

699
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,918
You old Tree Devil,
you devour your own people!

700
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:48,861
No matter how powerful you are...

701
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:51,627
or that you're in human form,
you're still a demon

702
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,299
Go to hell, take my spell...

703
00:40:55,436 --> 00:40:59,099
Soldiers of wind and fire,
show your power

704
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,943
Why did you betray
my Master and Yin?

705
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,813
How else could I distract the Priestess
and save you?

706
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:12,944
My manuscript!

707
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:15,381
Stars scatter!

708
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,457
Heaven and earth move,
lend your power

709
00:41:23,164 --> 00:41:27,123
The Mountain Devil...

710
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,008
The Mountain Devil will come, run quickly...

711
00:41:34,342 --> 00:41:35,900
You go first!

712
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:37,434
Butterfly!

713
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,977
Fong!

714
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,412
Come on, Lotus

715
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,382
Butterfly!

716
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:46,111
You were right,
leave with the monk...

717
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:49,146
At least you won't end up like this

718
00:41:49,624 --> 00:41:52,320
I was wrong, too!
I shouldn't trust them!

719
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,624
Otherwise,
I won't be a wandering ghost!

720
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:55,993
Quick, help me!

721
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,962
Butterfly!

722
00:41:56,998 --> 00:41:57,896
Help me!

723
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:58,864
Butterfly!

724
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,958
Help me!

725
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,832
Butterfly!

726
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:06,297
Let's go Lotus! Come on!

727
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:09,568
Come with your Master!

728
00:42:10,511 --> 00:42:12,979
We can't get away like this,
step on my cloak!

729
00:42:13,014 --> 00:42:14,311
Onto my cloak

730
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:31,191
Master, wait for Lotus

731
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,666
She's a demon,
don't be seduced by her

732
00:42:33,701 --> 00:42:35,066
Fong!

733
00:42:35,103 --> 00:42:38,504
Lotus, quickly, Lotus!

734
00:42:38,673 --> 00:42:40,698
Fong!

735
00:42:43,044 --> 00:42:44,944
Lotus!

736
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,753
Fong!

737
00:42:54,856 --> 00:42:56,187
Fong!

738
00:42:58,092 --> 00:42:59,821
Lotus?

739
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:03,858
Lotus

740
00:43:03,898 --> 00:43:06,025
Fong, I'm over here!

741
00:43:06,434 --> 00:43:09,028
Lotus, your urn of ashes!

742
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,108
Old monk, your student is down here...

743
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:15,507
Don't you go back to save him?

744
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:18,808
Soldiers of fire and wind,
come, come, come

745
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,876
Buddha be merciful

746
00:43:32,093 --> 00:43:33,321
Master!

747
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,461
Come on up

748
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:50,109
You kill the tree devil
and I bring you all to hell

749
00:43:51,345 --> 00:43:52,209
Mountain devil is coming!

750
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:59,077
Thank you for saving me sir...

751
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,645
I was only trying to save my student

752
00:44:01,689 --> 00:44:03,054
Master, Lotus is really...

753
00:44:03,091 --> 00:44:05,218
Forget it,
there's one hour before daybreak...

754
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:07,693
Once it's light we'll be fine

755
00:44:08,529 --> 00:44:14,331
Come to hell with me, you can't escape!

756
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:20,098
Master, we won't make it!

757
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:25,808
Yin,
let's break a path through it

758
00:44:25,847 --> 00:44:27,940
Right! Heaven and earth move...

759
00:44:27,982 --> 00:44:29,916
- Lend your powers
- The light of Buddha!

760
00:44:30,818 --> 00:44:33,013
We won't make it

761
00:44:33,054 --> 00:44:36,546
I'll use all my life force to fight it

762
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,557
Come on!

763
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:13,122
Fong, is it light yet?

764
00:45:13,261 --> 00:45:14,455
Not yet, Master

765
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:17,328
He's made the skies dark,
we're in his clutches...

766
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:18,798
You take care of the monk,
I'll distract him

767
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,027
You're no match for them

768
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:21,398
I'll find a way

769
00:45:21,436 --> 00:45:22,733
Yin!

770
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,603
Mountain Devil,
I've destroyed your bastard sister

771
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,665
Are you afraid to show yourself?

772
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,175
I'll destroy you!

773
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:31,110
The spell exerts itself!

774
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:39,486
Here I come!

775
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:44,548
He's gone!

776
00:45:45,893 --> 00:45:48,157
What can you do?

777
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:01,930
- Master
- Fong.

778
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:06,443
Your body'll hold the Gold Buddha's energy

779
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:09,450
I'll send you above the clouds
to absorb the sun's rays

780
00:46:09,484 --> 00:46:11,952
Master, you'll bleed to death!

781
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:13,715
Concentrate!

782
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,864
Master, Master

783
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:26,389
Are you alright, Master!

784
00:46:26,434 --> 00:46:27,799
Let me go!

785
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:29,268
You'll die if you go up there!

786
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:31,828
If I don't, you'll all die

787
00:46:31,873 --> 00:46:35,001
Monk, if I don't come back

788
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:38,705
Please bury my urn of ashes properly for me

789
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:42,739
Lotus, we're all depending on you

790
00:46:43,985 --> 00:46:45,384
Lotus!

791
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,856
Lotus

792
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:52,319
We keep trying to be apart...

793
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,521
Yet we end up together!

794
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,527
But where we're going is not for you

795
00:46:57,565 --> 00:47:00,591
I know why I've to go, don't worry!

796
00:47:00,768 --> 00:47:01,894
What're you doing?

797
00:47:01,936 --> 00:47:04,404
I'm afraid I might let go of you

798
00:47:12,547 --> 00:47:14,378
Untie yourself!

799
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:16,574
If I let go, you'll fall down!

800
00:47:16,617 --> 00:47:18,448
Take care of yourself first!

801
00:47:47,714 --> 00:47:49,682
My eyes!

802
00:48:27,621 --> 00:48:28,781
The sun!

803
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:44,898
I'm out of breath!

804
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,695
Wow!
I fell so far, and I'm not hurt!

805
00:49:10,731 --> 00:49:12,426
Lotus

806
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,366
Hey, help me out!

807
00:49:14,402 --> 00:49:17,371
This is what I get for being kind!

808
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:21,737
Lotus... Lotus!

809
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:23,638
Lotus!

810
00:49:23,778 --> 00:49:25,473
Lotus!

811
00:49:26,414 --> 00:49:28,541
Lotus!

812
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:33,985
It's a shame your spirit is dispersed...

813
00:49:34,021 --> 00:49:36,546
Is this what one gets for being kind...

814
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:38,683
I hope good will come to you in the end

815
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,523
Fong

816
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:47,328
Lotus, Lotus

817
00:49:47,368 --> 00:49:50,303
I thought I'd never see you again!

818
00:49:51,806 --> 00:49:56,072
Take my urn of ashes with you,
and I'll leave here, too.

819
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:58,408
Who are you talking to?

820
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:03,607
All that is left is this red ribbon!

821
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:05,619
You mean her spirit dispersed?

822
00:50:05,653 --> 00:50:07,211
Yes!

823
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,731
I must go now, hope we meet again

824
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:26,068
We'll leave that to fate.
We've got to go too, bye for now

825
00:50:27,074 --> 00:50:29,235
Goodbye

826
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,180
Let's go, Master

827
00:50:35,316 --> 00:50:38,342
Fong, why're you walking so fast?

828
00:50:40,154 --> 00:50:42,679
I can't find Lotus's urn of ashes!

829
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,122
Really?

830
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:49,325
Lotus,
let's get to know each other better

831
00:50:52,066 --> 00:50:55,467
You reap what you sow,
stealing is wrong

832
00:50:55,503 --> 00:50:58,700
I put the ashes inside my gourd

833
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:00,666
Fong!

834
00:51:04,145 --> 00:51:05,806
Fong!

835
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:09,481
I'll find you wherever you're gone!

836
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:11,781
Fong, where are you taking me?

837
00:51:13,888 --> 00:51:17,551
The demon said there's no heaven...

838
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:19,115
Is that true?

839
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,559
Stop talking and do something...

840
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,118
Help me up!

841
00:51:22,163 --> 00:51:23,460
Sure!
