1
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,318
With the coming
of the Second World War...

2
00:01:26,657 --> 00:01:30,650
...many eyes in imprisoned Europe
turned hopefully, or desperately...

3
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:33,657
...toward the freedom of the Americas.

4
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:36,525
Lisbon became
the great embarkation point.

5
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:39,897
But not everybody could get
to Lisbon directly.

6
00:01:40,337 --> 00:01:44,000
And so a torturous, roundabout
refugee trail sprang up.

7
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,669
Paris to Marseilles...

8
00:01:52,683 --> 00:01:55,345
...across the Mediterranean to Oran.

9
00:02:02,693 --> 00:02:07,153
Then, by train or auto or foot,
across the rim of Africa...

10
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:09,855
...to Casablanca in French Morocco.

11
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:14,628
Here, the fortunate ones,
through money or influence or luck...

12
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:18,305
...might obtain exit visas
and scurry to Lisbon.

13
00:02:18,676 --> 00:02:20,906
And from Lisbon to the New World.

14
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,308
But the others wait in Casablanca.

15
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:28,474
And wait and wait...

16
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,449
...and wait.

17
00:02:40,097 --> 00:02:41,689
To all officers:

18
00:02:41,865 --> 00:02:46,734
Two German couriers carrying official
documents murdered on train from Oran.

19
00:02:46,937 --> 00:02:49,929
Murderer and possible accomplices
headed for Casablanca.

20
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,940
Round up all suspicious characters
and search them for stolen document.

21
00:02:54,378 --> 00:02:55,709
Important.

22
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:28,877
May we see your papers?

23
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:30,874
I don't think I have them on me.

24
00:03:31,081 --> 00:03:34,380
- In that case, you'll have to come along.
- Wait. It's possible that I...

25
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,644
Yes. Here they are.

26
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,725
These papers expired three weeks ago.
You'll have to come along.

27
00:03:42,926 --> 00:03:44,553
Halt!

28
00:03:45,295 --> 00:03:46,819
Halt!

29
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:14,452
- What on earth is going on there?
- I don't know, my dear.

30
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:17,125
Pardon, monsieur. Pardon, madame.
Have you not heard?

31
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:20,092
We hear very little,
and we understand even less.

32
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,926
Two German couriers were found murdered
in the desert. The unoccupied desert.

33
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,625
This is the customary roundup
of refugees, liberals...

34
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:30,433
...and, of course, a beautiful young girl
for Renault, the prefect of police.

35
00:04:35,112 --> 00:04:39,071
Along with these unhappy refugees, the scum
of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca.

36
00:04:39,283 --> 00:04:41,649
Some of them have been waiting
years for a visa.

37
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:45,117
I beg of you, monsieur, watch yourself.
Be on guard.

38
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:47,313
This place is full of vultures.

39
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:50,221
Vultures everywhere. Everywhere!

40
00:04:50,394 --> 00:04:52,862
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

41
00:04:55,032 --> 00:04:56,897
What an amusing little fellow.

42
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,397
Waiter.

43
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,802
- Oh, how silly of me.
- What, dear?

44
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,338
I've left my wallet in the hotel.

45
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,158
Perhaps tomorrow
we'll be on the plane.

46
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:51,578
It is good to see you again,
Major Strasser.

47
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:52,948
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,420
May I present Captain Renault,
police prefect of Casablanca. Major Strasser.

49
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,619
Unoccupied France welcomes you
to Casablanca.

50
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:01,794
Thank you, captain.
It's good to be here.

51
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:04,627
Major Strasser, my aide,
Lieutenant Casselle.

52
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:07,269
Captain Tonnelli.
The Italian service at your command.

53
00:06:07,437 --> 00:06:08,631
That is kind of you.

54
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:17,945
You may find the climate
of Casablanca a trifle warm.

55
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:21,778
We Germans must get used to all climates,
from Russia to the Sahara.

56
00:06:22,119 --> 00:06:25,054
- Perhaps you weren't referring to weather.
- What else?

57
00:06:25,222 --> 00:06:27,486
The murder of the couriers.
What has been done?

58
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,458
My men are rounding up
twice the usual number of suspects.

59
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:34,654
- But we know already who the murderer is.
- Good. Is he in custody?

60
00:06:34,865 --> 00:06:37,800
No hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's.
Everybody comes to Rick's.

61
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,460
I've already heard about this café.
And also about Mr. Rick himself.

62
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:39,220
Waiting, waiting, waiting.

63
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:41,420
I'll never get out of here.

64
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,665
I'll die in Casablanca.

65
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:46,097
But can't you make it just a little more?

66
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:47,258
Please?

67
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:50,872
Sorry, but diamonds are a drug
on the market. Everybody sells diamonds.

68
00:07:51,074 --> 00:07:53,304
There are diamonds everywhere. 2400.

69
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,636
All right.

70
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,780
The trucks are waiting.
The men are waiting. Everything--

71
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:03,710
It's the fishing smack Santiago.

72
00:08:03,887 --> 00:08:08,290
It leaves at 1 tomorrow night,
here from the end of La Medina. Third boat.

73
00:08:08,492 --> 00:08:11,757
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And bring 15,000 francs in cash.

74
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,226
Remember, in cash.

75
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,097
Cheerio.

76
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:25,804
- Open up, Abdul.
- Yes, professor.

77
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:36,547
- Waiter?
- Yes, madame?

78
00:08:36,753 --> 00:08:39,415
Will you ask Rick
if he'll have a drink with us?

79
00:08:39,756 --> 00:08:43,089
Madame, he never drinks with customers.
Never. I have never seen it.

80
00:08:43,927 --> 00:08:46,122
What makes saloonkeepers so snobbish?

81
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:50,163
Perhaps if you told him I ran the
second-largest banking house in Amsterdam.

82
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:52,995
Second largest?
That wouldn't impress Rick.

83
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,731
The leading banker in Amsterdam
is now the pastry chef in our kitchen.

84
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,431
We have something
to look forward to.

85
00:09:00,744 --> 00:09:02,939
And his father is the bellboy.

86
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,142
Excuse me.

87
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,775
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a private room.

88
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:42,574
Of all the nerve. Who do you think--?
I know there is gambling in there.

89
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:45,881
- You dare not keep me out.
- Yes? What's the trouble?

90
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:49,081
I have been in every gambling room
between Honolulu and Berlin.

91
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,319
And if you think I'm going to be kept out
of a saloon like this, you're much mistaken.

92
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,464
Excuse me, please.
Hello, Rick.

93
00:09:58,135 --> 00:09:59,932
Your cash is good at the bar.

94
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,101
What? Do you know who I am?

95
00:10:02,305 --> 00:10:04,273
I do. You're lucky the bar is open to you.

96
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:07,443
This is outrageous!
I shall report it to The Angriff.

97
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,774
You know, watching you just now, one would
think you've been doing this all your life.

98
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,784
- What makes you think I haven't?
- Nothing.

99
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:21,947
- But when you first came, I thought--
- You thought what?

100
00:10:22,392 --> 00:10:24,622
What right do I have to think?

101
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:30,927
May I?

102
00:10:32,068 --> 00:10:34,628
Too bad about those two
German couriers, wasn't it?

103
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:37,467
They got a lucky break.
Yesterday they were just clerks...

104
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,905
...today they are the honored dead.

105
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,968
You are a very cynical person, Rick,
if you'll forgive me for saying so.

106
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,273
I forgive you.

107
00:10:45,482 --> 00:10:47,143
- Will you have a drink with me?
- No.

108
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,319
I forgot, you never drink with--
I'll have another, please.

109
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,983
You despise me, don't you?

110
00:10:53,323 --> 00:10:55,348
If I gave you any thought,
I probably would.

111
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,856
But why?

112
00:10:57,727 --> 00:10:59,957
Do you object to the kind of business I do?

113
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:05,124
But think of all those poor refugees who
must rot in this place if I didn't help them.

114
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:09,897
That's not so bad. Through ways of my own,
I provide them with exit visas.

115
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:12,336
For a price, Ugarte. For a price.

116
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:16,903
But think of all the poor devils
who can't meet Renault's price.

117
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,514
I get it for them for half.
Is that so parasitic?

118
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:24,279
I don't mind a parasite.
I object to a cut-rate one.

119
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,855
Well, after tonight I will be through
with the whole business.

120
00:11:28,024 --> 00:11:30,720
And I'm leaving, finally,
this Casablanca.

121
00:11:30,894 --> 00:11:33,954
Who did you bribe for your visa?
Renault or yourself?

122
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:37,630
Myself.
I found myself much more reasonable.

123
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:39,158
Look, Rick.

124
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:41,503
Know what this is?

125
00:11:41,972 --> 00:11:44,805
Something that even you have never seen.

126
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:48,136
Letters of transit signed
by General de Gaulle.

127
00:11:48,378 --> 00:11:51,643
Cannot be rescinded.
Not even questioned.

128
00:11:51,815 --> 00:11:52,804
One moment.

129
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:56,281
Tonight I'll be selling those
for more money than I ever dreamed of.

130
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:59,286
And then, addio, Casablanca.

131
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,785
I have many a friend in Casablanca,
but somehow, just because you despise me...

132
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,427
...you are the only one I trust.

133
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,492
Will you keep these for me, please?

134
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:10,461
- For how long?
- Perhaps an hour. Perhaps a little longer.

135
00:12:10,634 --> 00:12:13,398
- I don't want them here overnight.
- Don't be afraid of that.

136
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,162
Please keep them for me.

137
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:17,533
Thank you.
I knew I could trust you.

138
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:20,042
Waiter. I'll be expecting some people.

139
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,111
If anybody asks for me,
I'll be right here.

140
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:25,336
Rick...

141
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:27,641
...I hope you're more impressed
with me now.

142
00:12:28,985 --> 00:12:32,250
If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck
with your roulette wheel.

143
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:33,514
Just a moment.

144
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:39,722
I heard a rumor those two German couriers
were carrying letters of transit.

145
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:45,998
I've heard that rumor too. Poor devils.

146
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:50,161
You're right, Ugarte.
I am a little more impressed with you.

147
00:14:11,588 --> 00:14:13,021
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Ferrari.

148
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,816
How's business at the Blue Parrot?

149
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:17,516
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
- It's not for sale.

150
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,924
- You haven't heard my offer.
- It's not for sale at any price.

151
00:14:21,097 --> 00:14:24,658
- What do you want for Sam?
- I don't buy or sell human beings.

152
00:14:24,868 --> 00:14:26,995
Too bad.
That's Casablanca's leading commodity.

153
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:31,264
In refugees alone we could make a fortune,
if you'd work with me in the black market.

154
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:33,841
Suppose you run your business
and let me run mine.

155
00:14:34,644 --> 00:14:37,112
Suppose we ask Sam.
Maybe he'd like to make a change.

156
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,372
Suppose we do.

157
00:14:38,548 --> 00:14:43,508
When will you realize that in this world today
isolationism is no longer a practical policy?

158
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:46,449
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him
at the Blue Parrot.

159
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:47,715
Oh, I like it fine here.

160
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:51,792
- He'll double what I pay you.
- I ain't got time to spend what I make here.

161
00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:54,256
Sorry.

162
00:14:57,634 --> 00:14:59,431
The boss's private stock...

163
00:14:59,602 --> 00:15:02,036
- ...because, Yvonne, I love you.
- Oh, shut up.

164
00:15:02,238 --> 00:15:06,231
All right, all right. For you, I shut up,
because, Yvonne, I love you.

165
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:13,576
Some Germans gave this check.
Is it all right?

166
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:20,084
Where were you last night?

167
00:15:20,256 --> 00:15:22,520
That's so long ago,
I don't remember.

168
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:26,192
- Will I see you tonight?
- I never make plans that far ahead.

169
00:15:27,497 --> 00:15:28,725
Give me another.

170
00:15:28,898 --> 00:15:31,662
- Sascha, she's had enough.
- Don't listen to him. Fill it up.

171
00:15:31,835 --> 00:15:34,030
Yvonne, I love you,
but he pays me.

172
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:36,728
- Rick, I'm tired of having you--
- Sascha, call a cab.

173
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:39,306
- We're gonna get your coat.
- Take your hands off me.

174
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:42,036
You're going home.
You've had a little too much to drink.

175
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:46,482
Hey, taxi.

176
00:15:47,217 --> 00:15:49,344
Who do you think you are,
pushing me around?

177
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,282
I was a fool
to fall for a man like you.

178
00:15:51,454 --> 00:15:53,479
Go with her, Sascha.
Be sure she gets home.

179
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:54,645
And come right back.

180
00:15:54,858 --> 00:15:56,325
Yes, boss.

181
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:09,765
- Hello, Rick.
- Hello, Louis.

182
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,237
How extravagant you are,
throwing away women.

183
00:16:12,442 --> 00:16:14,137
Someday they may be scarce.

184
00:16:14,644 --> 00:16:16,578
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne.

185
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,371
Maybe get her on the rebound.

186
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,675
When it comes to women,
you're a true democrat.

187
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,952
If he gets a word in,
it'll be a major Italian victory.

188
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,962
The plane to Lisbon.

189
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,438
You would like to be on it?

190
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:48,304
Why? What's in Lisbon?

191
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,545
The clipper to America.

192
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:53,443
I've often speculated on why
you don't return to America.

193
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,586
Did you abscond with the church funds?
Did you run off with a senator's wife?

194
00:16:57,987 --> 00:17:00,649
I like to think you killed a man.
It's the romantic in me.

195
00:17:00,857 --> 00:17:02,518
It's a combination of all three.

196
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:05,159
And what in heaven's name
brought you to Casablanca?

197
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,796
My health.
I came to Casablanca for the waters.

198
00:17:08,097 --> 00:17:11,260
The waters? What waters?
We're in the desert.

199
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,665
I was misinformed.

200
00:17:16,272 --> 00:17:17,603
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick.

201
00:17:17,774 --> 00:17:20,607
A gentleman inside
has won 20,000 francs...

202
00:17:20,977 --> 00:17:23,172
...and the cashier
would like some money.

203
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:25,776
I'll get it from the safe.

204
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:27,507
I'm so upset, Rick. You know I--

205
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:30,311
Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that
happen all the time.

206
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,283
I'm awfully sorry.

207
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,523
Rick, there will be some excitement
here tonight. An arrest in your café.

208
00:17:41,698 --> 00:17:43,427
- Again?
- This is no ordinary arrest.

209
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:44,998
A murderer, no less.

210
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:49,230
If you're thinking of warning him,
don't put yourself out. He cannot escape.

211
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:53,239
- I stick my neck out for nobody.
- A wise foreign policy.

212
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,505
Could have made the arrest earlier,
at the Blue Parrot.

213
00:17:59,682 --> 00:18:01,809
Out of my regard for you,
we're staging it here.

214
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:03,475
It will amuse your customers.

215
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:06,146
Our entertainment's enough.

216
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:08,782
We're to have an important guest
here tonight.

217
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:11,483
Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less.

218
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:13,822
We want him to be here
when we make the arrest.

219
00:18:13,997 --> 00:18:16,557
A demonstration of the efficiency
of my administration.

220
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,667
I see.
And what's Strasser doing here?

221
00:18:18,868 --> 00:18:22,770
He certainly didn't come here to witness
a demonstration of your efficiency.

222
00:18:22,972 --> 00:18:24,064
- Perhaps not.
- Here.

223
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:26,367
- It shall not happen again.
- That's all right.

224
00:18:26,576 --> 00:18:29,409
Louis, you got something on your mind.
Why don't you spill it.

225
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,102
How observant you are.

226
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,143
As a matter of fact,
I wanted to give you a word of advice.

227
00:18:34,317 --> 00:18:35,306
Yeah?

228
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:37,882
- Have a brandy?
- Thank you.

229
00:18:39,022 --> 00:18:43,015
There are many exit visas sold in this café,
but we know that you've never sold one.

230
00:18:43,526 --> 00:18:45,687
That is the reason
we permit you to remain open.

231
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:48,160
I thought it was because
I let you win at roulette.

232
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,559
That is another reason.

233
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:52,530
There is a man arrived in Casablanca
on his way to America.

234
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:55,602
He will offer a fortune to anyone
who'll furnish an exit visa.

235
00:18:55,805 --> 00:18:58,296
- What's his name?
- Victor Laszlo.

236
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:00,074
Victor Laszlo?

237
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:02,837
Rick, that is the first time
I've seen you so impressed.

238
00:19:03,012 --> 00:19:05,003
He's succeeded in impressing
half the world.

239
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,639
It's my duty to see that
he doesn't impress the other half.

240
00:19:08,818 --> 00:19:11,787
Laszlo must never reach America.
He stays in Casablanca.

241
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:14,056
It'll be interesting
to see how he manages.

242
00:19:14,257 --> 00:19:16,384
- Manages what?
- His escape.

243
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:18,457
- But I just told you--
- Stop it.

244
00:19:18,628 --> 00:19:22,291
He escaped from a concentration camp.
The Nazis have chased him all over Europe.

245
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,796
This is the end of the chase.

246
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,594
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.

247
00:19:26,836 --> 00:19:28,133
Is that a serious offer?

248
00:19:28,504 --> 00:19:30,665
I just paid out 20,
and I'd like to get it back.

249
00:19:31,007 --> 00:19:33,669
Make it 10.
I'm only a poor corrupt official.

250
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,671
- Okay.
- Done.

251
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:39,871
No matter how clever he is, he still
needs an exit visa. Or I should say two.

252
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,375
- Why two?
- He is traveling with a lady.

253
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:45,281
- He'll take one.
- I think not. I've seen the lady.

254
00:19:45,588 --> 00:19:48,216
And if he did not leave her
in Marseilles or Oran...

255
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:50,851
...he certainly won't leave her
in Casablanca.

256
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,187
Maybe he's not quite
as romantic as you are.

257
00:19:53,396 --> 00:19:56,627
It doesn't matter.
There is no exit visa for him.

258
00:19:57,266 --> 00:20:00,861
What ever gave you the impression
that I might help Laszlo escape?

259
00:20:01,237 --> 00:20:04,400
Because, my dear Ricky,
I suspect that under that cynical shell...

260
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:06,303
...you are at heart a sentimentalist.

261
00:20:06,943 --> 00:20:09,878
Laugh if you will,
but I happen to be familiar with your record.

262
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,206
Let me point out just two items:

263
00:20:12,548 --> 00:20:16,541
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.

264
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:20,621
In 1936, you fought in Spain
on the Loyalist side.

265
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:23,121
And got well paid for it on both occasions.

266
00:20:23,326 --> 00:20:25,624
The winning side would
have paid you much better.

267
00:20:26,062 --> 00:20:27,051
Maybe.

268
00:20:28,097 --> 00:20:30,292
It seems you're determined
to keep Laszlo here.

269
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,263
I have my orders.

270
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,900
I see. Gestapo spank.

271
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,902
My dear Ricky, you overestimate
the influence of the Gestapo.

272
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:41,440
I don't interfere with them,
and they don't interfere with me.

273
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,737
In Casablanca, I am master of my fate.

274
00:20:43,913 --> 00:20:46,040
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here, sir.

275
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:48,445
- You were saying?
- Excuse me.

276
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:01,458
Carl, see that Major Strasser
gets a good table, close to the ladies.

277
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:06,260
I have already given him the best, knowing
he is German and would take it anyway.

278
00:21:08,404 --> 00:21:11,601
Take him quietly.
Two guards at every door.

279
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,537
- Everything is ready, sir.
- Go ahead.

280
00:21:24,253 --> 00:21:26,585
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, captain.

281
00:21:26,756 --> 00:21:28,781
- Won't you join us?
- Thank you.

282
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:33,590
- It's a pleasure to have you here, major.
- Champagne and a tin of caviar.

283
00:21:33,796 --> 00:21:37,163
May I recommend Veuve Clicquot '26,
a good French wine.

284
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,324
Very well, sir.

285
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:42,833
- A very interesting club.
- Especially so tonight, major.

286
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,634
In a few minutes you'll see the arrest
of the man who murdered your couriers.

287
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:48,333
I expected no less, captain.

288
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:50,136
Monsieur Ugarte.

289
00:21:53,182 --> 00:21:55,548
- Will you please come with us?
- Certainly.

290
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:58,784
May I first please cash my chips?

291
00:22:05,895 --> 00:22:08,557
Very lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.

292
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,387
Rick! Rick, help me!

293
00:22:32,622 --> 00:22:36,683
- Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
- But, Rick, hide me. Do something!

294
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:45,664
Excellent, captain.

295
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:48,496
When they come for me,
I hope you'll be more of a help.

296
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,764
I stick my neck out for nobody.

297
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,806
I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks,
but it's all over now.

298
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:58,538
Just sit down and have a good time.
Enjoy yourselves. All right, Sam.

299
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:09,813
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser
of the Third Reich.

300
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:11,892
- How do you do, Mr. Rick?
- How do you do?

301
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:14,188
You already know Herr Heinze
of the Third Reich.

302
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,865
Please join us, Mr. Rick.

303
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:22,027
We are very honored tonight.

304
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:26,368
Major Strasser is one of the reasons
the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has.

305
00:23:26,542 --> 00:23:29,511
You repeat Third Reich
as though you expected there to be others.

306
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:32,306
Well, personally, major,
I will take what comes.

307
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,508
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

308
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:38,278
- Unofficially, of course.
- Make it official if you like.

309
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:41,048
- What is your nationality?
- I'm a drunkard.

310
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:44,683
And that makes Rick a citizen
of the world.

311
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:47,519
I was born in New York City,
if that'll help you any.

312
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:51,227
I understand you came here from Paris
at the time of the occupation.

313
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,163
There seems to be no secret about that.

314
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:57,533
Are you one of those people who cannot
imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?

315
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:59,937
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.

316
00:24:00,142 --> 00:24:02,007
Can you imagine us in London?

317
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:04,635
When you get there, ask me.

318
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:06,274
Diplomatist.

319
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:07,609
How about New York?

320
00:24:07,783 --> 00:24:12,652
Well, there are sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.

321
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:16,056
- Who do you think will win the war?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

322
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:20,889
Rick is completely neutral about everything.
And that takes in the field of women too.

323
00:24:21,097 --> 00:24:25,363
You were not always so carefully neutral.
We have a complete dossier on you.

324
00:24:27,103 --> 00:24:31,369
"Richard Blaine, American. Age: 37.
Cannot return to his country."

325
00:24:32,141 --> 00:24:35,133
The reason is a little vague.
We also know what you did in Paris.

326
00:24:35,311 --> 00:24:39,042
And also we know why you left Paris.
Don't worry, we're not going to broadcast it.

327
00:24:39,215 --> 00:24:40,443
Are my eyes really brown?

328
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:43,847
You will forgive my curiosity,
Mr. Blaine. The point is...

329
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,250
...an enemy of the Reich
has come to Casablanca...

330
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:49,414
...and we are checking up on anybody
who can be of any help to us.

331
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:53,652
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo
stays or goes is purely a sporting one.

332
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:57,591
In this case you have no sympathy
for the fox?

333
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,258
Not particularly. I understand
the point of view of the hound too.

334
00:25:01,537 --> 00:25:04,438
Laszlo published the foulest lies
in the Prague newspapers...

335
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:06,199
...until the day we marched in.

336
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:10,709
And even after that, he continued
to print scandal sheets in his cellar.

337
00:25:10,913 --> 00:25:13,575
Of course, one must admit
he has great courage.

338
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:16,975
I admit he's clever.
Three times he slipped through our fingers.

339
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:21,089
In Paris he continued his activities.
We intend not to let it happen again.

340
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:24,715
Excuse me, gentlemen. Your business
is politics, mine is running a saloon.

341
00:25:24,927 --> 00:25:26,758
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.

342
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,921
You see, major?
You have nothing to worry about Rick.

343
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:31,665
Perhaps.

344
00:25:36,906 --> 00:25:40,774
- I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
- Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.

345
00:26:07,937 --> 00:26:09,666
Two Cointreaux, please.

346
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:14,174
I saw no one of Ugarte's description.

347
00:26:14,443 --> 00:26:17,469
Victor, I feel somehow
we shouldn't stay here.

348
00:26:17,646 --> 00:26:20,581
If we would walk out so soon
it would only call attention to us.

349
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,947
Perhaps Ugarte is in
some other part of the café.

350
00:26:24,754 --> 00:26:28,451
Excuse me, but you look like a couple
who are on their way to America.

351
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:33,158
You'll find a market there for this ring.
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.

352
00:26:33,362 --> 00:26:35,853
- Thank you, but I hardly think...
- Perhaps for the lady.

353
00:26:36,065 --> 00:26:37,532
The ring is quite unique.

354
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:43,331
- Yes, I'm very interested.
- Good.

355
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,930
What is your name?

356
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:47,405
Berger, Norwegian.
At your service, sir.

357
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:51,172
I'll meet you in a few minutes
at the bar.

358
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,940
We don't want the ring,
but thanks for showing it to us.

359
00:26:54,116 --> 00:26:57,176
- Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
- I'm sorry, it is.

360
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:02,116
- Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
- Yes?

361
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:04,315
I am Captain Renault,
prefect of police.

362
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:05,653
Yes, what is it you want?

363
00:27:05,861 --> 00:27:08,955
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca
and wish you a pleasant stay.

364
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:11,861
It isn't often we have
so distinguished a visitor.

365
00:27:12,067 --> 00:27:14,501
Thank you.
I hope you'll forgive me, captain.

366
00:27:14,703 --> 00:27:18,195
The present French administration
hasn't always been so cordial.

367
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:20,272
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund.

368
00:27:22,044 --> 00:27:24,945
I was told you were the most
beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca.

369
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:26,911
That was a gross understatement.

370
00:27:27,383 --> 00:27:28,407
You're very kind.

371
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:31,108
- Won't you join us?
- If you will permit me.

372
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,048
Oh, no, Emile, please. A bottle of your
best champagne. And put it on my bill.

373
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:40,594
It's a game we play. They put it on the bill,
I tear up the bill. It is very convenient.

374
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,528
Captain,
the boy who's playing the piano...

375
00:27:45,201 --> 00:27:46,668
Somewhere I've seen him.

376
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,393
- Sam?
- Yes.

377
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:50,300
He came from Paris with Rick.

378
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,939
Rick? Who is he?

379
00:27:52,107 --> 00:27:55,508
- Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's. Rick is...
- Is what?

380
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,976
Mademoiselle, he's the kind of man that,
well, if I were a woman...

381
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:01,877
...and I were not around,
I should be in love with Rick.

382
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:05,611
But what a fool I am talking
to a beautiful woman about another man.

383
00:28:07,056 --> 00:28:08,080
Excuse me.

384
00:28:08,257 --> 00:28:10,088
Major.

385
00:28:11,627 --> 00:28:14,755
Mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo,
may I present Major Strasser.

386
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,954
How do you do?

387
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:18,122
This is a pleasure
I have looked forward to.

388
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:20,859
I'm sure you'll excuse me
if I'm not gracious.

389
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:23,163
You see, Major Strasser,
I am a Czechoslovakian.

390
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:27,466
You were a Czechoslovakian.
Now you are a subject of the German Reich.

391
00:28:28,644 --> 00:28:32,102
I have never accepted that privilege.
And I'm now on French soil.

392
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:36,080
I should like to discuss some matters arising
from your presence on French soil.

393
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:37,879
This is hardly the time or place.

394
00:28:38,087 --> 00:28:42,490
Then we shall state another time and place.
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office.

395
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,919
With mademoiselle.

396
00:28:45,561 --> 00:28:48,621
Captain, I am under your authority.

397
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:50,856
Is it your order
that we come to your office?

398
00:28:51,066 --> 00:28:54,934
Let us say it is my request.
That is a much more pleasant word.

399
00:28:55,137 --> 00:28:56,434
Very well.

400
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:03,669
A very clever tactical retreat, major.

401
00:29:04,113 --> 00:29:07,947
- This time they really mean to stop me.
- Victor, I'm afraid for you.

402
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,012
We've been in difficult places before,
haven't we?

403
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,254
I must find out what Berger knows.

404
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:49,652
- Be careful.
- I will. Don't worry.

405
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:10,171
Monsieur Berger, the ring.
Could I see it again?

406
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,337
Champagne cocktail, please.

407
00:30:13,182 --> 00:30:15,912
I recognize you from the news photographs,
Monsieur Laszlo.

408
00:30:16,085 --> 00:30:19,054
In a concentration camp,
one is apt to lose a little weight.

409
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:22,213
We read five times that you were killed
in five different places.

410
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:25,257
As you see,
it was true every single time.

411
00:30:25,461 --> 00:30:26,985
Thank heaven I found you, Berger.

412
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:30,689
I'm looking for a man by the name of Ugarte.
He's supposed to help me.

413
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,631
Ugarte cannot even help himself.

414
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:38,034
He's under arrest for murder.
He was arrested here tonight.

415
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,766
I see.

416
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:44,302
But we who are still free will do
all we can. We are organized.

417
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:46,708
Underground, like everywhere else.

418
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:49,713
Tomorrow night there is a meeting
at the Caverne du Bois.

419
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,712
If you will come--

420
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:07,566
Will you ask the piano player
to come over here?

421
00:31:07,736 --> 00:31:09,863
Very well, mademoiselle.

422
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:15,340
- How's the jewelry business, Berger?
- Not so good. Check, please.

423
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:19,675
Too bad you weren't here earlier. We had
quite a bit of excitement, didn't we, Berger?

424
00:31:19,948 --> 00:31:21,415
Yes. Excuse me, gentlemen.

425
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:25,019
- My bill.
- No. Two champagne cocktails. Please.

426
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:31,989
- Hello, Sam.
- Hello, Miss Ilsa.

427
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,685
I never expected to see you again.

428
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,994
It's been a long time.

429
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:40,191
Yes, ma'am.
A lot of water under the bridge.

430
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,038
- Some of the old songs, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:56,139
Where is Rick?

432
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,219
I don't know.
I ain't seen him all night.

433
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:03,622
- When will he be back?
- Not tonight no more. He ain't coming--

434
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:05,521
He went home.

435
00:32:07,062 --> 00:32:09,895
- Does he always leave so early?
- He never--

436
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:12,465
Well, he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot.

437
00:32:12,668 --> 00:32:14,761
Goes up there all the time.

438
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:19,000
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

439
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:23,173
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa.
You're bad luck to him.

440
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:29,107
Play it once, Sam.
For old times' sake.

441
00:32:29,284 --> 00:32:31,650
I don't know what you mean,
Miss Ilsa.

442
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:33,778
Play it, Sam.

443
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,781
Play "As Time Goes By."

444
00:32:37,192 --> 00:32:40,320
I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa.
I'm a little rusty on it.

445
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:43,221
I'll hum it for you.

446
00:32:54,877 --> 00:32:56,276
Sing it, Sam.

447
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:45,188
Sam, I thought I told you never to play--

448
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:58,806
Well, you were asking about Rick,
and here he is. May I present--

449
00:33:59,007 --> 00:34:01,305
- Hello, Ilsa.
- Hello, Rick.

450
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,002
Oh, you've already met Rick, mademoiselle?
Then perhaps you also--

451
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:06,545
This is Mr. Laszlo.

452
00:34:06,748 --> 00:34:08,113
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

453
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:10,576
One hears a great deal about Rick
in Casablanca.

454
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,750
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.

455
00:34:12,955 --> 00:34:15,082
- Won't you join us for a drink?
- Rick never--

456
00:34:15,257 --> 00:34:17,122
- Thanks, I will.
- Well...

457
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:20,227
...a precedent is being broken. Emile.

458
00:34:21,029 --> 00:34:24,521
- Interesting café. I congratulate you.
- I congratulate you.

459
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,224
- What for?
- Your work.

460
00:34:26,401 --> 00:34:28,096
Thank you. I try.

461
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:30,904
We all try. You succeed.

462
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:35,974
She was asking about you earlier, Rick,
in a way that made me extremely jealous.

463
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:38,369
I wasn't sure you were the same.

464
00:34:39,114 --> 00:34:41,981
- Let's see, the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore.

465
00:34:43,552 --> 00:34:45,486
How nice. You remembered.

466
00:34:45,654 --> 00:34:48,452
But, of course, that was the day
the Germans marched into Paris.

467
00:34:48,657 --> 00:34:50,818
Not an easy day to forget.

468
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:55,324
I remember every detail.
The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

469
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:59,326
Yes. I put that dress away.

470
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,866
When the Germans march out
I'll wear it again.

471
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:06,166
Ricky, you're becoming quite human.
I suppose we have to thank you for that.

472
00:35:06,575 --> 00:35:09,806
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one
to say it, but it's late.

473
00:35:10,012 --> 00:35:14,073
So it is. We have a curfew in Casablanca.
It would never do for the chief of police...

474
00:35:14,283 --> 00:35:16,274
...to be found drinking after hours.

475
00:35:17,052 --> 00:35:19,384
- I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
- Not at all.

476
00:35:19,688 --> 00:35:21,280
- Your check, sir.
- It's my party.

477
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:25,051
Another precedent gone.
This has been a very interesting evening.

478
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,196
I'll call you a cab.
Gasoline rationing, time of night.

479
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,093
- We'll come again.
- Anytime.

480
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,359
- Say good night to Sam for me.
- I will.

481
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:38,363
There's still nobody in the world
who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.

482
00:35:38,907 --> 00:35:41,375
He hasn't played it in a long time.

483
00:35:42,878 --> 00:35:44,846
- Good night.
- Good night.

484
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:46,640
Night.

485
00:35:54,523 --> 00:35:57,014
A very puzzling fellow, this Rick.
What sort is he?

486
00:35:57,225 --> 00:36:00,422
I really can't say,
though I saw him quite often in Paris.

487
00:36:00,629 --> 00:36:03,189
- Tomorrow at 10, at the prefect office.
- We'll be there.

488
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:05,060
- Good night.
- Good night.

489
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,429
Boss?

490
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:51,011
- Boss?
- Yeah?

491
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:54,573
- Boss, ain't you going to bed?
- Not right now.

492
00:36:54,783 --> 00:36:57,718
Ain't you planning on going to bed
in the near future?

493
00:36:57,986 --> 00:37:00,045
- You ever going to bed?
- No.

494
00:37:00,856 --> 00:37:02,687
Well, I ain't sleepy, either.

495
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:04,051
Good, then have a drink.

496
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:06,193
- Not me, boss.
- Then don't have a drink.

497
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:07,919
Boss, let's get out of here.

498
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,655
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.

499
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:13,426
Please, let's go.
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.

500
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:15,603
She's coming back.
I know she's coming back.

501
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:17,466
We'll take the car and drive all night.

502
00:37:17,672 --> 00:37:20,505
We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing,
stay away until she's gone.

503
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:25,044
- Shut up and go home, will you?
- No, sir, I'm staying right here.

504
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:33,077
They grab Ugarte, then she walks in.

505
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:36,983
That's the way it goes.
One in, one out.

506
00:37:38,126 --> 00:37:40,219
- Sam.
- Yes, boss?

507
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:44,859
If it's December 1941 in Casablanca,
what time is it in New York?

508
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,492
What?

509
00:37:46,868 --> 00:37:48,358
My watch stopped.

510
00:37:49,171 --> 00:37:51,366
I bet they're asleep in New York.

511
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:54,303
I bet they're asleep all over America.

512
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:05,280
Of all the gin joints in all the towns
in all the world...

513
00:38:05,454 --> 00:38:07,479
...she walks into mine.

514
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:17,660
- What's that you're playing?
- A little something of my own.

515
00:38:17,833 --> 00:38:20,631
- Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
- No, I don't.

516
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:22,929
You played it for her.
You can play it for me.

517
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:26,301
- I don't think I can remember--
- If she can stand it, I can.

518
00:38:26,508 --> 00:38:27,532
Play it.

519
00:38:28,643 --> 00:38:30,008
Yes, boss.

520
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,497
Who are you really?
And what were you before?

521
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:04,829
What did you do,
and what did you think?

522
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,341
We said no questions.

523
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:14,038
Here's looking at you, kid.

524
00:40:48,016 --> 00:40:49,745
A franc for your thoughts.

525
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,351
In America they'd bring only a penny.

526
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,755
I guess that's about all they're worth.

527
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,587
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.

528
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:02,022
Well, I was wondering...

529
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:08,234
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should
find you waiting for me to come along.

530
00:41:09,337 --> 00:41:11,532
Why there is no other man in my life?

531
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,105
That's easy.
There was.

532
00:41:18,113 --> 00:41:19,637
He's dead.

533
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,448
I'm sorry for asking.

534
00:41:23,118 --> 00:41:25,518
I forgot we said no questions.

535
00:41:29,257 --> 00:41:33,023
Only one answer can take care
of all our questions.

536
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:21,766
Nothing can stop them now. Wednesday,
Thursday at the latest, they'll be in Paris.

537
00:42:21,943 --> 00:42:24,878
Richard, they'll find out your record.
You won't be safe here.

538
00:42:25,046 --> 00:42:28,504
I'm on their blacklist already.
Their roll of honor.

539
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:16,656
Henri wants us to finish this bottle
and then three more.

540
00:43:16,831 --> 00:43:20,631
Says he'll water his garden with champagne
before he'll let the Germans drink it.

541
00:43:20,835 --> 00:43:24,100
This sort of takes the sting out
of being occupied, doesn't it?

542
00:43:24,305 --> 00:43:25,533
You said it.

543
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:27,674
Here's looking at you, kid.

544
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:56,961
My German's a little rusty.

545
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,831
It's the Gestapo.

546
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:04,574
They say they expect to be
in Paris tomorrow.

547
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,238
They're telling us how to act
when they come marching in.

548
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,512
With the whole world crumbling,
we pick this time to fall in love.

549
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:17,350
It's pretty bad timing.

550
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:21,288
- Where were you, say, 10 years ago?
- 10 years ago?

551
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:24,364
Let's see.

552
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:28,501
Yes, I was having a brace put on my teeth.
Where were you?

553
00:44:29,137 --> 00:44:30,661
Looking for a job.

554
00:44:37,312 --> 00:44:38,870
Was that cannon fire?

555
00:44:39,881 --> 00:44:41,280
Or is it my heart pounding?

556
00:44:41,482 --> 00:44:45,543
It's the new German 77th, and judging
by the sound, only about 35 miles away.

557
00:44:47,856 --> 00:44:50,017
And getting closer every minute.

558
00:44:51,192 --> 00:44:52,318
Here, here, drink up.

559
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:54,890
We'll never finish the other three.

560
00:44:55,096 --> 00:44:58,532
Them Germans will be here pretty soon,
and they'll come looking for you.

561
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,827
And don't forget,
there's a price on your head.

562
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:04,028
I left a note in my apartment.
They'll know where to find me.

563
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:05,836
It's strange.

564
00:45:06,574 --> 00:45:10,442
- I know so very little about you.
- I know very little about you.

565
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:12,978
Just the fact that
you had your teeth straightened.

566
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:17,149
Be serious, darling. You are in danger.
You must leave Paris.

567
00:45:17,352 --> 00:45:18,478
No, we must leave.

568
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:20,887
Yes, of course. We.

569
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:24,820
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00.
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30.

570
00:45:26,227 --> 00:45:28,024
Not at my hotel. I...

571
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:31,793
I have things to do in the city
before I leave.

572
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,027
I'll meet you at the station.

573
00:45:34,302 --> 00:45:36,429
All right, at a quarter to 5.

574
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:38,502
Why don't we get married
in Marseilles?

575
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:44,872
That's too far ahead to plan.

576
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,843
Yes. I guess it is too far ahead.

577
00:45:48,149 --> 00:45:51,710
Let's see... What about the engineer?
Why can't he marry us on the train?

578
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:55,883
Why not? The captain on a ship can.
It doesn't seem fair that--

579
00:45:58,192 --> 00:45:59,318
Hey, what's wrong, kid?

580
00:46:05,867 --> 00:46:07,562
I love you so much.

581
00:46:10,238 --> 00:46:12,729
And I hate this war so much.

582
00:46:14,676 --> 00:46:17,406
It's a crazy world.
Anything can happen.

583
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:21,015
If you shouldn't get away...

584
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,116
If something should keep us apart...

585
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,920
...wherever they put you...

586
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:31,354
...and wherever I'll be,
I want you to know that I...

587
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:38,193
Kiss me.

588
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:41,534
Kiss me as if it were the last time.

589
00:47:17,538 --> 00:47:19,005
Where is she?
Have you seen her?

590
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,698
I can't find her.
She checked out of the hotel.

591
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,002
But this note came just after you left.

592
00:47:39,127 --> 00:47:40,822
That's the last call, Mr. Richard.

593
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:43,086
Do you hear me?

594
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:46,733
Come on, Mr. Richard.
Let's get out of here. Come on.

595
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:40,182
Rick, I have to talk to you.

596
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:44,888
I saved my first drink
to have with you. Here.

597
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:48,187
- No, Rick. Not tonight.
- Especially tonight.

598
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:53,191
Why did you have to come to Casablanca?
There are other places.

599
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:55,767
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known you were here.

600
00:48:56,504 --> 00:48:58,472
Believe me, Rick, it's true.
I didn't know.

601
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:02,040
It's funny about your voice,
how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it.

602
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:04,303
"Richard, dear,
I'll go with you anyplace.

603
00:49:04,779 --> 00:49:08,146
- We'll get on a train and never stop."
- Don't, Rick.

604
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,847
I can understand how you feel.

605
00:49:11,719 --> 00:49:13,846
You understand how I feel.

606
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,318
How long was it we had, honey?

607
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,452
- I didn't count the days.
- Well, I did.

608
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:21,193
Every one of them.

609
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:23,763
Mostly I remember the last one.

610
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:28,530
The wild finish. A guy standing
on a station platform in the rain...

611
00:49:28,703 --> 00:49:30,432
...with a comical look on his face...

612
00:49:30,605 --> 00:49:32,596
...because his insides
have been kicked out.

613
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:36,769
Can I tell you a story, Rick?

614
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:39,469
Does it got a wild finish?

615
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:41,774
I don't know the finish yet.

616
00:49:41,949 --> 00:49:45,385
Go on, tell it. Maybe one'll come
to you as you go along.

617
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:51,621
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris
from her home in Oslo.

618
00:49:51,792 --> 00:49:53,521
At the house of some friends...

619
00:49:53,694 --> 00:49:56,561
...she met a man about whom
she'd heard her whole life.

620
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:59,928
A very great and courageous man.

621
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:02,599
He opened up for her a whole
beautiful world...

622
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,364
...full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals.

623
00:50:05,773 --> 00:50:09,641
Everything she knew
or ever became was because of him.

624
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:11,573
And she looked up to him...

625
00:50:11,846 --> 00:50:13,313
...and worshiped him...

626
00:50:13,514 --> 00:50:16,312
...with a feeling she supposed was love.

627
00:50:16,484 --> 00:50:18,611
Yes, that's very pretty.

628
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:22,483
I heard a story once. In fact,
I've heard a lot of stories in my time.

629
00:50:22,657 --> 00:50:25,455
They went along with the sound
of a tinny piano...

630
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:27,958
...playing in the parlor downstairs.

631
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:33,457
"Mister, I met a man once
when I was a kid," they'd always begin.

632
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:39,536
I guess neither one of our stories
is very funny.

633
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:40,799
Tell me...

634
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,835
...who was it you left me for?

635
00:50:44,011 --> 00:50:46,844
Was it Laszlo,
or were there others in between...

636
00:50:47,582 --> 00:50:49,914
...or aren't you the kind that tells?

637
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:18,804
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the
letters of transit with Mr. Blaine.

638
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:21,346
I would suggest you search
the café immediately.

639
00:51:21,515 --> 00:51:24,575
If Rick has the letters, he's too smart
to let you find them there.

640
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:26,844
You give him credit
for too much cleverness.

641
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:29,615
My impression was he's just
another blundering American.

642
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:31,849
We mustn't underestimate
American blundering.

643
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:35,962
I was with them when they blundered
into Berlin in 1918.

644
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,031
As to Laszlo,
we want him watched 24 hours a day.

645
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,034
It may interest you to know that
at this very moment he's on his way here.

646
00:51:48,109 --> 00:51:50,737
There is nothing we can do.

647
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:54,442
I'm delighted to see you.
Did you have a good night's rest?

648
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:55,604
I slept very well.

649
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:58,377
Strange. Nobody's supposed
to sleep well in Casablanca.

650
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:03,522
- May we proceed with the business?
- With pleasure. Won't you sit down?

651
00:52:05,726 --> 00:52:09,093
Laszlo, we will not mince words.
You're an escaped prisoner of the Reich.

652
00:52:09,263 --> 00:52:11,595
So far you have been fortunate
in eluding us.

653
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:13,590
You have reached Casablanca.

654
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,530
It is my duty to see
that you stay in Casablanca.

655
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:18,864
Whether or not you will succeed
is problematic.

656
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,804
Not at all. Renault's signature
is necessary on every visa.

657
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:24,672
Captain, is it possible that Laszlo
will receive a visa?

658
00:52:24,845 --> 00:52:27,177
I'm afraid not. My regrets, monsieur.

659
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:29,440
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.

660
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:31,746
And mademoiselle?

661
00:52:31,919 --> 00:52:35,446
- You needn't be concerned about me.
- Is that all you wish to tell us?

662
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:38,557
Don't be in such a hurry.
You have all the time in the world.

663
00:52:38,726 --> 00:52:41,388
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely.

664
00:52:41,562 --> 00:52:43,496
Or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow.

665
00:52:43,664 --> 00:52:45,859
- On one condition.
- And that is?

666
00:52:46,133 --> 00:52:49,330
You know the leader of the underground
movement in Paris, in Prague...

667
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:50,868
...Brussels, Amsterdam...

668
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:53,336
...Oslo, Belgrade, Athens...

669
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:56,101
- Even Berlin.
- Yes, even in Berlin.

670
00:52:56,277 --> 00:52:58,905
If you will furnish me with their names
and whereabouts...

671
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,843
...you'll have your visa in the morning.

672
00:53:01,115 --> 00:53:03,777
And the honor of having served
the Third Reich.

673
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:06,680
I was in a German concentration camp
for a year.

674
00:53:07,188 --> 00:53:10,624
- That's honor enough for a lifetime.
- You will give us the names?

675
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,684
If I didn't give them to you
in a concentration camp...

676
00:53:14,895 --> 00:53:17,796
...where you had more persuasive methods
at your disposal...

677
00:53:17,998 --> 00:53:20,592
...I certainly won't give them to you now.

678
00:53:21,068 --> 00:53:23,434
And what if you track down
these men and kill them?

679
00:53:23,637 --> 00:53:25,161
What if you murdered all of us?

680
00:53:25,373 --> 00:53:29,707
From every corner of Europe, hundreds,
thousands would rise to take our places.

681
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:32,209
Even Nazis can't kill that fast.

682
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:35,907
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for
eloquence which I can now understand.

683
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:37,675
But in one aspect you are mistaken.

684
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:40,412
You said the enemies
of the Reich could all be replaced.

685
00:53:40,588 --> 00:53:42,112
But there is one exception.

686
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:44,917
No one could take your place
if anything unfortunate...

687
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:47,993
...should occur to you
while you were trying to escape.

688
00:53:48,396 --> 00:53:50,694
You won't dare to interfere with me here.

689
00:53:50,865 --> 00:53:52,423
This is still unoccupied France.

690
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,733
Any violation of neutrality
would reflect on Captain Renault.

691
00:53:55,903 --> 00:53:58,599
- Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power.
- Thank you.

692
00:53:58,773 --> 00:54:02,869
By the way, monsieur, last night
you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.

693
00:54:04,512 --> 00:54:07,379
I believe you have a message for him?

694
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:09,812
Nothing important.
But may I speak to him now?

695
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:13,377
You would find the conversation
a trifle one-sided.

696
00:54:13,554 --> 00:54:15,419
Signor Ugarte is dead.

697
00:54:22,027 --> 00:54:23,517
I'm making out the report now.

698
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,289
We haven't quite decided
whether he committed suicide...

699
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:28,830
...or died trying to escape.

700
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:33,164
- Are you quite finished with us?
- For the time being.

701
00:54:33,371 --> 00:54:34,861
Good day.

702
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,905
Undoubtedly, their next step will
be to the black market.

703
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,104
Excuse me, captain.

704
00:54:43,315 --> 00:54:46,307
Another visa problem has come up.

705
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:49,686
- Show her in.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:54:58,363 --> 00:55:01,389
Sorry, monsieur, we were never
to handle the police.

707
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:04,330
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari.
- Ferrari?

708
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,697
It can be most helpful
to know Signor Ferrari.

709
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,499
He pretty near has a monopoly
on the black market here.

710
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,767
You will find him at the Blue Parrot.

711
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:14,104
Thanks.

712
00:55:25,957 --> 00:55:27,356
Don't be too downhearted.

713
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:29,618
Perhaps you can come to terms with Renault.

714
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:31,125
Thank you very much, signor.

715
00:55:31,296 --> 00:55:33,730
- Hello, Ferrari.
- Good morning, Rick.

716
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,059
The bus is in.
I'll take my shipment with me.

717
00:55:36,267 --> 00:55:38,292
I'll have it sent over.
Have a drink with me.

718
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:42,702
I never drink in the morning. And every time
you send my shipment over it's a little short.

719
00:55:42,874 --> 00:55:44,842
Carrying charges, my boy.
Carrying charges.

720
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,306
Here, sit down.

721
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:49,139
There is something I want
to talk over with you, anyhow.

722
00:55:49,314 --> 00:55:50,941
Bourbon.

723
00:55:51,216 --> 00:55:53,150
The news about Ugarte
upsets me very much.

724
00:55:53,318 --> 00:55:56,515
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel
any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.

725
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,719
Of course not. What upsets me
is that Ugarte is dead...

726
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:01,916
...and no one knows where
those letters are.

727
00:56:02,093 --> 00:56:03,390
Practically no one.

728
00:56:03,595 --> 00:56:05,859
If I had those letters,
I could make a fortune.

729
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:08,190
So could I,
and I'm a poor businessman.

730
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,234
I have a proposition for whoever has those
letters. I'll handle the entire transaction.

731
00:56:12,404 --> 00:56:15,271
Get rid of the letters, take all the risk,
for a small percentage.

732
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:16,963
And the carrying charges?

733
00:56:17,142 --> 00:56:19,906
Naturally there will be a few
incidental expenses.

734
00:56:20,612 --> 00:56:23,012
That's my proposition
for whoever has those letters.

735
00:56:23,181 --> 00:56:24,739
I'll tell him when he comes in.

736
00:56:24,916 --> 00:56:27,544
Rick, I think you know
where those letters are.

737
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:31,016
You're in good company.
Renault and Strasser probably think so too.

738
00:56:36,728 --> 00:56:39,754
That's why I came here. To give
them a chance to ransack my place.

739
00:56:39,931 --> 00:56:43,264
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into
your confidence. You need a partner.

740
00:56:43,435 --> 00:56:45,369
Excuse me, I'll be getting back.

741
00:56:48,973 --> 00:56:52,704
- Morning.
- Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.

742
00:56:57,382 --> 00:57:00,010
You will not find a treasure like this
in all Morocco.

743
00:57:00,218 --> 00:57:01,515
Only 700 francs.

744
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:04,882
- You're being cheated.
- Doesn't matter, thank you.

745
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:08,184
For friends of Rick's
we have a small discount.

746
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:10,918
Did I say 700 francs?
You can have it for 200.

747
00:57:11,095 --> 00:57:14,758
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you
when you called on me last night.

748
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:15,922
Doesn't matter.

749
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:20,036
For special friends of Rick's
we have a special discount. 100 francs.

750
00:57:20,205 --> 00:57:23,231
Your story had me a little confused.
Or maybe it was the bourbon.

751
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,033
I have some tablecloths, napkins--

752
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:27,906
- Thank you. I'm really not interested.
- Please, one minute.

753
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:31,708
Why did you come back? To tell me why you
ran out on me at the railway station?

754
00:57:31,883 --> 00:57:32,907
Yes.

755
00:57:33,084 --> 00:57:35,450
Well, you can tell me now.
I'm reasonably sober.

756
00:57:35,687 --> 00:57:37,211
I don't think I will, Rick.

757
00:57:37,388 --> 00:57:41,688
Why not? After all, I got stuck with
a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.

758
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,055
Last night I saw
what has happened to you.

759
00:57:44,729 --> 00:57:47,960
The Rick I knew in Paris,
I could tell him, he'd understand.

760
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,692
But the one who looked at me
with such hatred...

761
00:57:52,237 --> 00:57:55,263
I'll be leaving Casablanca soon.
We'll never see each other again.

762
00:57:56,407 --> 00:58:00,468
We knew very little about each other
when we were in love in Paris.

763
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:05,446
If we leave it that way, maybe we'll
remember those days and not Casablanca.

764
00:58:05,917 --> 00:58:07,043
Not last night.

765
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:10,950
Did you run out on me because
you knew what it would be like?

766
00:58:11,122 --> 00:58:14,023
Hiding from the police,
running away all the time?

767
00:58:14,192 --> 00:58:15,887
You can believe that if you want to.

768
00:58:16,094 --> 00:58:18,824
Well, I'm not running away anymore.
I'm settled now.

769
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:20,794
Above a saloon, it's true...

770
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,432
...but walk up a flight...

771
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,329
...I'll be expecting you.

772
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:29,202
All the same,
someday you'll lie to Laszlo.

773
00:58:29,374 --> 00:58:31,103
You'll be there.

774
00:58:32,644 --> 00:58:33,668
No, Rick.

775
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,343
No. You see, Victor Laszlo
is my husband.

776
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:41,944
And was,
even when I knew you in Paris.

777
00:58:46,524 --> 00:58:51,086
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo
that unfortunately I'm not able to help him.

778
00:58:51,262 --> 00:58:53,162
You see, my dear, word has gone around.

779
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,926
As leader of all illegal activities in
Casablanca, I am influential and respected.

780
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:01,538
But it would not be worth my life
to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo.

781
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,537
You, however, are a different matter.

782
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:08,344
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible
to get an exit visa for you.

783
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,908
- You mean for me to go on alone?
- And only alone.

784
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:15,381
I'll stay here and keep on trying.
I'm sure in a little while--

785
00:59:15,553 --> 00:59:17,350
Might as well be frank, monsieur.

786
00:59:17,522 --> 00:59:20,980
It would take a miracle to get you out.
The Germans have outlawed miracles.

787
00:59:21,459 --> 00:59:23,586
We are only interested in two visas.

788
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:26,025
- Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
- No, Victor.

789
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,457
You two will want to discuss this.

790
00:59:28,633 --> 00:59:30,601
Excuse me. I'll be at the bar.

791
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:36,269
No, Ilsa.
I won't let you stay here.

792
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:39,808
You must get to America. Believe me,
somehow I will get out and join you.

793
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,841
But if the situation were different...

794
00:59:42,013 --> 00:59:44,573
...if I had to stay
and there were only visa for one...

795
00:59:44,749 --> 00:59:46,046
...would you take it?

796
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:48,343
Yes, I would.

797
00:59:49,554 --> 00:59:50,748
Yes, I see.

798
00:59:51,923 --> 00:59:55,825
When I had trouble getting out of Lille,
why didn't you leave me there?

799
00:59:55,994 --> 01:00:00,055
When I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks
and you were in danger every minute...

800
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:02,028
...why didn't you leave me then?

801
01:00:03,334 --> 01:00:05,825
I meant to,
but something always held me up.

802
01:00:08,306 --> 01:00:09,773
I love you very much, Ilsa.

803
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:13,068
Your secret will be safe with me.

804
01:00:14,145 --> 01:00:16,238
Ferrari is waiting for our answer.

805
01:00:16,414 --> 01:00:18,746
Not more than 50 francs.

806
01:00:23,488 --> 01:00:25,285
We've decided, Signor Ferrari.

807
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:28,823
For the present we will go on looking
for two visas. Thank you very much.

808
01:00:28,993 --> 01:00:30,961
Well, good luck, but be careful.

809
01:00:31,129 --> 01:00:33,962
- You know you're being shadowed?
- Of course. It becomes an instinct.

810
01:00:34,298 --> 01:00:37,324
I observe that you, in one respect,
are a very fortunate man.

811
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:40,231
I am moved to make one more suggestion.
Why, I do not know.

812
01:00:40,405 --> 01:00:42,305
Because it cannot possibly profit me.

813
01:00:42,507 --> 01:00:45,670
Have you heard about Ugarte
and the letters of transit?

814
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:46,832
Yes, something.

815
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:50,208
Those letters were not found on Ugarte
when they arrested him.

816
01:00:50,381 --> 01:00:52,372
- You know where they are?
- Not for sure.

817
01:00:52,583 --> 01:00:55,609
But I'd guess that Ugarte
left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

818
01:00:57,522 --> 01:01:00,719
A difficult customer, that Rick.
One never knows what he'll do or why.

819
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:02,552
But it is worth a chance.

820
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:05,925
Thank you very much.
Good day.

821
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:09,861
Goodbye. Thank you for your coffee.
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca.

822
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:12,901
Gracious of you to share it with me.
Good day, mademoiselle.

823
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:15,505
- Monsieur.
- Good day.

824
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:26,543
- Here's to you, sir.
- Good luck.

825
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,882
- I'd better be going.
- My check, please.

826
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:32,818
I have to warn you, sir.
This is a dangerous place. Full of vultures.

827
01:01:33,024 --> 01:01:35,857
- Vultures everywhere. Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.

828
01:01:36,027 --> 01:01:37,654
It has been a pleasure to meet you.

829
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:39,490
I'm sorry.

830
01:01:55,346 --> 01:01:59,043
Monsieur Rick,
you are getting to be your best customer.

831
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:03,451
Well, drinking.
I'm very pleased with you.

832
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:05,521
You're beginning
to live like a Frenchman.

833
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:08,055
That was some going-over
your men gave my place.

834
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:10,217
We barely got cleaned up
in time to open.

835
01:02:10,394 --> 01:02:12,658
I told Strasser he wouldn't
find the letters here.

836
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:14,957
But I told my men
to be especially destructive.

837
01:02:15,133 --> 01:02:17,067
You know how
that impresses Germans.

838
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,700
Rick, have you got
those letters of transit?

839
01:02:21,072 --> 01:02:23,165
Louis, are you Pro-Vichy
or Free French?

840
01:02:23,808 --> 01:02:28,268
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
The subject is closed.

841
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:31,044
It looks like you're a little late.

842
01:02:38,356 --> 01:02:40,017
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.

843
01:02:40,191 --> 01:02:43,957
Who knows? In her own way,
she may constitute an entire second front.

844
01:02:44,362 --> 01:02:47,854
I think it's time for me to flatter
Strasser a little. I'll see you later.

845
01:02:48,699 --> 01:02:50,132
Sascha!

846
01:02:50,301 --> 01:02:51,325
French 75s.

847
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:55,199
Put up a whole row of them, Sascha.
Starting here and ending here.

848
01:02:55,373 --> 01:02:56,704
We will begin with two.

849
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,978
What did you say?
Would you kindly repeat it?

850
01:03:08,186 --> 01:03:11,553
- What I said is none of your business.
- I'll make it my business.

851
01:03:17,728 --> 01:03:21,391
I don't like disturbances in my place.
Either lay off politics or get out.

852
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:27,328
You see, captain?

853
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:29,972
The situation is not as under control
as you believe.

854
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:32,039
We try to cooperate
with your government.

855
01:03:32,243 --> 01:03:34,507
But we cannot regulate
the feelings of our people.

856
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,840
Captain, are you certain
which side you're on?

857
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:39,309
I have no conviction,
if that's what you mean.

858
01:03:39,517 --> 01:03:40,814
I blow with the wind...

859
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:43,385
...and the prevailing wind
happens to be from Vichy.

860
01:03:43,588 --> 01:03:45,283
And if it should change?

861
01:03:45,556 --> 01:03:47,717
Surely the Reich doesn't admit
that possibility?

862
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:49,985
We are concerned
about more than Casablanca.

863
01:03:50,194 --> 01:03:53,595
We know that every French province
in Africa is honeycombed with traitors.

864
01:03:54,098 --> 01:03:56,794
Waiting for their chance.
Waiting perhaps for a leader.

865
01:03:56,968 --> 01:03:58,526
A leader? Like Laszlo?

866
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:00,501
I have been thinking.

867
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:04,137
It's too dangerous to let him go,
it may be too dangerous to let him stay.

868
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:05,297
I see what you mean.

869
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,080
Thank you, Carl.

870
01:04:13,284 --> 01:04:15,514
Thank you, Carl.

871
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,654
Sit down. Have a brandy with us.

872
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:20,423
To celebrate our leaving
for America tomorrow.

873
01:04:20,591 --> 01:04:21,683
Thank you very much.

874
01:04:21,893 --> 01:04:24,623
I thought you would ask me,
so I brought the good brandy...

875
01:04:24,829 --> 01:04:26,660
...and a third glass.

876
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:28,822
At last the day's came!

877
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,833
Frau Leuchtag and I
are speaking nothing but English now.

878
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:34,870
So we should feel at home
when we get to America.

879
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,700
A very nice idea.

880
01:04:37,041 --> 01:04:38,269
To America.

881
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:40,032
To America.

882
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,017
What watch?

883
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,879
- Ten watch.
- Such much?

884
01:04:54,525 --> 01:04:56,857
You will get along beautifully in America.

885
01:04:57,862 --> 01:04:59,625
How is lady luck treating you?

886
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,661
Oh, too bad.

887
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:03,864
You'll find him over there.

888
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,631
- Monsieur Rick?
- Yes?

889
01:05:11,809 --> 01:05:15,040
- Could I speak to you, please?
- How'd you get in here? You're underage.

890
01:05:15,212 --> 01:05:17,544
- I came with Captain Renault.
- I should have known.

891
01:05:17,715 --> 01:05:19,046
My husband is with me too.

892
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,980
He is? Captain Renault's getting
broad-minded. Sit down.

893
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:23,142
Have a drink?

894
01:05:23,321 --> 01:05:26,017
No, of course not. You mind if I do?

895
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:27,682
Monsieur Rick...

896
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:31,987
- ...what kind of a man is Captain Renault?
- Like any other man, only more so.

897
01:05:32,163 --> 01:05:33,152
No, I mean...

898
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:35,158
...is he trustworthy?
Is his word--?

899
01:05:35,533 --> 01:05:39,469
- Just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
- He did. Captain Renault did.

900
01:05:39,637 --> 01:05:41,696
I thought so. Where's your husband?

901
01:05:41,973 --> 01:05:46,239
At the roulette table,
trying to win enough for our exit visas.

902
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,207
Oh, of course he's losing.

903
01:05:48,446 --> 01:05:51,347
- How long have you been married?
- Eight weeks.

904
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,010
We come from Bulgaria.

905
01:05:54,618 --> 01:05:56,848
Things are very bad there.

906
01:05:57,021 --> 01:05:59,216
The devil has the people
by the throat.

907
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:02,148
So Jan and I, we...

908
01:06:02,326 --> 01:06:05,022
We do not want our children
to grow up in such a country.

909
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:07,595
- So you decided to go to America.
- Yes.

910
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:10,165
But we haven't much money...

911
01:06:10,334 --> 01:06:12,802
...and traveling is so expensive
and difficult.

912
01:06:13,204 --> 01:06:15,229
It was much more than we thought
to get here.

913
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:17,771
And then Captain Renault sees us...

914
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,944
- ...and he is so kind, he wants to help us.
- Yes, I'll bet.

915
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:24,305
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.

916
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:26,114
But we have no money.

917
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:28,009
- Does he know that?
- Yes.

918
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:30,517
- And he's still willing to give you a visa?
- Yes.

919
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:33,657
- And you want to know...?
- Will he keep his word?

920
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:35,851
He always has.

921
01:06:41,032 --> 01:06:43,057
You are a man.

922
01:06:43,234 --> 01:06:45,896
If someone loved you very much...

923
01:06:46,103 --> 01:06:50,335
...so that your happiness was the only thing
that she wanted in the world...

924
01:06:50,908 --> 01:06:53,775
...and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it...

925
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:57,372
- ...could you forgive her?
- Nobody ever loved me that much.

926
01:06:57,548 --> 01:07:01,382
And he never knew, and the girl kept
this bad thing locked in her heart...

927
01:07:01,552 --> 01:07:03,349
...that would be all right,
wouldn't it?

928
01:07:03,521 --> 01:07:05,648
- You want my advice?
- Yes, please.

929
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:07,249
Go back to Bulgaria.

930
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:11,723
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us
to leave Europe, to get to America...

931
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:17,059
Oh, but if Jan should find out.
He is such a boy.

932
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:20,670
In many ways
I am so much older than he is.

933
01:07:20,838 --> 01:07:23,238
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca
has problems.

934
01:07:23,441 --> 01:07:26,569
- Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
- Thank you, monsieur.

935
01:07:35,286 --> 01:07:36,583
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

936
01:07:36,754 --> 01:07:40,281
- You see? Here we are again.
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

937
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:43,689
I suppose he means to you
Paris of happier days.

938
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:47,424
He does. Could we
have a table close to him?

939
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,963
And as far away
from Major Strasser as possible.

940
01:07:50,301 --> 01:07:52,792
The geography may be
a little difficult to arrange.

941
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:54,733
- Paul, table 30.
- Yes, sir.

942
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:56,702
Right this way, if you please.

943
01:07:56,874 --> 01:08:00,640
I'll have Sam play "As Time Goes By."
I believe that's your favorite tune.

944
01:08:00,878 --> 01:08:02,140
Thank you.

945
01:08:11,555 --> 01:08:14,183
- Two cognacs, please.
- Cognac.

946
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:39,841
Do you wish to place another bet, sir?

947
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:42,113
No. No, I guess not.

948
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:44,151
Have you tried 22 tonight?

949
01:08:45,723 --> 01:08:47,122
I said 22.

950
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:04,805
Leave it there.

951
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:21,655
Cash it in and don't come back.

952
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,419
Are you sure this place is honest?

953
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:30,831
Honest? As honest as the day is long.

954
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:35,102
How are we doing tonight?

955
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,101
A couple of thousand less
than I thought there would be.

956
01:09:41,812 --> 01:09:43,780
Monsieur Rick...

957
01:09:48,819 --> 01:09:50,446
He's just a lucky guy.

958
01:09:53,157 --> 01:09:56,058
Monsieur Rick,
may I get you a cup of coffee?

959
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:58,286
- No, thanks, Carl.
- Monsieur Rick...

960
01:10:01,799 --> 01:10:03,289
Captain Renault, may I--?

961
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:07,426
Not here. Come to my office in the morning.
We'll do everything businesslike.

962
01:10:07,605 --> 01:10:10,335
- We'll be there at 6.
- I'll be there at 10.

963
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:12,372
I'm very happy for both of you.

964
01:10:12,543 --> 01:10:14,636
Still, it's very strange that you won.

965
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:17,076
Well, maybe not so strange.

966
01:10:17,248 --> 01:10:20,081
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Thank you, Captain Renault.

967
01:10:20,484 --> 01:10:22,076
No!

968
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:30,692
Boss, you've done a beautiful thing.

969
01:10:31,462 --> 01:10:33,896
Go away, you crazy Russian.

970
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:47,607
- As I suspected. You're a rank sentimentalist.
- Yeah? Why?

971
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:49,973
Why do you interfere
with my little romances?

972
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:52,011
Put it down as a gesture to love.

973
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:53,706
Well, I'll forgive you this time.

974
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:56,750
But I'll be in tomorrow night
with a breathtaking blond.

975
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,115
And it'll make me very happy if she loses.

976
01:11:03,193 --> 01:11:06,321
- Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
- Go ahead.

977
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,122
Well, isn't there some other place?

978
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:10,823
It's rather confidential,
what I have to say.

979
01:11:12,803 --> 01:11:15,033
- In my office.
- Right.

980
01:11:16,106 --> 01:11:18,768
You must know it's very important
I get out of Casablanca.

981
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,934
It's my privilege to be one of the leaders
of a great movement.

982
01:11:22,112 --> 01:11:23,875
You know what I've been doing.

983
01:11:24,048 --> 01:11:27,984
You know what it means to the work,
to the lives of thousands of people...

984
01:11:28,152 --> 01:11:30,416
...that I reach America
and continue my work.

985
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:32,020
I'm not interested in politics.

986
01:11:32,189 --> 01:11:34,680
The problems of the world
are not in my department.

987
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,050
I'm a saloonkeeper.

988
01:11:36,393 --> 01:11:39,954
My friends in the underground tell me
that you have quite a record.

989
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,654
You ran guns to Ethiopia.

990
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:44,699
- You fought against the fascists in Spain.
- What of it?

991
01:11:44,868 --> 01:11:48,031
Isn't it strange you're always
fighting on the side of the underdog?

992
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:50,172
Yes, I found that a very expensive hobby.

993
01:11:50,374 --> 01:11:52,604
But then I never was
much of a businessman.

994
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:56,143
Are you enough of a businessman
to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs?

995
01:11:56,313 --> 01:11:59,180
- I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
- 200,000.

996
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,075
My friend, you could make it
a million francs or three.

997
01:12:02,286 --> 01:12:04,083
My answer would still be the same.

998
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:06,415
There must be some reason
why you won't let me.

999
01:12:06,623 --> 01:12:07,749
There is.

1000
01:12:08,225 --> 01:12:10,352
I suggest that you ask your wife.

1001
01:12:10,661 --> 01:12:13,289
- I beg your pardon?
- I said, ask your wife.

1002
01:12:13,664 --> 01:12:16,064
- My wife?
- Yes.

1003
01:12:56,473 --> 01:12:58,464
Play "La Marseillaise."
Play it!

1004
01:14:14,518 --> 01:14:18,511
See what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in
a café can inspire this demonstration...

1005
01:14:18,689 --> 01:14:21,157
...what more will his presence
in Casablanca bring on?

1006
01:14:21,325 --> 01:14:23,316
I advise that this place
be shut up at once.

1007
01:14:23,594 --> 01:14:26,563
- But everybody's having a good time.
- Yes, much too good a time.

1008
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:27,924
The place is to be closed.

1009
01:14:28,098 --> 01:14:31,158
- But I have no excuse to close it.
- Find one.

1010
01:14:36,073 --> 01:14:37,700
Everybody is to leave immediately.

1011
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:40,171
This café is closed until further notice.

1012
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:42,002
Clear the room at once.

1013
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:46,814
How can you close me up?

1014
01:14:47,017 --> 01:14:50,475
I'm shocked, shocked to find that
gambling is going on in here.

1015
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:52,554
- Your winnings, sir.
- Thank you.

1016
01:14:52,723 --> 01:14:53,985
Everybody out at once.

1017
01:14:58,428 --> 01:15:02,364
After this disturbance it is not safe
for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.

1018
01:15:02,533 --> 01:15:05,331
This morning you implied it wasn't safe
to leave Casablanca.

1019
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:08,437
That is also true, except for one destination:
occupied France.

1020
01:15:08,639 --> 01:15:11,540
- Occupied France?
- Under safe conduct from me.

1021
01:15:11,775 --> 01:15:12,764
Of what value is that?

1022
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:15,969
You may recall what German guarantees
have been worth in the past.

1023
01:15:16,146 --> 01:15:19,411
- There are two other alternatives for him.
- What are they?

1024
01:15:19,583 --> 01:15:23,883
The French authorities may find a reason
to put him in the concentration camp here.

1025
01:15:24,054 --> 01:15:25,146
The other alternative?

1026
01:15:25,322 --> 01:15:30,089
My dear, perhaps you have already observed
that in Casablanca human life is cheap.

1027
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:31,591
Good night, mademoiselle.

1028
01:15:42,306 --> 01:15:45,798
- What happened with Rick?
- We'll discuss it later.

1029
01:16:08,732 --> 01:16:10,723
Our faithful friend is still there.

1030
01:16:11,268 --> 01:16:13,793
Please don't go
to the underground meeting tonight.

1031
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:15,129
I must.

1032
01:16:15,305 --> 01:16:18,763
Besides, it isn't often that a man gets
to display heroics before his wife.

1033
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:22,275
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's
warning tonight, I'm frightened.

1034
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,310
Tell you the truth,
I'm frightened too.

1035
01:16:24,481 --> 01:16:26,915
Shall I remain here
in a hotel room, hiding?

1036
01:16:27,117 --> 01:16:28,744
Or shall I carry on the best I can?

1037
01:16:29,152 --> 01:16:31,814
Whatever I'd say,
you would carry on.

1038
01:16:32,689 --> 01:16:35,624
Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick?
What did you find out?

1039
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:38,158
- Apparently he has the letters.
- Yes?

1040
01:16:38,328 --> 01:16:39,886
But no intention of selling them.

1041
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:43,760
You'd think if sentiment
wouldn't persuade him, money would.

1042
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,492
Did he give any reason?

1043
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:48,967
- He suggested I ask you.
- Ask me?

1044
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:51,333
Yes, he said, "Ask your wife."

1045
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:54,072
I don't know why he said that.

1046
01:17:06,623 --> 01:17:09,353
Well, our friend outside will think
we've retired by now.

1047
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,558
I'll be going in a few minutes.

1048
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:17,122
- Ilsa, I...
- Yes?

1049
01:17:18,402 --> 01:17:20,666
When I was in the concentration camp...

1050
01:17:21,238 --> 01:17:23,763
...were you lonely in Paris?

1051
01:17:25,242 --> 01:17:27,233
Yes, Victor, I was.

1052
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,180
I know how it is to be lonely.

1053
01:17:32,249 --> 01:17:34,581
Is there anything you wish to tell me?

1054
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:38,577
No, Victor, there isn't.

1055
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:45,751
I love you very much, my dear.

1056
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:51,090
Yes, I know.

1057
01:17:51,935 --> 01:17:54,369
Victor, whatever I do,
will you believe that I...?

1058
01:17:54,538 --> 01:17:57,234
You don't even have to say it.

1059
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:59,170
I'll believe.

1060
01:18:01,278 --> 01:18:02,609
Good night, dear.

1061
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:05,945
Good night.

1062
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:15,651
- Victor.
- Yes, dear?

1063
01:18:20,964 --> 01:18:22,329
Be careful.

1064
01:18:23,934 --> 01:18:25,492
Of course I'll be careful.

1065
01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:12,042
Well, you are in
pretty good shape, Herr Rick.

1066
01:19:12,215 --> 01:19:14,012
How long can I afford to stay closed?

1067
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:15,981
Two weeks, maybe three.

1068
01:19:16,186 --> 01:19:18,416
Maybe I won't have to.
A bribe has worked before.

1069
01:19:18,622 --> 01:19:20,852
In the meantime,
everybody stays on salary.

1070
01:19:21,024 --> 01:19:22,389
Thank you, Herr Rick.

1071
01:19:22,559 --> 01:19:25,926
Sascha will be happy to hear it.
I owe him money.

1072
01:19:26,496 --> 01:19:29,329
- You finish locking up, will you, Carl?
- I will.

1073
01:19:29,499 --> 01:19:32,627
- Then I am going to the meeting--
- Don't tell me where you're going.

1074
01:19:32,803 --> 01:19:33,997
I won't.

1075
01:19:35,172 --> 01:19:36,230
Good night.

1076
01:19:37,374 --> 01:19:38,966
Good night, Mr. Rick.

1077
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:59,026
- How did you get in?
- The stairs from the street.

1078
01:19:59,196 --> 01:20:02,529
I told you this morning you'd come around,
but this is ahead of schedule.

1079
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:03,927
Well, won't you sit down?

1080
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:08,036
- Richard, I had to see you.
- "Richard" again. We're back in Paris.

1081
01:20:08,205 --> 01:20:11,504
Your visit isn't connected
by any chance with the letters of transit?

1082
01:20:11,708 --> 01:20:14,404
Seems as long as I have those letters
I'll never be lonely.

1083
01:20:14,578 --> 01:20:17,206
Ask any price you want,
but you must give me the letters.

1084
01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:19,940
I went all through that
with your husband. It's no deal.

1085
01:20:20,517 --> 01:20:22,246
I know how you feel about me...

1086
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:25,183
...but put your feelings aside
for something more important.

1087
01:20:25,355 --> 01:20:27,823
I have to hear again
what a great man your husband is...

1088
01:20:27,991 --> 01:20:29,982
...what an important cause
he's fighting for?

1089
01:20:30,160 --> 01:20:31,491
It was your cause too.

1090
01:20:31,695 --> 01:20:34,163
In your own way, you were fighting
for the same thing.

1091
01:20:34,598 --> 01:20:37,294
I'm not fighting for anything
anymore except myself.

1092
01:20:37,534 --> 01:20:39,525
I'm the only cause I'm interested in.

1093
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:49,636
We loved each other once.
If those days meant anything at all to you--

1094
01:20:49,813 --> 01:20:52,748
I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you.
It's poor salesmanship.

1095
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:56,374
Listen to me. If you knew what really
happened, if you only knew the truth--

1096
01:20:56,553 --> 01:20:58,612
I wouldn't believe you
no matter what you said.

1097
01:20:58,788 --> 01:21:01,814
You'd say anything now
to get what you want.

1098
01:21:06,062 --> 01:21:08,792
You want to feel sorry for yourself,
don't you?

1099
01:21:08,965 --> 01:21:11,729
With so much at stake
all you can think of is your feelings.

1100
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:16,465
One woman has hurt you, and you
take your revenge on the rest of the world.

1101
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:19,165
You're a coward and a weakling.

1102
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:25,446
No. Oh, Richard. I'm sorry.

1103
01:21:26,516 --> 01:21:29,485
I'm sorry, but you are our last hope.

1104
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:32,349
If you don't help us,
Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

1105
01:21:32,589 --> 01:21:33,578
What of it?

1106
01:21:33,757 --> 01:21:36,419
I'm going to die in Casablanca.
It's a good spot for it.

1107
01:21:43,266 --> 01:21:45,097
Now, if you'll--

1108
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:48,767
All right.

1109
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:50,964
I tried to reason with you.

1110
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:53,371
I tried everything.
Now, I want those letters.

1111
01:21:53,777 --> 01:21:56,905
- Get them for me.
- I don't have to. I got them right here.

1112
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:00,346
Put them on the table.

1113
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:03,241
No.

1114
01:22:04,354 --> 01:22:06,447
For the last time,
put them on the table.

1115
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:11,750
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much
to you, you won't stop at anything.

1116
01:22:13,163 --> 01:22:15,154
All right,
I'll make it easier for you.

1117
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,297
Go ahead and shoot.
You'll be doing me a favor.

1118
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:28,109
Richard...

1119
01:22:28,278 --> 01:22:30,644
...I tried to stay away.

1120
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:33,676
I thought I would never see you again.

1121
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:37,286
That you were out of my life.

1122
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:59,565
The day you left Paris...

1123
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:03,135
...if you knew what I went through.

1124
01:23:04,814 --> 01:23:07,476
If you knew how much I loved you.

1125
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:11,318
How much I still love you.

1126
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:26,225
And then?

1127
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:32,605
It wasn't long after we were married
that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia.

1128
01:23:32,776 --> 01:23:36,303
They needed him in Prague,
but there the Gestapo were waiting for him.

1129
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:38,208
Just a two-line item in the paper:

1130
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:41,009
"Victor Laszlo apprehended.
Sent to concentration camp."

1131
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,517
I was frantic.
For months I tried to get word.

1132
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:46,016
Then it came.

1133
01:23:46,222 --> 01:23:48,383
He was dead.
Shot trying to escape.

1134
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:52,183
I was lonely.
I had nothing, not even hope.

1135
01:23:53,596 --> 01:23:55,029
Then I met you.

1136
01:23:55,365 --> 01:23:58,698
Why weren't you honest with me?
Why did you keep your marriage a secret?

1137
01:23:58,902 --> 01:24:01,962
It wasn't my secret, Richard.
Victor wanted it that way.

1138
01:24:02,172 --> 01:24:04,697
Not even our closest friends
knew about our marriage.

1139
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:08,110
That was his way of protecting me.
I knew so much about his work.

1140
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:11,610
If the Gestapo found out I was his wife
it would be dangerous for me...

1141
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:13,305
...and for those working with us.

1142
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,282
And when did you first find out
he was alive?

1143
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,845
Just before you and I
were to leave Paris together.

1144
01:24:20,023 --> 01:24:22,457
A friend came and told me
that Victor was alive.

1145
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,753
They were hiding him in a freight car
on the outskirts of Paris.

1146
01:24:26,096 --> 01:24:28,087
He was sick. He needed me.

1147
01:24:29,666 --> 01:24:32,294
I wanted to tell you,
but I didn't dare.

1148
01:24:32,469 --> 01:24:36,428
I knew you wouldn't have left Paris,
and the Gestapo would have caught you.

1149
01:24:37,474 --> 01:24:39,203
Well...

1150
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:41,203
...well, you know the rest.

1151
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:47,240
Well, it's still a story without an ending.

1152
01:24:47,417 --> 01:24:48,543
What about now?

1153
01:24:49,786 --> 01:24:50,775
Now?

1154
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:53,112
I don't know.

1155
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:56,816
I know that I'll never have the strength
to leave you again.

1156
01:24:58,027 --> 01:24:59,085
And Laszlo?

1157
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:02,693
You'll help him now, Richard, won't you?
You'll see that he gets out.

1158
01:25:02,866 --> 01:25:06,199
Then he'll have his work.
All that he's been living for.

1159
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:07,859
All except one.

1160
01:25:09,339 --> 01:25:10,772
He won't have you.

1161
01:25:12,909 --> 01:25:14,672
I can't fight it anymore.

1162
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,778
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.

1163
01:25:21,751 --> 01:25:24,811
Oh, I don't know
what's right any longer.

1164
01:25:24,988 --> 01:25:27,047
You have to think for both of us.

1165
01:25:28,057 --> 01:25:29,456
For all of us.

1166
01:25:33,062 --> 01:25:35,724
All right. I will.

1167
01:25:39,869 --> 01:25:41,564
Here's looking at you, kid.

1168
01:25:43,373 --> 01:25:46,467
I wish I didn't love you so much.

1169
01:25:58,855 --> 01:26:00,914
- I think we lost them.
- Yes.

1170
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:04,253
- I'm afraid they caught some of the others.
- Come inside.

1171
01:26:08,565 --> 01:26:13,434
Come, Mr. Laszlo,
I will help you immediately.

1172
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:15,433
Thank you.

1173
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:35,050
Carl, what happened?

1174
01:26:35,225 --> 01:26:38,854
The police break up our meeting, Herr Rick.
We escaped at the last moment.

1175
01:26:39,062 --> 01:26:41,360
- Come up here a minute.
- Yes, I come.

1176
01:26:41,531 --> 01:26:44,830
Turn out the light in the rear entrance.
It might attract the police.

1177
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:47,730
- But Sascha always puts out that light.
- Tonight he forgot.

1178
01:26:48,438 --> 01:26:50,668
Yes, I come. I will do it.

1179
01:26:58,348 --> 01:27:01,840
- I want you to take Miss Lund home.
- Yes, sir.

1180
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:15,957
It's nothing, just a little cut.
We had to get through a window.

1181
01:27:16,132 --> 01:27:17,895
This might come in handy.

1182
01:27:18,101 --> 01:27:19,193
Thank you.

1183
01:27:19,435 --> 01:27:22,029
- Had a close one, eh?
- Yes, rather.

1184
01:27:24,073 --> 01:27:26,803
Don't you sometimes wonder
if it's worth all this?

1185
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,910
I mean, what you're fighting for.

1186
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,005
We might as well question
why we breathe.

1187
01:27:32,181 --> 01:27:33,739
If we stop breathing, we'll die.

1188
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,350
If we stop fighting our enemies,
the world will die.

1189
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,783
What of it?
Then it'll be out of its misery.

1190
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:41,116
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine?

1191
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:45,455
Like a man who's trying to convince himself
of something he doesn't believe in his heart.

1192
01:27:45,628 --> 01:27:49,223
Each of us has a destiny.
For good, or for evil.

1193
01:27:49,766 --> 01:27:52,291
- I get the point.
- I wonder if you do.

1194
01:27:52,635 --> 01:27:55,729
I wonder if you know that you're trying
to escape from yourself...

1195
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,496
...and that you'll never succeed.

1196
01:27:57,674 --> 01:27:59,904
You seem to know all about my destiny.

1197
01:28:01,711 --> 01:28:04,305
I know a good deal more
about you than you suspect.

1198
01:28:04,681 --> 01:28:06,876
I know that you're in love with a woman.

1199
01:28:07,083 --> 01:28:08,846
It's perhaps a strange circumstance...

1200
01:28:09,018 --> 01:28:11,919
...that we both should be in love
with the same woman.

1201
01:28:12,088 --> 01:28:14,249
The first evening I came into this café...

1202
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:16,790
...I knew there was something
between you and Ilsa.

1203
01:28:17,593 --> 01:28:19,254
Since no one is to blame...

1204
01:28:19,696 --> 01:28:21,687
...I demand no explanation.

1205
01:28:21,864 --> 01:28:25,163
I ask only one thing.
You won't give me the letters of transit.

1206
01:28:25,335 --> 01:28:26,893
All right.

1207
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:29,004
But I want my wife to be safe.

1208
01:28:29,272 --> 01:28:30,705
I ask you as a favor...

1209
01:28:30,873 --> 01:28:33,808
...to use the letters
to take her away from Casablanca.

1210
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:35,068
You love her that much?

1211
01:28:35,278 --> 01:28:38,042
Apparently you think of me only
as the leader of a cause.

1212
01:28:38,681 --> 01:28:41,206
Well, I am also a human being.

1213
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:43,541
Yes, I love her that much.

1214
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:52,658
- Monsieur Laszlo?
- Yes?

1215
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:55,354
You'll come with us.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1216
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:56,520
On what charge?

1217
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:58,894
Captain Renault will discuss that
with you later.

1218
01:28:59,068 --> 01:29:01,798
It seems that destiny has taken a hand.

1219
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:17,747
You haven't any proof, and you know it.
This isn't Germany or occupied France.

1220
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:21,981
All you can do is fine him and give him
30 days. You might as well let him go now.

1221
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:25,184
I'd advise you not to be too interested
in what happens to Laszlo.

1222
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,828
If you were to help him escape--

1223
01:29:26,996 --> 01:29:29,430
What makes you think
I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?

1224
01:29:29,599 --> 01:29:32,067
Because, one,
you bet 10,000 francs he'd escape.

1225
01:29:32,235 --> 01:29:35,329
Two, you've got the letters of transit.
Don't bother to deny it.

1226
01:29:35,538 --> 01:29:38,598
And you might do it simply
because you don't like Strasser's looks.

1227
01:29:38,775 --> 01:29:40,640
As a matter of fact,
I don't either.

1228
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:42,209
They're all excellent reasons.

1229
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:44,312
Don't count too much on my friendship.

1230
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,938
In this matter I'm powerless.
Besides, I might lose the 10,000 francs.

1231
01:29:48,284 --> 01:29:52,846
You're not very subtle,
but you are effective. I get the point.

1232
01:29:53,022 --> 01:29:54,512
Yes, I have the letters.

1233
01:29:54,724 --> 01:29:56,521
But I intend using them myself.

1234
01:29:56,926 --> 01:30:00,453
I'm leaving Casablanca
on tonight's plane. The last plane.

1235
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:03,690
And I'm taking a friend with me.
One you'll appreciate.

1236
01:30:03,866 --> 01:30:05,834
- What friend?
- Ilsa Lund.

1237
01:30:06,002 --> 01:30:09,597
That ought to put your mind to rest
about my helping Laszlo escape.

1238
01:30:09,772 --> 01:30:11,797
The last man I want to see in America.

1239
01:30:12,041 --> 01:30:15,238
You didn't come here to tell me this.
You have the letters of transit.

1240
01:30:15,411 --> 01:30:18,574
You can fill in your name and hers
and leave anytime you please.

1241
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:21,376
Why are you still interested
in what happens to Laszlo?

1242
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:25,782
I'm not. But I am interested
in what happens to Ilsa and me.

1243
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:27,990
We have a legal right to go,
that's true...

1244
01:30:28,157 --> 01:30:31,684
...but people have been held in Casablanca
in spite of their legal rights.

1245
01:30:31,861 --> 01:30:35,228
- What makes you think we want to hold you?
- Ilsa is Laszlo's wife.

1246
01:30:35,398 --> 01:30:38,094
She probably knows things
that Strasser would like to know.

1247
01:30:38,267 --> 01:30:39,791
Louis, I'll make a deal with you.

1248
01:30:39,969 --> 01:30:43,496
Instead of this petty charge against him,
you could get something big...

1249
01:30:43,673 --> 01:30:46,938
...something that would chuck him
in a concentration camp for years...

1250
01:30:47,109 --> 01:30:49,703
- Be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
- Certainly.

1251
01:30:49,879 --> 01:30:52,040
Germany--
Vichy would be very grateful.

1252
01:30:52,248 --> 01:30:53,272
Then release him.

1253
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:56,077
You be at my place a half-hour
before the plane leaves.

1254
01:30:56,252 --> 01:30:58,777
I'll have Laszlo come there
to pick up the letters...

1255
01:30:58,988 --> 01:31:01,582
...and that'll give you grounds
to make the arrest.

1256
01:31:01,858 --> 01:31:04,156
You get him, and we get away.

1257
01:31:04,327 --> 01:31:07,228
To the Germans,
that last will be just a minor annoyance.

1258
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:10,228
There's still something about this
I don't quite understand.

1259
01:31:10,433 --> 01:31:13,129
Miss Lund, she is very beautiful, yes...

1260
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:15,634
...but you were never interested
in any woman.

1261
01:31:15,805 --> 01:31:18,433
- She isn't just any woman.
- I see.

1262
01:31:19,041 --> 01:31:21,441
How do I know you'll keep
your end of the bargain?

1263
01:31:21,611 --> 01:31:24,478
I'll make the arrangements now
with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.

1264
01:31:24,647 --> 01:31:29,107
I'm gonna miss you. You're the only one
in Casablanca who has less scruples than I.

1265
01:31:29,385 --> 01:31:30,647
Oh, thanks.

1266
01:31:31,287 --> 01:31:32,379
Go ahead, Ricky.

1267
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:36,957
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go.
I don't want them around this afternoon.

1268
01:31:37,126 --> 01:31:39,458
I'm taking no chances, Louis,
not even with you.

1269
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:49,629
Should we draw up papers,
or is a handshake good enough?

1270
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:53,070
Certainly not good enough.
But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.

1271
01:31:53,376 --> 01:31:56,709
To get out of Casablanca and
go to America... You're a lucky man.

1272
01:31:56,913 --> 01:32:02,317
My agreement with Sam is that he gets
25 percent of the profits. That still goes.

1273
01:32:02,485 --> 01:32:05,283
I happen to know he gets 10 percent.
But he's worth 25.

1274
01:32:05,454 --> 01:32:08,423
Abdul, Carl and Sascha,
they stay with the place or I don't sell.

1275
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:11,058
Of course.
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.

1276
01:32:11,227 --> 01:32:12,558
Well, so long.

1277
01:32:12,728 --> 01:32:15,754
Don't forget you owe Rick's
100 cartons of American cigarettes.

1278
01:32:15,932 --> 01:32:18,423
I shall remember to pay it to myself.

1279
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:56,132
- You're late.
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel...

1280
01:32:56,305 --> 01:32:57,602
...so I knew I'd be on time.

1281
01:32:57,773 --> 01:33:00,799
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
- He won't be followed here.

1282
01:33:00,977 --> 01:33:03,070
This place will never be
the same without you.

1283
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:06,806
I know what you mean. But I've spoken
to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.

1284
01:33:06,983 --> 01:33:09,713
- Is everything ready?
- I have the letters right here.

1285
01:33:09,885 --> 01:33:12,080
When we searched the place,
where were they?

1286
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:13,414
Sam's piano.

1287
01:33:14,156 --> 01:33:16,090
Serves me right for not being musical.

1288
01:33:16,359 --> 01:33:17,383
Here they are.

1289
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:19,622
You better wait in my office.

1290
01:33:29,338 --> 01:33:31,932
Victor thinks I'm leaving with him.
Haven't you told him?

1291
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:34,542
- Not yet.
- But you were able to arrange everything?

1292
01:33:34,710 --> 01:33:36,075
Everything is quite all right.

1293
01:33:36,245 --> 01:33:39,271
We'll tell him at the airport.
The less time to think, the easier.

1294
01:33:39,448 --> 01:33:41,279
Please trust me.

1295
01:33:43,319 --> 01:33:44,547
Yes, I will.

1296
01:33:49,759 --> 01:33:53,855
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Save it. We've still lots of things to do.

1297
01:33:55,665 --> 01:33:58,759
- I brought the money.
- Keep it, you'll need it in America.

1298
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,068
- But we made a deal.
- Never mind that.

1299
01:34:01,237 --> 01:34:04,536
- You won't have any trouble in Lisbon?
- No. It's all arranged.

1300
01:34:04,707 --> 01:34:07,039
Good. I've got the letters here,
made out in blank.

1301
01:34:07,209 --> 01:34:09,643
All you have to do is fill
in the signatures.

1302
01:34:09,812 --> 01:34:11,211
Victor Laszlo.

1303
01:34:11,747 --> 01:34:14,477
Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest.

1304
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:21,079
The charge of accessory to the murder of the
couriers from whom the letters were stolen.

1305
01:34:21,691 --> 01:34:24,922
You're surprised about my friend Ricky?
The explanation is simple.

1306
01:34:25,127 --> 01:34:28,096
Love, it seems,
has triumphed over virtue. Thank--

1307
01:34:28,898 --> 01:34:33,335
Not so fast, Louis. Nobody is going
to be arrested. Not for a while yet.

1308
01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:35,493
- Have you lost your mind?
- I have. Sit down.

1309
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:37,798
- Put that gun down.
- I don't want to shoot you...

1310
01:34:37,973 --> 01:34:39,838
...but I will if you take one more step.

1311
01:34:40,543 --> 01:34:42,773
Under the circumstances,
I will sit down.

1312
01:34:46,015 --> 01:34:49,507
- Keep your hands on the table.
- I wonder if you realize what this means.

1313
01:34:49,685 --> 01:34:51,812
I do. We've got time to discuss that later.

1314
01:34:51,987 --> 01:34:53,579
Call off your watchdogs, you said.

1315
01:34:53,756 --> 01:34:56,384
Just the same, call the airport
and let me hear you tell them.

1316
01:34:56,559 --> 01:34:58,959
And remember,
this gun is pointed right at your heart.

1317
01:34:59,128 --> 01:35:01,221
That is my least vulnerable spot.

1318
01:35:08,771 --> 01:35:10,830
Hello? Is that the airport?

1319
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:13,802
This is Captain Renault speaking.

1320
01:35:14,009 --> 01:35:16,569
There'll be two letters of transit
for the Lisbon plane.

1321
01:35:16,746 --> 01:35:18,543
There's to be no trouble about them.

1322
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:19,970
Good.

1323
01:35:20,416 --> 01:35:21,576
Hello?

1324
01:35:26,689 --> 01:35:28,088
My car, quickly!

1325
01:35:29,759 --> 01:35:30,851
This is Major Strasser.

1326
01:35:31,026 --> 01:35:33,494
Have a squad of police meet me
at the airport at once.

1327
01:35:33,662 --> 01:35:34,959
At once, do you hear?

1328
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:44,129
Hello, radio tower?

1329
01:35:44,306 --> 01:35:47,400
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes,
east runway.

1330
01:35:47,676 --> 01:35:50,144
Visibility, 1 1/2 miles.

1331
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:54,248
Light ground fog.
Depth of fog approximately 500.

1332
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:57,146
Ceiling unlimited. Thank you.

1333
01:36:09,665 --> 01:36:12,395
Have your man go with Laszlo
and take care of his luggage.

1334
01:36:12,568 --> 01:36:14,331
Certainly, Rick, anything you say.

1335
01:36:14,537 --> 01:36:17,938
- Find Laszlo's luggage. Put it on the plane.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:36:18,107 --> 01:36:19,096
This way, please.

1337
01:36:20,976 --> 01:36:24,104
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

1338
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:26,305
You think of everything, don't you?

1339
01:36:26,482 --> 01:36:28,916
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

1340
01:36:29,118 --> 01:36:32,679
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

1341
01:36:32,855 --> 01:36:34,447
I don't understand.
What about you?

1342
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,716
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

1343
01:36:36,892 --> 01:36:38,883
No. What has happened?
Last night you said--

1344
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:40,858
Last night we said a great many things.

1345
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,930
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

1346
01:36:43,098 --> 01:36:45,760
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

1347
01:36:45,935 --> 01:36:48,597
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

1348
01:36:48,771 --> 01:36:50,602
Now, you've got to listen to me.

1349
01:36:50,773 --> 01:36:53,674
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

1350
01:36:53,843 --> 01:36:57,142
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

1351
01:36:57,313 --> 01:36:59,577
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

1352
01:36:59,748 --> 01:37:03,184
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

1353
01:37:03,385 --> 01:37:05,615
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

1354
01:37:05,788 --> 01:37:08,154
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

1355
01:37:08,324 --> 01:37:11,191
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

1356
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:14,885
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

1357
01:37:15,764 --> 01:37:17,857
But what about us?

1358
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:19,432
We'll always have Paris.

1359
01:37:19,602 --> 01:37:22,594
We didn't have-- We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

1360
01:37:23,005 --> 01:37:24,666
We got it back last night.

1361
01:37:25,574 --> 01:37:29,340
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

1362
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:31,335
But I've got a job to do too.

1363
01:37:31,547 --> 01:37:35,278
Where I'm going, you can't follow.
What I've got to do you can't be any part of.

1364
01:37:35,885 --> 01:37:37,409
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

1365
01:37:37,586 --> 01:37:41,044
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

1366
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:43,919
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

1367
01:37:44,093 --> 01:37:46,618
Someday you'll understand that.

1368
01:37:47,796 --> 01:37:49,559
Now, now.

1369
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,498
Here's looking at you, kid.

1370
01:38:08,651 --> 01:38:11,142
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

1371
01:38:11,387 --> 01:38:13,514
There's something you should know.

1372
01:38:13,756 --> 01:38:15,553
I don't ask you to explain anything.

1373
01:38:15,724 --> 01:38:18,818
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

1374
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:20,859
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

1375
01:38:21,030 --> 01:38:23,897
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

1376
01:38:24,066 --> 01:38:27,502
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

1377
01:38:27,937 --> 01:38:29,165
Yes.

1378
01:38:29,338 --> 01:38:31,363
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

1379
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:35,067
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

1380
01:38:35,244 --> 01:38:37,769
But that was all over long ago.

1381
01:38:37,947 --> 01:38:41,212
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

1382
01:38:41,717 --> 01:38:43,344
I understand.

1383
01:38:43,519 --> 01:38:45,714
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

1384
01:38:46,422 --> 01:38:48,219
I appreciate it.

1385
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:50,854
Welcome back to the fight.

1386
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,585
This time I know our side will win.

1387
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:09,470
Are you ready, Ilsa?

1388
01:39:11,347 --> 01:39:12,712
Yes, I'm ready.

1389
01:39:15,851 --> 01:39:17,216
Goodbye, Rick.

1390
01:39:18,087 --> 01:39:19,987
God bless you.

1391
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:24,019
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

1392
01:39:42,077 --> 01:39:44,011
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

1393
01:39:44,179 --> 01:39:47,012
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

1394
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:48,513
What you just did for Laszlo.

1395
01:39:48,684 --> 01:39:51,084
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

1396
01:39:51,253 --> 01:39:53,585
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

1397
01:39:53,789 --> 01:39:55,814
But she knew you were lying.

1398
01:39:55,991 --> 01:39:57,925
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

1399
01:39:58,093 --> 01:40:02,393
I suppose you know this isn't going to be
pleasant for either of us. Especially for you.

1400
01:40:02,564 --> 01:40:06,056
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

1401
01:40:13,108 --> 01:40:17,442
- What was the meaning of that phone call?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

1402
01:40:20,015 --> 01:40:22,108
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

1403
01:40:22,284 --> 01:40:24,309
Ask Monsieur Rick.

1404
01:40:26,622 --> 01:40:29,455
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

1405
01:40:29,658 --> 01:40:32,923
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

1406
01:40:34,897 --> 01:40:36,455
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

1407
01:40:36,632 --> 01:40:38,497
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down!

1408
01:40:53,549 --> 01:40:55,107
Major Strasser has been shot.

1409
01:40:59,888 --> 01:41:02,516
Round up the usual suspects.

1410
01:41:26,248 --> 01:41:29,911
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist,
but you've become a patriot.

1411
01:41:30,085 --> 01:41:32,246
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

1412
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:34,651
I think perhaps you're right.

1413
01:41:59,448 --> 01:42:03,145
It might be a good idea for you
to disappear from Casablanca for a while.

1414
01:42:03,318 --> 01:42:05,752
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

1415
01:42:05,921 --> 01:42:09,721
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

1416
01:42:09,958 --> 01:42:11,186
I could use a trip.

1417
01:42:11,393 --> 01:42:14,658
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

1418
01:42:14,897 --> 01:42:17,798
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

1419
01:42:17,966 --> 01:42:19,194
"Our" expenses?

1420
01:42:20,035 --> 01:42:24,233
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
