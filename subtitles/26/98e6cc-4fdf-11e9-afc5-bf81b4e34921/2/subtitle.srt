1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,700
Any more cakes? Hand them over!

2
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:20,485
Make it quick!
You're driving me crazy!

3
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,453
I've forgotten to tell you one thing,

4
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,122
If I get vampire teeth, remember,

5
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,460
Kill me at once!

6
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,590
At once.

7
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,177
No! No!

8
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,485
Don't die!

9
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,253
Don't leave me alone!

10
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:49,266
I promise, I'll be your best partner.

11
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,230
I'll listen to you!
I won't fight with your sister again.

12
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:58,336
Wake up, please!

13
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,213
Do you want me to tell you everything?

14
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,076
I really love you!

15
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,386
Can you hear me?

16
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,494
I'm alive!
But I don't know what you just said.

17
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,467
What? What is it?

18
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:39,313
I said... I am not that easy to kill.

19
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,780
I couldn't hear what you said.

20
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:43,923
It's just too noisy.

21
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:49,428
Okay, I'll shut up!
Let's take a rest now.

22
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:02,334
Your cake is really delicious.

23
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,634
Your coffin is so comfortable.

24
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,169
Bye!

25
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,572
Are you looking for trouble?

26
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,282
That kiss was okay,

27
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,611
but you're not allowed
to kiss me again.

28
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:47,215
What you said before...

29
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,648
I heard everything!

30
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,897
Is anyone home?

31
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,691
Miss Momoko,
what a coincidence to see you here.

32
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:04,463
Mr. Prada,
I've brought you some papers to sign.

33
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,935
And I've brought you something else.

34
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,631
Please wait.

35
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,268
This is the last chance!
I'll bite her neck.

36
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,469
And you can choose
any position you like.

37
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,807
Pulse, or inner thigh, or an armpit.

38
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,644
Let's bite her together,
and then suck her blood.

39
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:22,577
I told you many times! I don't suck.

40
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,519
Okay, I'll suck her blood
and put it into a jar.

41
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,096
I'll serve you
with a glass of it, okay?

42
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,495
You used to serve it like that to me.

43
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:41,698
But that's all over now.

44
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,675
Forget the past!

45
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,308
I'm telling you for the last time.
I won't suck blood.

46
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,924
I see! You have fallen for that girl.

47
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,816
Tell me, you think

48
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,860
you're fit to be a vampire?

49
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:05,828
Have you got
what it takes to be a prince?

50
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,956
Are you qualified
to succeed the throne?

51
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,125
Are you giving me a lecture?

52
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,759
Try to tell her tomorrow,
tell her that you're a vampire.

53
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,304
See if she's generous enough
to give you her blood.

54
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,213
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is it urgent?

55
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,554
I want to tell you what I am.

56
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:35,051
Don't turn your back to me.
I'll get angry.

57
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,822
Let me be frank.
I am not a human being.

58
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,027
You're certainly not acting like one!

59
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,270
How can you talk to me like that?

60
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,732
I'm a vampire.

61
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,366
So?

62
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,206
Look at my eyes.

63
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,874
Cool!
Where did you get those contact lens?

64
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,919
What are you yelling about?

65
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,583
See? I want to suck your blood!

66
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:12,528
That's not the right way to suck.
Suck like this.

67
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,393
Let me go! Off!

68
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,405
I know what you're doing!

69
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:25,943
You want to dump me, right?

70
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,678
I'm a vampire!

71
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,544
Do you want
to fall in love with a vampire?

72
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,075
So what's a vampire?

73
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:36,188
Can a vampire brush
his girl off like this?

74
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:41,593
I know! You think I'm too sassy.

75
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,389
But most of the girls

76
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,657
in Hong Kong are sassy!

77
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,261
Don't you believe me?
Go find another one.

78
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,395
If you dare!

79
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,873
I have some dogs at home.

80
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,175
I don't mind having a vampire.

81
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,480
The only problem is
that my brother may not like you!

82
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,954
I am a vampire,

83
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:18,627
and a useless vampire, too.

84
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,064
What do you mean?

85
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,504
I haven't eaten for days!

86
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,136
What are you doing?

87
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,679
I am taking you to find food.

88
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:52,629
You stay here!
It's better for me to go alone.

89
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,262
Be careful!

90
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,142
It's time to eat.

91
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,246
Something's wrong, let's run!

92
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,473
Did you get caught?

93
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,782
Can you hear that?

94
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,213
What is it?

95
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:21,648
Bats.

96
00:10:21,821 --> 00:10:24,984
If there are bats around,
it means vampires are around, too.

97
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,148
Let's run!

98
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,946
Why is the hospital alarm ringing?

99
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,584
Has there been a robbery?

100
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,881
I think it's just a mistake.

101
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,284
I don't think any thief would be
stupid enough to steal from a hospital.

102
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,154
Who knows? Thieves are everywhere.

103
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,227
Your car could even get stolen.

104
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,256
Speak of the devil!

105
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,525
What's the matter?

106
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,828
Who are you?

107
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,970
I am so glad to see you again!
I saved you last time.

108
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,663
Would you help us now?

109
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,374
Your friend is dying!

110
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,341
That's right! I think he's dying!

111
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,276
He has to get to another hospital!
Please take him there now.

112
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,403
But I have to take
something to the hospital.

113
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,948
The "something"
you have to take is him.

114
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,517
Take him there now, or he'll die!

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,449
Come on! Hurry!

116
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,214
Let's go! Please!

117
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,401
Are you feeling bad?

118
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,440
Do you want to suck my blood?

119
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,371
Of course not!

120
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,342
I can treat your teeth
like mosquitoes!

121
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,212
If you don't eat, you'll die!

122
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,802
Jackie, drive faster please.

123
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,835
What's up?

124
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,471
Who are these guys?

125
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,096
Help!

126
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,302
Be careful!

127
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,804
I don't know how to drive!

128
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,614
Hold the wheel tightly!

129
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,731
This is bad!

130
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,127
Are you okay?

131
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,402
What the hell are you?

132
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,166
This is terrible! I ran someone over!

133
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,802
Vampires! They are vampires!

134
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:16,737
Vampires?

135
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:21,577
He can fly!

136
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,083
Come on up!

137
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,155
- Throw me another bag of blood!
- Okay!

138
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,153
It's working! This is type AB.

139
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,112
Are there really vampires?

140
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,856
It works!

141
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,166
What did you give them?

142
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,274
It's a kind of tranquilizer.
It should calm them down.

143
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,133
They ate so much!

144
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,608
It's making them go crazy!
Turn on the music now.

145
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,431
Drink it.

146
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,637
Come on! I brought it for you!

147
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,079
Do you feel better?

148
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,258
Well...

149
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,223
Jackie asked me to return it to you.

150
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,527
What does this mean?

151
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:40,870
The ring is too tight!
I can't get it off.

152
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:14,232
Good morning.

153
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,566
Good morning!

154
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:48,637
You help my brother
to iron his clothes?

155
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,267
I'll iron them from now on.

156
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:57,381
Congratulations!
You've found someone you can love.

157
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:58,540
Haven't you fallen in love
with someone too?

158
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,643
He's great. He's just terrific.

159
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:07,720
But sometimes,
he's not that good to me...

160
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,023
The harder it is to fall in love
with him, the more I love the feeling!

161
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:17,368
Anyway, there is something missing!
So I just couldn't fall in love.

162
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,770
What's missing?

163
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,905
That is...

164
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,373
What is it?

165
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,173
Something is missing...

166
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,248
He is the "thing" you
and my brother hate most.

167
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,085
Have you fallen in love
with a vampire?

168
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,595
But he's a good vampire!

169
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,628
Vampires suck blood and kill people!
How can that be good?

170
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,667
He'd rather starve than suck blood.

171
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,361
He is really nice!

172
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:59,210
Could you say something on our behalf?

173
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,912
Your brother and I
are vampire hunters.

174
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:10,414
Please help us! Please.

175
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,421
I beg you to help us!

176
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,184
My dear sister-in-law!

177
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,421
Come on! Please help me,
"my dear sister-in-law"!

178
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,433
We are a family!

179
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:32,175
Family! As your sister-in-law,
I'll help you, right?

180
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:36,111
I always said my brother is lucky!

181
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,738
At the first sight,

182
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:41,910
I could tell you were really nice
as well as pretty.

183
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,147
Hey,
how did you win my brother's heart?

184
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,088
Watch this!

185
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,952
Superstar!

186
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:55,865
Can you do that?

187
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:57,400
It's terrible!

188
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,867
But your brother likes it.

189
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:03,873
No way! He's got special tastes!

190
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:07,467
He likes trashy girls,
but they must be simple.

191
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:11,174
Besides being simple,
she must be ordinary.

192
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,883
Do you have any better suggestions?

193
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:18,616
Does it work?

194
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,321
How about this?

195
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,526
Can you do that again?

196
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,125
My dear sister-in-law!

197
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,376
Do you have a date?

198
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:40,905
What do you think?

199
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,845
You put on perfume!

200
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:05,901
We can go now.

201
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,938
Do you like it?

202
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:22,152
How pathetic to find
a vampire living here,

203
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:24,255
in a church!

204
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,956
Now, where is the fifth prince?

205
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,573
This is for you.

206
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:52,772
What is it?

207
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,146
Why is it black?

208
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,821
Vampires wear black wedding gowns.

209
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:58,923
Really?

210
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,243
Well, you search over there,

211
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,046
and I'll check over here.

212
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,555
Why should I go there?

213
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:47,833
What are you doing? Let go!

214
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:49,099
Don't you love me?

215
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:51,074
Why did you let them go?

216
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,268
They're in love!

217
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,907
That's my sister,
and that's a vampire!

218
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,107
What did we swear

219
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,376
before joining the League?

220
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,415
When I took my oath,

221
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,609
I didn't fall in love.

222
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,311
Now, I know what love is!

223
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:04,978
Once you love a person,
you won't care about anything.

224
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,784
You can tell that from
what I'm wearing.

225
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,998
Didn't you promise
you'd do anything for me?

226
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,192
I've got it! I'll wait for you here!

227
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:20,560
Reeve,
right where you are least expected!

228
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,624
Good to see you again, old friend.

229
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,477
This is my room.

230
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,076
This is my bed.

231
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:17,018
May I lie down?

232
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,488
Just for sleeping?

233
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:26,856
Go ahead,
well, it's good to take a nap.

234
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:31,394
Our beds are not just for sleeping.

235
00:29:31,536 --> 00:29:34,630
See, it's bigger than yours.

236
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,201
Are there other ways to use it?

237
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,471
Such as?

238
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:45,105
Well, chatting!
Many people love chatting in bed.

239
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,749
Haven't you ever heard of
"pillow talk"?

240
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:52,489
No. Shall we try now?

241
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:54,616
Sure!

242
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,099
Why don't you talk?

243
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,067
What's up?

244
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,500
Someone's here!

245
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:14,945
My dear sister-in-law, you're home!

246
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:20,108
Come with me now!

247
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,153
What's up?

248
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,618
Your brother is in trouble!

249
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,718
He's the only one person
who can save your brother.

250
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:50,780
Kazaf, how long have I waited
for this moment?

251
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,121
I didn't come for you. Let Reeve go.

252
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:01,749
You still dare to act like royalty?

253
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:07,025
Bow to me,
and I may grant you an easy death.

254
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,194
You still need my blood,

255
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:11,630
If I spill it myself,

256
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,499
it's worthless to you,

257
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,172
Let him go.

258
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:16,940
Why should I?

259
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,839
Your friends have already
gone to rescue Reeve.

260
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:27,249
Perhaps,
I should free this one instead?

261
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,263
Reeve!

262
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:52,400
Drop the knife and he shall be free.

263
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,333
No chance! Release him!

264
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,215
No...

265
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:17,994
Let him go!

266
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,717
Reeve!

267
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,016
Reeve! It's me!

268
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:29,125
I'm your sister, Helen!

269
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,180
So I see you are
stronger than your brothers!

270
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:47,969
Reeve!

271
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,971
Reeve!

272
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,385
Gypsy!

273
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:05,061
In this world,
there are still some vampires.

274
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:08,287
And there are
three more vampire hunters.

275
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,123
One of them is me.

276
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:13,293
One is my sister-in-law,
who's now become a semi-vampire.

277
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:17,271
And the other one
is a sentimental vampire!

278
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:06,289
I've brought you something to eat.

279
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:09,355
Come on, try some!

280
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,489
I really love to eat!

281
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,368
So, go ahead.

282
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:27,234
I've brought you some papers.

283
00:52:27,844 --> 00:52:29,709
Take a look, see whether
you've got any questions.

284
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,347
I can do the amendments for you.

285
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:34,147
I think something is wrong.

286
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,619
What's the problem? Just tell me.

287
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,158
You're disgusting!

288
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,668
I feel so itchy!

289
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,059
Do you always act like that?

290
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:19,986
Do you always act like that?

291
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,290
I haven't tried that before.

292
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,669
Honey, I told daddy that

293
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,967
you're "dickson"...

294
00:53:32,109 --> 00:53:33,906
It should be decent.

295
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:35,941
You're "dickson"

296
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,741
I just wanted to speak faster.
I am sorry.

297
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,940
Decent.

298
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,509
Again.

299
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:45,552
No way, I have to deliver
something to the hospital.

300
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,213
Look at his hand!

301
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:49,223
His hand is right here.

302
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,719
No!

303
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:51,759
I said that's you,

304
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,726
you don't have to move like that.

305
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,525
I don't know.

306
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,131
You can just put it here.
