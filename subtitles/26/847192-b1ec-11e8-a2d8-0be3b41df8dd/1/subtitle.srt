You're in some motel room.

You just-- You just wake up,

There's the key. It feels like maybe
it's the first time you've been there,

things go and how the system works.

My wife called me Lenny.

Insurance. I was an investigator.

00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,968
I'd investigate the claims

know if I've met them before.

and try and figure them out.

was just to let them talk...

and the body language.

and they draw conclusions.

That's how you investigate.
It's what I used to do.

It can change the color of a car.

Nothing conclusive, but Sammy can't
remember anything for more than
a couple of minutes.

as long as he learned them
before the accident...

on what he was doing.

in my research: conditioning.

Sammy should still be able

It's how you learn stuff
like riding a bike. You just
get better through practice.

His own wife couldn't deal with it.

I told you about how she tried
to get him to snap out ofit.

to see me at the office.

Sammy, how she treated him.
- Thank you for seeing me.

689
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:03,696
It got to the point where
she'd get Sammy to hide food
all around the house...

690
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,532
and then she'd stop feeding him
just to see if his hunger...

would make him remember
where he'd hidden the food.

She just wanted old Sammy back.

Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy
and you've decided that he's faking.

say the right thing,

- Then why am I here?
- I don't know. Tell me.

980
01:24:19,804 --> 01:24:22,098
I don't remember. I have no
short-term memory. It's not amnesia.

981
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:25,018
- Oh, you're the memory guy.
- How Do you know about me?

982
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:27,562
My boyfriend told me about you.

983
01:24:27,645 --> 01:24:31,566
- Yeah? Who's your boyfriend?
- Jimmy Grants. Do you know him?

984
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:34,194
No.

985
01:24:34,277 --> 01:24:37,739
Well, he knows you.
He told me about you.

986
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:39,908
He said you were staying
at the Discount.

987
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:43,328
In fact, a cop came by here
earlier looking for you.

988
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:46,122
Said he was looking for a guy
who can't remember anything,
wouldn't know how he got here...

989
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:48,124
or what he'd done.

990
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:50,335
Said I get a lot of guys
around here like that.

991
01:24:50,418 --> 01:24:53,880
Well, you know, chronic alcoholism is
one cause of short-term memory loss.

992
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:58,676
- are you Teddy?
- No. My name is Leonard.

993
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,887
- Did Teddy send you?
- I don't know.

994
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:05,183
- What's happened to Jimmy?
- I don't know that either.

995
01:25:05,225 --> 01:25:07,602
- Sorry.
- You don't remember anything?

996
01:25:07,685 --> 01:25:11,064
You don't remember where
you've been or what you've just done.

997
01:25:11,105 --> 01:25:14,734
No. I can't make new memories.
Everything just fades.

998
01:25:14,818 --> 01:25:17,529
- Then why did you come here?
- I found this in my pocket.

999
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,618

- No, thanks.
- It's for a lot of money.

[Man Laughing]

1008
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:37,442
It's completely fucked
because nobody believes you.

1009
01:26:37,525 --> 01:26:40,778
It's amazing what
a little brain damage
will do for your credibility.

1010
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,656
I guess it's some kind of poetic
justice for not believing Sammy.

1011
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:46,659
You know the truth
about my condition, officer?

1012
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:48,828
You don't know anything.

1013
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:51,080
You feel angry,
you don't know why.

1014
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:54,834
You feel guilty,
you have no idea why.

1015
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:57,337
You could do anything and not have
the faintest idea ten minutes later.

1016
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,381
Like Sammy. I could have
done something like Sammy.

1017
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,636
I didn't tell you-- what happened
to Sammy and his wife?

1018
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,679
Well, she came
to see me at my office.

1019
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:08,681
I thought she was just
trying to catch me off guard,

1020
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,684
so I didn't tell her
what I really thought, but
I never said that he was faking,

1021
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:13,686
just that his condition
was mental, not physical.

1022
01:27:13,728 --> 01:27:16,689
I found out later that she went home
and gave Sammy his final exam.

1023
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,361
Sammy?
It's time for my shot.

1024
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:40,421
She knew beyond a doubt
that he loved her.

1025
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:42,924
So she found a way
to test him.

1026

01:27:55,186 --> 01:27:58,773

H m m.

1029
01:28:08,741 --> 01:28:12,620
- She really thought
she'd call his bluff,.
- There you go.

1030
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:17,792
Or she just didn't wanna
live with the things
she put him through.

1031
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:31,389
Sammy.
I t's time for my shot.

1032
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,313
I t won't hurt.

1033
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:26,569
She went into a coma
and never recovered.

1034
01:29:26,652 --> 01:29:30,865
- Sammy couldn't understand
or explain what happened.
- Oh!

1035
01:29:30,948 --> 01:29:32,992
He's been in a home ever since.

1036
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:36,454
He doesn't even know
that his wife's dead.

1037
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:39,957
I was wrong about Sammy,
and I was wrong about his wife.

1038
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:41,959
She wasn't interested in the money.

1039
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,170
She just needed
to understand his problem.

1040
01:29:44,253 --> 01:29:47,757
His brain didn't respond to
conditioning. But he wasn't a con man.

1041
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,177
And when she looked into his eyes, she
thought he could be the same person.

1042
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:53,679
when I looked into his eyes,
I thought I saw recognition.

1043
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,848
Now I know. You fake it.

1044
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,851

somebody, you just pretend to.

You bluff, it to get a pat
on the head from the doctors.

to seem less ofa freak.

plenty of tattoo parlors up north.

checked you into the Discount Inn.

telling you shit, slipping
envelopes under your door.

Sometimes you don't
answer the phone,

under your door to scare you
into answering the phone again,

how his operation's run.

01:41:13,525 --> 01:41:16,862
- I've got this memory thing.
Do I know you?
- No. Don't worry. I'm a cop.

1138
01:41:16,945 --> 01:41:20,240
- Is he still breathing?
- I don't know. Maybe.

1139
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:22,326
What the hell were you guys
doing down here?

1140
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:25,370
Well, I don't remember.
I have this condition.

1141
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:28,832
well, I hope it's not as serious
as his, 'cause this guy's dead.

1142
01:41:28,874 --> 01:41:31,919
Ouch! Lenny!
That shit kills!

1143
01:41:32,002 --> 01:41:35,047
- So you remember me now, huh?
- You are a fuckin' cop.

1144
01:41:35,130 --> 01:41:37,508
Yeah. And I'm the guy
that helped you find him.

1145
01:41:37,549 --> 01:41:39,551
Get up. Get up.

1146
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:42,054
Lenny, you got the wrong idea.

1147
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:46,809
Who is that? He knew me.

1148
01:41:46,892 --> 01:41:49,520
Of course he did. He raped your wife.
He fucked up your brain.

1149
01:41:49,603 --> 01:41:51,647
Bullshit.
He's not the guy.

1150
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:56,068
His name is James F. Grants.
John G. Check your tattoos.

1151
01:41:56,151 --> 01:41:59,571
- What was he bringing
the two hundred grand for?
- What?

1152
01:41:59,655 --> 01:42:02,950
- What was it for?
- A load of amphetamines
I told him I had.

1153
01:42:03,033 --> 01:42:06,745
- Is this a drug deal?
- No. Yeah, that and your thing.

1154
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:08,747
Look, Leonard,
Jimmy's your guy.

1155
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:11,291
- I just figured we'd make
a few dollars on the side.
- How did he know me?

1156
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,919
The Discount Inn.
He dealt out of there.

1157
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:17,297
The guy at the front desk let him know
if anybody came snooping around.

1158
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:19,424
He called Jimmy the minute he saw you
taking a picture of the dump.

1159
01:42:19,508 --> 01:42:22,386
- You're fucking using me.
- No! You get half!

1160
01:42:22,469 --> 01:42:25,097
He knew about Sammy! Why would
I tell him about fuckin' Sammy?

1161
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:28,559
You tell everybody about Sammy,
everybody who'll listen.

1162
01:42:28,642 --> 01:42:30,769
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"
"Remember Sammy Jankis?"

1163
01:42:30,853 --> 01:42:33,772
Great story. It gets better
every time you tell it.

1164
01:42:33,856 --> 01:42:36,650
So you lie to yourself
to be happy.

1165
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:38,777
There's nothing wrong with that.
We all do it.

1166
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,989
Who cares if there's a few little
details you'd rather not remember?

1167
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:46,785
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- I don't know.

1168
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:50,247
Your wife's
surviving the assault.

1169
01:42:50,289 --> 01:42:54,251
Her not believing your condition.
The torment and pain and anguish...

1170
01:42:54,293 --> 01:42:56,962
tearing her up inside.

1171
01:42:57,045 --> 01:42:59,548
The insulin.

1172
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:02,342
That's Sammy, not me.
I told you about Sammy.

1173
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,429
Yeah, right. like you tell
yourself over and over again.

1174
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:07,514
Conditioning yourself
to remember.

1175
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:10,183
- Learning through repetition.
- Sammy let his wife kill herself.

1176
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:15,314
- Sammy ended up in an institution.
- Sammy was a con man, a faker.

1177
01:43:15,397 --> 01:43:17,608
I never said
that Sammy was faking.

1178
01:43:17,649 --> 01:43:20,819
You exposed him
for what he was-- a fraud.

1179
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,780
But I was wrong.
That's the whole point.

1180
01:43:23,822 --> 01:43:27,117
- See, Sammy's wife came to me.
- Sammy didn't have a wife.

1181
01:43:29,828 --> 01:43:32,998
It was your wife
who had diabetes.

1182
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:41,131
Ouch.

1183
01:43:41,214 --> 01:43:43,842
My wife wasn't diabetic.

1184
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,844
You sure?

1185
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:54,811
- Ouch. Cut it out.
- She wasn't diabetic.

1186
01:43:54,895 --> 01:43:58,982
You think I don't know my own wife?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1187
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:02,527
Well, I guess I can only make you
remember the things you wanna be true.

1188
01:44:02,569 --> 01:44:04,988
- Like old Jimmy down there.
- He's not the right guy.

1189
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:07,199
He was to you.

1190
01:44:07,282 --> 01:44:09,701
Come on. You got your revenge.
Enjoy it while you still remember.

1191
01:44:09,785 --> 01:44:13,288
what difference does it make
whether he was your guy or not?

1192
01:44:13,372 --> 01:44:15,499
- I t makes al I the difference.
- Why? You're never gonna know.

1193
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:18,919
- Yes, I will. I will.
- No, you won't.
- Somehow I'll know.

1194
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:21,421
- You won't remember!
- When it's done, I will know.
It'll be different.

1195
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:24,591
Well, I thought so too. In fact,
I was sure ofit, but you didn't!

1196
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:31,473
That's right.
The real John G.

1197
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:34,810
I helped you find him over
a year ago. He's already dead.

1198
01:44:34,893 --> 01:44:38,689
- Don't lie to me anymore.
- Look, Lenny.

1199
01:44:38,730 --> 01:44:41,608
I was the cop assigned
to your wife's case. I believed you.

1200
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:44,236
I thought you deserved
a chance for revenge.

1201
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:47,322
I'm the one that helped you
find the other guy in your
bathroom that night,

1202
01:44:47,406 --> 01:44:50,033
the guy that cracked your skull
and fucked your wife.

1203
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:52,577
We found hi m.
You killed him.

1204
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:59,584
But you didn't remember.
So I helped you start looking again,

1205
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:01,878
looking for the guy
you already killed.

1206
01:45:01,962 --> 01:45:04,214
Oh, yeah. So who was he?

1207
01:45:04,297 --> 01:45:06,717
Just some guy. I mean,
does it even matter who?

1208
01:45:06,758 --> 01:45:11,304
No reason, Lenny. No conspiracy.
Just bad fucking luck.

1209
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:16,601
Couple of junkies too strung out
to realize your wife didn't live alone.

1210
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:21,732
But when you killed him, I was
so convinced that you'd remember.

1211
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:24,276
But it didn't stick.

1212
01:45:24,359 --> 01:45:26,570
Like nothing ever sticks.
Like this won't stick.

1213
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:35,162
I took that picture...
just when you did it.

1214
01:45:37,914 --> 01:45:40,333
Look how happy you are.

1215
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:42,919
I wanted to see
that face again.

1216
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,797
- Oh, gee, thanks.
- Fuck you.

1217
01:45:45,881 --> 01:45:49,634
I gave you a reason to live, and
you were more than happy to help.

1218
01:45:49,718 --> 01:45:53,930
You don't want the truth.
You make up your own truth.

1219
01:45:53,972 --> 01:45:55,932
Like your police file.

1220
01:45:55,974 --> 01:45:59,311
It was complete when I gave it to you.
Who took out the 12 pages?

1221
01:45:59,394 --> 01:46:02,397
- You, probably.
- No, it wasn't me. See, it was you.

1222
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:05,025
- Why would I do that?
- To create a puzzle
you could never solve.

1223
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:08,195
Do you know how many--
how many towns?

1224
01:46:08,278 --> 01:46:10,447
How many John G's
or James G's?

1225
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:12,574
I mean, shit, Lenny,
I'm a fucking John G.

1226
01:46:12,657 --> 01:46:15,952
- Your name is Teddy.
- My mother calls me Teddy.

1227
01:46:15,994 --> 01:46:17,996
My name's
John Edward Gammell.

1228
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,998
Cheerup.

1229
01:46:20,082 --> 01:46:22,834
There's plenty of John G's
for us to find.

1230
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,799
All you do is moan.

1231
01:46:28,882 --> 01:46:30,842
I'm the one that has to live
with what you've done.

1232
01:46:30,926 --> 01:46:32,844
I'm the one that put it
all together.

1233
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:37,641
You, you wander around, you're playing
detective. You live in a dream, kid.

1234
01:46:37,682 --> 01:46:40,685
A dead wife to pine for.
A sense of purpose to your life.

1235
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:45,190
A romantic quest that
you wouldn't end even if
I wasn't in the picture.

1236
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:49,653
- I should kill you.
- Quit it. Lenny, come on.

1237
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:53,657
You're not a killer.
That's why you're so good at it.

1238
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:59,037
Come on. What are you doing?
You know what time it is?

1239
01:46:59,121 --> 01:47:01,206
It's beer o'clock.
I'm buying.

1240
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:05,168
Fuck.

1241
01:47:14,427 --> 01:47:16,763
[Thinking]
I'm not a killer.

1242
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:20,308
I'm just someone who wanted
to make things right.

1243
01:47:25,230 --> 01:47:28,567
Can I just let myself forget
what you've told me?

1244
01:47:45,041 --> 01:47:48,420
Can I just let myself forget
what you made me do?

1245
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,436
You think I just want
another puzzle to solve?

1246
01:48:04,519 --> 01:48:07,397
Another John G. to look for?

1247
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:09,774
You're a John G.

1248
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:14,321
So you can be my John G.

1249
01:48:22,287 --> 01:48:25,582
Do I lie to myself to be happy?

1250
01:48:25,624 --> 01:48:29,002
In your case, Teddy,

1251
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,755
yes, I will.

1252
01:48:43,225 --> 01:48:45,727
Hey! Hey, that's not your car!

1253
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:48,939
- It is now.
- Jesus Christ, you can't take it!

1254
01:48:48,980 --> 01:48:51,316
- Why not?
- Because the guy
you just killed owns it!

1255
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:54,319
Somebody'll recognize it!

1256
01:48:54,402 --> 01:48:59,115
You know, I think I'd rather be
mistaken for a dead guy than a killer.

1257
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:02,452
I might hang on
to this for a while.

1258
01:49:02,535 --> 01:49:07,040
- Lenny. Look, don't--
- Will you help me find the keys?

1259
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:10,126
Help me find my keys.

1260
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,170
Lenny!

1261
01:49:18,843 --> 01:49:20,387
Lenny!

1262
01:49:32,482 --> 01:49:35,777
[Thinking] I have to believe
in a world outside my own mind.

1263
01:49:35,860 --> 01:49:38,029
I have to believe that
my actions still have meaning,

1264
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:41,074
even if I can't remember them.

1265
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:44,577
I have to believe
that when my eyes are closed,

1266
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:47,080
the world's still here.

1267
01:49:48,290 --> 01:49:50,667
Do I believe
the world's still here?

1268
01:49:53,628 --> 01:49:56,172
Is it still out there?

1269
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:00,051
Yeah.

1270
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:05,181
We all need mirrors
to remind ourselves who we are.

1271
01:50:07,559 --> 01:50:09,269
I'm no different.

1272
01:50:21,823 --> 01:50:23,533
Now, where was I?

1273
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:35,837
# we layin each other's arms? #

1274
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:42,719
# But the room
is just an empty space #

1275
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:45,889
# I guess we lived it out #

1276
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:49,601
# Something in the air #

1277
01:50:49,684 --> 01:50:55,482
# we smile too fast then can't
think ofa thing to say #

1278
01:50:56,858 --> 01:50:59,652
# Lived with the best times #

1279
01:51:01,780 --> 01:51:04,032
# Left with the worst #

1280
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:10,413
# I've danced with you
too long #

1281
01:51:13,124 --> 01:51:16,127
# Nothing left to save #

1282
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:22,050
# There's something
in the air #

1283
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:26,137
# Something in my eye #

1284
01:51:26,221 --> 01:51:33,895
# I've danced with you
too long, yeah #

1285
01:51:33,978 --> 01:51:38,316
# Something in the air #

1286
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:44,030
# Something in my eye #

1287
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:56,918
# Abracadoo #

1288
01:51:57,001 --> 01:51:59,170
# I lose you #

1289
01:52:00,839 --> 01:52:03,800
# we can't avoid the clash #

1290
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:06,010
# The big mistake #

1291
01:52:07,637 --> 01:52:10,265
# Now we're gonna pay and pay #

1292
01:52:11,933 --> 01:52:17,730
# I guess you know I never
wanted anyone more than you #

1293
01:52:18,898 --> 01:52:21,985
# Lived all our best times #

1294
01:52:24,487 --> 01:52:26,865
# Left with the worst #

1295
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:33,413
# I've danced with you
too long #

1296
01:52:35,832 --> 01:52:38,460
# Say what you will #

1297
01:52:38,543 --> 01:52:46,301
# But there's something
in the air #

1298
01:52:46,384 --> 01:52:48,928
# Something in my eye #

1299
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:56,019
# I've danced with you
too long #

1300
01:52:56,102 --> 01:53:00,648
# There's something
I have to say #

1301
01:53:00,732 --> 01:53:05,195
# There's something
in the air #

1302
01:53:05,278 --> 01:53:10,325
# Danced with you too long? #
