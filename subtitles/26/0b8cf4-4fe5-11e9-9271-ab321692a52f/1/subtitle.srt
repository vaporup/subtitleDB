1
00:01:18,168 --> 00:01:20,102
Nanny, what's with the young miss?

2
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:22,202
Such innovative style?

3
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:24,396
Just spicing up the routine

4
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:27,007
We've been here
at least 100 times this month

5
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:29,304
It gets boring
she needs stimulation

6
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,621
Make way... make way!

7
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:44,985
Make way!

8
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:48,194
Oh no! It’s her again!

9
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:51,594
You can't see me...

10
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,702
None of these fortune tellers
are any good and it stinks

11
00:01:54,871 --> 00:01:55,530
Foo, right?!

12
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,169
Yes, ma'am

13
00:01:59,743 --> 00:02:01,370
Let's just go home

14
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,642
Hey, Chan

15
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,081
Still trying to set me up?

16
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:16,348
You're just too picky

17
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:17,890
Sit...

18
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,198
These beauties are all
from out of town

19
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:26,858
Have a nice chat

20
00:02:28,071 --> 00:02:30,039
Miss, what's your profession?

21
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:31,537
I'm an escort,

22
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:34,802
But I don't worry, I don't do sex

23
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:36,342
So what do you do?

24
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,413
Drinking games!

25
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:41,049
I do sex, but no games

26
00:02:41,217 --> 00:02:42,980
I'm now looking for an exclusive client

27
00:02:43,186 --> 00:02:44,983
I'm a bona fide lady

28
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:47,248
Can you elaborate?

29
00:02:48,224 --> 00:02:51,057
Well, I don't wash dishes

30
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,420
I don't do any housework

31
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:53,084
You sure you work at all?

32
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,494
Sir, what do you do?

33
00:02:54,764 --> 00:02:56,356
A question for me?

34
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,629
I'm a poet

35
00:02:58,868 --> 00:03:00,335
How does a poet make a living?

36
00:03:00,503 --> 00:03:01,561
By publishing

37
00:03:01,805 --> 00:03:03,534
How many books have you published?

38
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:05,372
None... yet

39
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:07,633
So, you're really a bum?

40
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,442
Remember to invite me to your funeral!

41
00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:11,909
I'll definitely be there!

42
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:14,410
You're too picky

43
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,312
How will you get a wife?

44
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:29,829
Let me do the introduction!

45
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,726
No, we kids can take care of ourselves

46
00:03:34,237 --> 00:03:37,832
Bro, even you're better looking
than he is

47
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:41,235
Not by much, it's just the hair

48
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:45,505
Who are you?

49
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:47,946
I'm her brother,

50
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,948
Also known as Beijing's Best Dressed

51
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,211
Super Double Blades...

52
00:03:53,256 --> 00:03:54,348
Brave heart...

53
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:56,288
Stop! Can't possibly remember all that

54
00:03:57,193 --> 00:04:00,128
Good! Straightforward!
I dig your style!

55
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:01,461
Cheers

56
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:06,234
What's your name?

57
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:07,458
Flying Cloud

58
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:08,897
Any alias?

59
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,094
Spiderman!

60
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:14,441
I like you!

61
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:15,833
Cheers!

62
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:19,645
Why Spiderman?

63
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,781
Cause it sounds cool

64
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:23,483
Good! Fair enough!

65
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,812
I like you, too! Bottoms-up!

66
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:33,920
Miss Liu, am I suitable?

67
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:39,193
You're strong, talented...

68
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:42,428
funny and macho...

69
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:44,095
a natural leader...

70
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:46,266
Overall, a pretty good catch

71
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:48,441
Keen observations. Well said

72
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:50,809
But this entourage...

73
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,845
to bring all these bodyguards...

74
00:04:53,116 --> 00:04:55,641
it feels like an invasion
not a courtship

75
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:58,718
My boys are my best advisers

76
00:04:59,656 --> 00:05:02,489
You need advise in picking a wife?

77
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:04,317
For reference

78
00:05:04,527 --> 00:05:06,722
You're suspicious, paranoid
and indecisive

79
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:09,863
Bad-tempered
probably have sleeping disorders

80
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:12,567
You're brave but indecisive

81
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:14,703
You've got a lot of bodyguards...

82
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:17,567
which shows that you're really a coward

83
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:20,572
I'll marry you right now

84
00:05:20,777 --> 00:05:21,801
Look, who's indecisive now?!

85
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:23,069
Marry me?

86
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:24,941
What do you love about me?

87
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,776
Eh... can't find the words...

88
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,042
I just want to get close to you

89
00:05:30,253 --> 00:05:31,845
Not close enough for you?

90
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,249
How close do you want to get?

91
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,718
Skin to skin, if you know what I mean

92
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,293
Over tea? You outta of mind?

93
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,430
Check please

94
00:05:46,236 --> 00:05:47,498
Ms. Moth Liu

95
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:51,433
Thank you, six dollars

96
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,403
She's paying. She asked for the check

97
00:06:03,853 --> 00:06:04,877
Bottoms up!

98
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:07,118
Good luck...

99
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,349
finding a man who'll have you...

100
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:10,918
BITCH!

101
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,492
You sonofagun!

102
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:19,826
Fat spider! I'll squash you

103
00:06:20,203 --> 00:06:22,034
I'll never marry you. Fat Spider!

104
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:24,901
Fat Spider!

105
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:36,017
Sir, your sister is in trouble...

106
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:37,778
Help her!

107
00:06:38,288 --> 00:06:39,118
Let's wait and see

108
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,122
Her temper will get her killed
one day

109
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:44,360
Maybe he's the man to subdue her

110
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,133
Damn!

111
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:02,400
Mister, lend me your washboard

112
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,791
Stop!

113
00:07:56,532 --> 00:07:57,499
Stop!

114
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:19,279
Looks like blood will be shed today

115
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:25,019
Hey, stop messing around

116
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:26,751
I can squash you with a finger...

117
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:28,956
but if you hold me hostage...

118
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,961
maybe we can force my sister
to marry you

119
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,465
Take my blade and gently slash me...

120
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:35,466
she'll have to say yes to save me

121
00:08:35,672 --> 00:08:36,798
See, I'm really on your side

122
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:42,578
Ms. Moth Liu!

123
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:45,177
If you don't marry me
I'll kill your brother

124
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:48,146
Sis, he risks his life for you

125
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,750
He really loves you!

126
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,214
I'll slaughter him now!

127
00:08:54,457 --> 00:08:55,685
Hey! That's a deep cut!

128
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,692
Sorry, I got too excited

129
00:08:57,894 --> 00:09:01,022
Sis, listen! These may be my last words

130
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,159
True love is hard to find

131
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,198
When love comes knocking, you can't...

132
00:09:06,335 --> 00:09:07,495
Sir, let's stop the bleeding first

133
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,432
I'm OK!

134
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:16,443
Sis, calm down!

135
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,114
There'll always be someone better but...

136
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,874
it's really time you settle down...

137
00:09:21,084 --> 00:09:23,348
and marry someone like Spiderman here

138
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,953
What are you talking about?

139
00:09:25,088 --> 00:09:26,885
He's an ass. I'll never marry him!

140
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,782
Even if you're not ready to settle down

141
00:09:29,025 --> 00:09:30,583
at least set him down

142
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,491
Dear Ms. Hercules...

143
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:39,866
don't mind me

144
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:43,937
The scenery up here is fantastic

145
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,333
in fact, I'm enjoying the cool breeze

146
00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,337
I'm not in a hurry, take your time

147
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,639
It’s getting a bit stuffy

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,286
Excuse me... it... sounds like

149
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,082
I may fall soon!

150
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:38,522
Are you marrying me or not!

151
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:45,059
The country is at war...

152
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,699
and you able-body warriors...

153
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,402
are killing each other...

154
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:50,195
Personal vendettas
when your country is at war

155
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:53,375
Have you no shame?

156
00:10:53,576 --> 00:10:54,838
The heavens is...

157
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,170
weeping at your folly!

158
00:10:58,214 --> 00:11:00,944
What are you mumbling about?

159
00:11:02,084 --> 00:11:04,678
Put simply, what I'm saying...

160
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:06,650
We're being invaded and
instead of fighting the enemies...

161
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,087
you're here killing each other instead

162
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,316
Say, if your mom asks you to study...

163
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:11,925
would you go play football instead!

164
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:12,822
Where's your priority!

165
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,290
Defeating the true enemy...

166
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,963
that's real courage

167
00:11:16,966 --> 00:11:18,092
I understand now

168
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:23,261
How dare you drag my mom into this...
want to die?

169
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:25,368
You're so dumb!

170
00:11:25,608 --> 00:11:28,099
You ignorant pig.
He's trying to explain

171
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,705
Mr. Cloud! Stop...

172
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,971
First:
It’s obvious you're not her man

173
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:35,082
Second:
This scholar is sabotaging our plan

174
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,785
I wonder what his motives are...

175
00:11:36,986 --> 00:11:37,850
Third:
...

176
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:41,646
I'm bleeding to death! It’s over

177
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:44,618
I'm fainting...

178
00:11:45,895 --> 00:11:48,955
The country needs me. I'm going!

179
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,098
Sir, thanks for your advise!

180
00:11:52,401 --> 00:11:53,766
See you!

181
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,336
Hope not!

182
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,070
When will there be peace again?

183
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:05,543
What happened to brotherly love?

184
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,440
What's your name?

185
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,207
Last name's Chan

186
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,887
Parents liked the seasons

187
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:14,516
Spring Chan?

188
00:12:14,757 --> 00:12:16,054
Seasonal Chan!

189
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,956
And you?

190
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:21,193
Last name's Liu. My mother liked...

191
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,193
moths to flames

192
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,557
Flaming Liu?

193
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:26,692
Moth Liu!

194
00:12:26,903 --> 00:12:28,234
Pleased to meet you!

195
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:30,436
Pleasure's all mine

196
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,430
Obviously

197
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,903
Your words...

198
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,669
are more convincing than my fists

199
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:39,641
I'm impressed

200
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,610
I'm more than a man of words

201
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,582
I'm a philosopher, too

202
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,489
I'm off, see you again soon

203
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,994
Come see for yourself!

204
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,829
The latest autographed
Poet Soo poster

205
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,594
They're authentic signatures

206
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,238
Who else has a beard like that?

207
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:06,668
Take your time, calm down...

208
00:13:07,176 --> 00:13:09,303
Let go of my hand

209
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,809
Soo, I love you!

210
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:13,072
Come see for yourself!

211
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,783
Calm down, take your time...

212
00:13:16,652 --> 00:13:18,745
Look at you, your mascara is running

213
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,748
Miss, do I look terrible?

214
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:22,049
No, no, you've got style

215
00:13:22,325 --> 00:13:24,293
Soo'll be impressed

216
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:25,755
But Soo doesn't even know me

217
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,256
I'd be impressed if he does

218
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:48,074
Your idol must be an incredible man

219
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:49,682
Wow, even the Emperor's here

220
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:55,383
Cousin!

221
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,216
Cousin Long, what're you doing here?

222
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:00,485
Soo's a pal and I'm the event sponsor

223
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,526
Ladies and gentlemen!

224
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,601
The Valentino of poetry!

225
00:14:13,542 --> 00:14:16,636
Sponsored by Long Far Pharmaceuticals

226
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:21,340
Let the Love Forever Reading...

227
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,016
begin!

228
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,834
Soo Tung Bo!

229
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,214
Soo Tung Bo!

230
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:01,748
How're you doing!

231
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,286
Good!

232
00:15:03,492 --> 00:15:04,186
And you!

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,454
- And you!
- Great!

234
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:12,500
- And you!
- Great!

235
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:16,135
Friends in the back!

236
00:15:18,974 --> 00:15:23,001
Sipping wine and

237
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,716
Waiting for the moon

238
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:32,343
don't know when...

239
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:36,924
I dream of...

240
00:15:37,626 --> 00:15:41,926
riding on the wind...

241
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:46,691
lonely is the night...

242
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:51,335
dancing in the dark...

243
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:55,838
with shadows around me...

244
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,572
feels like heaven...

245
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:11,584
sleepless is the night

246
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:13,920
no hate...

247
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,657
just regrets howling at moon...

248
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,365
Soo, I love you!

249
00:16:21,504 --> 00:16:24,302
If only your love is forever...

250
00:16:26,175 --> 00:16:30,441
that love will conquer all...

251
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,340
the future is unpredictable...

252
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,494
Wow, what a group

253
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:47,261
Even the Emperor is here!

254
00:16:47,696 --> 00:16:49,357
A round of applause for my friend

255
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,762
The special guest of the evening
Seasonal Chan!

256
00:17:08,884 --> 00:17:09,908
Are you scared?

257
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:11,915
Not if you're not

258
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:13,143
Need a drink?!

259
00:17:13,322 --> 00:17:14,289
No

260
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,421
I think you've got something to say

261
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:23,459
In a small village in the west,

262
00:17:23,632 --> 00:17:24,564
there's a group of destitute students,

263
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,631
they don't even eat desk...

264
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:30,498
I mean... have desks...

265
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,868
Shut up!

266
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:37,104
Go home!

267
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,870
They really need your support...

268
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:41,047
Seasonal Chan, take a hike!

269
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:44,480
They believe that knowledge
can change their lives...

270
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,618
They're starving

271
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:50,324
I composed a song and
wrote the lyrics myself

272
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,651
For these children in need

273
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,226
I hope they'll be fed

274
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:55,962
Hurry up!

275
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:02,134
Maybe I'll do this another day...

276
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:05,200
The stage is all yours

277
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
Thank you

278
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,745
A feast in the palace to honor me

279
00:19:53,982 --> 00:19:56,473
Your majesty, I love you!

280
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,324
Seasonal Chan

281
00:20:14,336 --> 00:20:15,360
Good evening

282
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,497
You were fantastic!

283
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:20,802
That was a disaster

284
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,000
perhaps, maybe...

285
00:20:23,245 --> 00:20:24,872
Maybe my style is too post-modernist

286
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:26,978
to understand

287
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:29,650
Did you understand my performance?

288
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:31,677
Sure

289
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:35,219
Your words were from your heart.
I feel it

290
00:20:35,391 --> 00:20:37,154
Your style is creative and alternative

291
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:39,624
One day, they'll learn
to appreciate your talent!

292
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:42,925
You flatter me!

293
00:20:50,906 --> 00:20:53,431
I found something unique in your work

294
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:55,337
There's innocence, depth...

295
00:20:55,644 --> 00:20:58,545
and meaning

296
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:00,644
If you work harder

297
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,577
One day, they'll love it, too!

298
00:21:46,161 --> 00:21:48,595
The perfect match...
go get married!

299
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,397
Sure, a good match!

300
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:56,862
You howling your crazy songs

301
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:59,005
And she waving her crazy glowing stick

302
00:21:59,141 --> 00:21:59,732
my head's still spinning from it

303
00:22:00,008 --> 00:22:00,906
The perfect odd couple

304
00:22:01,143 --> 00:22:01,939
Perfectly odd!

305
00:22:02,244 --> 00:22:04,644
Perfectly odd!

306
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,871
I order you to get married!

307
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,548
Your names?

308
00:22:08,851 --> 00:22:09,647
Seasonal Chan!

309
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:10,580
And you?

310
00:22:14,556 --> 00:22:15,648
Moth Liu CHAN!

311
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,340
I'm so lucky...

312
00:22:52,294 --> 00:22:54,125
Miss is back!

313
00:22:56,899 --> 00:22:58,799
Where were you last night?

314
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,524
We're all worried sick!

315
00:23:01,503 --> 00:23:03,903
Got married last night!

316
00:23:04,172 --> 00:23:05,104
To him?

317
00:23:15,017 --> 00:23:16,382
Brother-in-law?

318
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:17,650
Cousin only

319
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:18,682
Brother!

320
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:21,252
What's your name?

321
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:22,081
Chan

322
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:22,780
Chan what?

323
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,582
Seasonal

324
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,451
Got it!

325
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,456
Got what?

326
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:28,796
Thank you for marrying my sister

327
00:23:28,964 --> 00:23:30,454
May the heavens bless you
with good health

328
00:23:30,632 --> 00:23:32,031
Sister sold... no refund, no exchange

329
00:23:32,267 --> 00:23:33,529
Thank you lord!

330
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:36,134
Hey, what's this! Talk to me!

331
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:37,529
Savior...

332
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,431
My cousin married you already

333
00:23:39,608 --> 00:23:40,666
you'll protect her

334
00:23:41,643 --> 00:23:42,735
Sure!

335
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:45,571
You've got to take care of her health

336
00:23:47,082 --> 00:23:50,813
Here are some medicines for her!

337
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:54,147
This will improve her chi!
Guaranteed to work

338
00:23:54,423 --> 00:23:55,481
Make her eat more!

339
00:23:57,593 --> 00:24:01,120
This is for you.
1000-year-old ginseng

340
00:24:01,296 --> 00:24:03,526
You'll need it to survive her beatings!

341
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:06,565
Swallow it and it'll save your life

342
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,735
But...

343
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:11,005
it's too big to swallow!

344
00:24:11,873 --> 00:24:14,774
Ground it, just suck, don't swallow

345
00:24:15,677 --> 00:24:16,166
Come

346
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:18,045
- Sis!
- Bro!

347
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:21,138
- Sis!
- Bro!

348
00:24:21,383 --> 00:24:22,509
Sis!

349
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:23,616
Bro!

350
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:26,686
- Sis!
- Bro!

351
00:24:27,356 --> 00:24:30,519
You're getting on my nerves
what's wrong with you!

352
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,185
You're taking the cook with you

353
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:35,760
Who's gonna make dinner

354
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,465
I panicked...

355
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:41,167
Foo is yours!

356
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:48,666
This is my house

357
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:51,773
Stop, let's get off here

358
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:53,713
Honey, help me down, thanks

359
00:24:56,485 --> 00:24:58,112
My wife!

360
00:25:00,422 --> 00:25:02,686
Seasonal, Seasonal!

361
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:04,516
Come here!

362
00:25:04,893 --> 00:25:06,417
You're finally a star

363
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:10,962
The Emperor blessed your marriage

364
00:25:11,366 --> 00:25:14,199
Can I have your autograph?

365
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:17,564
I love your work, you're great...

366
00:25:29,351 --> 00:25:30,909
Master, welcome home

367
00:25:31,186 --> 00:25:33,552
A woman just landed in our front yard...

368
00:25:39,895 --> 00:25:42,090
Master, who's that?

369
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,060
The mistress!

370
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:44,622
Madame!

371
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,332
Hurry!

372
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:47,995
Good day, madam

373
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:50,171
I'm your butler Wong Choy!

374
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:51,336
Good!

375
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:56,803
Long live your majesty!

376
00:25:57,045 --> 00:26:00,276
Long live your majesty!

377
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:04,178
Impressively trained!

378
00:26:04,553 --> 00:26:05,713
Please rise...

379
00:26:05,954 --> 00:26:07,717
Thank you!

380
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:09,820
Miss, where should we put Baby?

381
00:26:12,794 --> 00:26:14,193
Ma'am,
here's all the household accounts...

382
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:15,225
All the accounts

383
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:16,387
all yours

384
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:17,394
Very good

385
00:26:17,666 --> 00:26:18,826
Thank you, ma'am!

386
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,531
Stop calling me ma'am.
It makes me sound old

387
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:22,633
Call me something else!

388
00:26:24,906 --> 00:26:25,895
Master!

389
00:26:26,108 --> 00:26:28,872
No, my husband is the master
of the house

390
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:31,579
You're She-master and
he'll be He-master

391
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:36,214
Tell me, does he...
have a girlfriend?

392
00:26:36,618 --> 00:26:38,449
He-master says

393
00:26:38,653 --> 00:26:40,416
we're not to speak of his affairs

394
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:41,917
We cannot divulge his secrets

395
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:43,284
Loyalty, I like that!

396
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:44,624
Here's your reward!

397
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:46,287
Thank you, She-master!

398
00:26:47,996 --> 00:26:48,985
I'll leave you, He-master

399
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,031
What's wrong?

400
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:59,295
Will you hit me?

401
00:26:59,541 --> 00:27:01,566
Not unless you did something wrong!

402
00:27:01,777 --> 00:27:04,473
If I do, you must have done
something wrong

403
00:27:04,646 --> 00:27:08,309
What are your definitions of wrong?

404
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:10,414
From now on
you'll love no one but me

405
00:27:10,652 --> 00:27:11,914
You'll spoil me; never lie to me

406
00:27:12,187 --> 00:27:13,415
Fulfil all your promises

407
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:15,349
Always tell me the truth

408
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:18,081
Never argue with me, have faith in me

409
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,023
Protect me, stand up for me

410
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:22,252
Share my laughter

411
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:24,294
Wipe away my tears

412
00:27:24,499 --> 00:27:25,898
Promise that I'll always be only one
in your eyes

413
00:27:26,168 --> 00:27:27,294
The only one in your dream

414
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:28,798
The only one in your heart!

415
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:30,269
Simple enough

416
00:27:31,573 --> 00:27:32,562
Can you do this?

417
00:27:33,475 --> 00:27:34,271
Sure!

418
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:42,641
Look, a beauty

419
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:46,250
Snow White from a distance...

420
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:48,786
Wicked Stepmother up close

421
00:27:53,528 --> 00:27:58,124
Chan, the Club is hosting
a Persian Night soon!

422
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:00,898
You're teasing me?

423
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:05,305
Don't you have errands to run?

424
00:28:05,807 --> 00:28:07,172
You're pushing it

425
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:11,302
This is male bonding time
women should go home

426
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:12,104
Let's drink, brother Soo!

427
00:28:12,414 --> 00:28:13,938
Go home and make dinner!

428
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:18,217
Don't worry

429
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:21,115
We've got a really good cook

430
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:22,817
A sharp tongue

431
00:28:23,091 --> 00:28:25,651
Tame her now or it'll be too late

432
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:28,887
Tong, get the 9th concubine
to come here right away!

433
00:28:31,566 --> 00:28:32,828
9th concubine!

434
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:38,395
Coming! Coming...

435
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,912
What took you so long?

436
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:46,078
I was taking a bath

437
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:47,442
Go home now...

438
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,047
Not bad, come and go as you please

439
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:55,551
Impressive

440
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:57,815
You can do it, too. Try

441
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:11,339
Honey

442
00:29:23,184 --> 00:29:24,310
Please go home

443
00:29:27,055 --> 00:29:29,148
Are you deaf

444
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:32,025
We'll trick her

445
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,257
Are you a man? Where's your dignity!

446
00:29:37,432 --> 00:29:40,196
You can't even stand up to your woman

447
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:42,534
We despise you!

448
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,204
We despise you!

449
00:29:45,674 --> 00:29:47,005
Got it...

450
00:29:47,175 --> 00:29:49,109
Even I despise myself!

451
00:29:49,344 --> 00:29:51,369
I'm not a man

452
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,409
Can you slap me again?

453
00:29:53,648 --> 00:29:55,206
Sure, despicable!

454
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,111
We despise you!

455
00:29:59,654 --> 00:30:02,452
Honey, I'll run along now...

456
00:30:02,657 --> 00:30:04,750
I'll be the perfect wife...

457
00:30:05,126 --> 00:30:07,856
and always give you face

458
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:11,197
I'll go home now
and run really really fast

459
00:30:11,466 --> 00:30:12,933
You have fun

460
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,002
Persian night promotion, 20% off.
Free fruit plates, too

461
00:30:21,176 --> 00:30:21,767
Do they take cards?

462
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:22,466
What kind of cards?

463
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:23,143
Birthday cards!

464
00:30:23,178 --> 00:30:24,270
They'll give you free wine for cards!

465
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:31,475
Cheers!

466
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:33,386
What a treat...

467
00:30:39,828 --> 00:30:41,295
Persian pussy cats!

468
00:30:49,637 --> 00:30:51,366
You're Soo's family?

469
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:53,870
I'll show you and beat you up!

470
00:30:57,979 --> 00:31:03,781
Seasonal Chan!

471
00:31:04,052 --> 00:31:07,021
Seasonal Chan!

472
00:31:08,423 --> 00:31:09,685
Seasonal Chan!

473
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,655
Seasonal Chan!

474
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:13,324
Master Soo!

475
00:31:13,561 --> 00:31:14,687
Where's Seasonal Chan!

476
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:18,763
Brother Soo? What's wrong?

477
00:31:19,034 --> 00:31:21,434
Seasonal, look for yourself
my entire household...

478
00:31:21,636 --> 00:31:23,536
Over twenty of them were beaten up
by your wife

479
00:31:23,772 --> 00:31:25,865
Look what she did!
How do you propose to settle this?

480
00:31:26,207 --> 00:31:26,935
You see for yourself!

481
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,582
Good God...

482
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:28,129
If I slapped you, hit me!

483
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:30,166
Not my wives,

484
00:32:30,371 --> 00:32:32,635
My children, my family!

485
00:32:55,763 --> 00:32:59,961
Sammi...

486
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:04,530
How can you hit a helpless puppy!

487
00:33:04,772 --> 00:33:06,763
Does she have a heart?

488
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:11,139
Brother Soo...

489
00:33:11,379 --> 00:33:13,472
Your wife, your call

490
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:15,340
If you still consider me a friend

491
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:16,845
Give me justice, show me you're a man

492
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,551
Punish her and make her pay!

493
00:33:32,033 --> 00:33:35,730
Why! Why did you do this!

494
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:42,671
Why...

495
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:45,605
Say you're sorry!

496
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,839
If you want me to stop beating you
say...

497
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:52,442
Tell me you're sorry!

498
00:33:59,194 --> 00:34:01,526
Ouch! You're hurting me!

499
00:34:01,763 --> 00:34:02,627
They are innocent

500
00:34:02,864 --> 00:34:04,525
Why did you beat up his family?

501
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,930
Only I can hit you, no one else!

502
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,661
What gives you the right
to beat up others?

503
00:34:09,904 --> 00:34:11,030
Why are you so self-righteous...

504
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:12,398
And I can't punish you?

505
00:34:12,574 --> 00:34:13,598
You're just a bully!

506
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:21,841
Help! Help...

507
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:24,308
Help!

508
00:34:25,887 --> 00:34:27,787
Who do you think you are!

509
00:34:28,356 --> 00:34:32,759
Help! Mom, help!

510
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:36,623
Moth Liu, I'll make you pay
for hurting...

511
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,890
every concubine, every child

512
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,125
and the dog. What do you have to say?

513
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:43,527
Nothing, I didn't do this!

514
00:34:43,738 --> 00:34:45,706
I only kicked down your front door

515
00:34:46,307 --> 00:34:47,638
Are you kidding

516
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,502
I didn't come all the way
in the middle of the night...

517
00:34:49,744 --> 00:34:51,678
to weave a tale for your entertainment

518
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:55,182
You don't frighten me...

519
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:57,748
nor am I the least bit amused

520
00:34:57,952 --> 00:34:59,317
Do you think
I can be so easily bullied?

521
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:01,222
Don't push me!

522
00:35:01,856 --> 00:35:13,097
She beat me up! She beat me up!

523
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:15,666
Now, I'll really give you
a good lashing!

524
00:35:16,037 --> 00:35:17,197
She beat me up...

525
00:35:17,372 --> 00:35:19,067
Honey, calm down!

526
00:35:19,307 --> 00:35:21,104
How?! I'm burning like the torches!

527
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:23,709
Torches don't fuel tempers

528
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:25,139
I'm fuming!

529
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:27,479
I've something to say!

530
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:32,209
Mister and ma'am, I'm sorry!

531
00:35:33,154 --> 00:35:35,816
Me, mister? How old are you?

532
00:35:36,257 --> 00:35:38,555
Abnormal growth hormones...
I'm only 14!

533
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:43,222
What do you want to say?

534
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:45,289
Ma'am didn't hit me!

535
00:35:45,767 --> 00:35:48,759
So what caused your injuries?

536
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:51,002
Auntie...

537
00:35:52,874 --> 00:35:55,138
Hit me when she crashed into the wall!

538
00:35:57,612 --> 00:35:59,170
You're Soo's family!

539
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,506
Creditors!

540
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:03,509
Wrong person!

541
00:36:03,785 --> 00:36:05,582
Uncle went mad and
pushed me to the ground!

542
00:36:06,621 --> 00:36:08,213
Cousin slammed the stool on my head!

543
00:36:16,331 --> 00:36:18,731
We came all the way
in the middle of the night

544
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,164
To frame you

545
00:36:21,602 --> 00:36:23,900
Good boy, honesty is the best policy

546
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,266
Next time, remember to shave
before you go out!

547
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,407
Got it?

548
00:36:26,874 --> 00:36:28,398
Soo

549
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,440
I beat up my wife for nothing

550
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,943
You owe me one

551
00:36:33,247 --> 00:36:34,942
Your wife started all this

552
00:36:35,183 --> 00:36:37,777
Unless she apologizes
our friendship is over!

553
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:40,077
So drastic!

554
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:42,620
My family's looking to me
for justice

555
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,552
Give me face?

556
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,090
OK?

557
00:36:51,432 --> 00:36:53,093
OK! Let the ceremony begin!

558
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,202
You alright?

559
00:37:05,446 --> 00:37:07,414
Silly girl, that's a dangerous spot!

560
00:37:14,722 --> 00:37:16,849
Seasonal Chan! You're a sissy!

561
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,549
Will you promise

562
00:37:20,795 --> 00:37:22,057
you'll never beat up anyone again
especially me?

563
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:23,927
No!

564
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:27,290
Hand me your favorite thrashing rod!

565
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:28,832
No, please

566
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,300
The rod!

567
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:38,406
Honey, the rod

568
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:42,880
So your friends are more important

569
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:43,881
Give me your hand!

570
00:37:45,353 --> 00:37:47,218
One, Two

571
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:49,886
Don't move

572
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:51,180
One

573
00:37:52,527 --> 00:37:54,017
Two, Three

574
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:56,361
Let's go inside!

575
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:58,322
Thank you. Honey!

576
00:37:58,533 --> 00:38:00,160
You'll not to leave the house
without my permission!

577
00:38:00,334 --> 00:38:00,766
That's tough!

578
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:01,557
I hold you responsible
for the He-master!

579
00:38:01,602 --> 00:38:03,229
I swear I'll hit you, too!

580
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:06,502
Help! Help!

581
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:08,174
Close the door first! He-master!

582
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:10,333
Help! Help!

583
00:38:10,678 --> 00:38:11,702
Help! Help!

584
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:44,568
Honey, let's go walk the dog!

585
00:38:48,082 --> 00:38:52,018
Honey,

586
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:53,550
you should read more

587
00:38:53,788 --> 00:38:55,346
Knowledge will give you wings!

588
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,551
Your daddy's so cool!

589
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,067
Go sleep in the bed.
You'll catch a cold

590
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:18,509
Honey

591
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:22,244
Come on...

592
00:39:38,466 --> 00:39:39,455
He-master

593
00:39:40,935 --> 00:39:42,197
Where do you think you are going?

594
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:47,438
Wong, let me go out

595
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:49,768
I need to have some fun!

596
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:54,308
What do you think I am?

597
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:58,418
I'm only loyal to you!

598
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,451
- Wong!
- Master!

599
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:06,185
Are you setting me up?

600
00:40:07,194 --> 00:40:09,059
Master, I'm on your side

601
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:10,457
I've to understand the enemy

602
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:12,495
Gain her trust

603
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,997
Then, I can save your ass

604
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,469
- Wong
- Yes, master

605
00:40:19,707 --> 00:40:22,141
I can't leave you behind and
sneak out alone

606
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:24,277
Why don't you come and
have some fun too

607
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:25,104
Let's go

608
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:27,308
No, you need to stay behind and
watch her

609
00:40:27,515 --> 00:40:28,413
OK, sir

610
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,317
Almost time...

611
00:40:31,218 --> 00:40:33,311
For anaesthesia smoke

612
00:41:03,818 --> 00:41:04,716
Soo!

613
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,614
A hug?

614
00:41:07,822 --> 00:41:09,187
Your wife may hit you for this
aren't you scared?

615
00:41:10,224 --> 00:41:12,454
Yes, but you'll protect me

616
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:15,184
It’s no fun without you!

617
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:17,761
Let's go then

618
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:21,162
Told you he can't resist
the temptation!

619
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,098
Honey,

620
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,370
Wong!

621
00:41:32,913 --> 00:41:35,643
Good morning! She-master!

622
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,080
Good morning! She-master!

623
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:41,983
He-master went to the Club!

624
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:44,850
There are tons of She-Masters
there tonight!

625
00:41:48,863 --> 00:41:49,852
Hey, bottoms-up!

626
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,088
Let's make them drink!

627
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:54,426
- They're so boring; make them drink
- Sure...

628
00:41:54,568 --> 00:41:56,035
We're cool naturally!

629
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:58,000
We can just sip!

630
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:58,969
OK!

631
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,764
Moth Liu is coming!

632
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,539
Moth Liu loves beating everyone up!

633
00:42:05,212 --> 00:42:06,406
Where's she?

634
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,315
Gottcha!

635
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:09,516
It’s not funny!

636
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,183
You're scared away all the girls!

637
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:13,516
It’s not funny!

638
00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:53,722
If it weren't for you
where'd we get all these chicks!

639
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:57,264
You're a pal!

640
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:02,334
Chan...

641
00:43:02,536 --> 00:43:04,128
Where's your girl?

642
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:06,905
Why are you all alone!

643
00:43:07,408 --> 00:43:09,103
I want to go home

644
00:43:09,276 --> 00:43:10,709
I miss my wife

645
00:43:10,978 --> 00:43:12,570
But you're humping!

646
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:13,939
Yeah, so what?

647
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:15,638
I'll find you a check!

648
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:19,443
Too kind of you

649
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:23,514
You look like a beauty!

650
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:25,753
Sit here...

651
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,520
Closer

652
00:43:28,863 --> 00:43:30,592
Stop humping!

653
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:39,071
Nice to knead you

654
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:40,735
Knead me?

655
00:43:45,946 --> 00:43:47,208
What's with you?

656
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:51,915
Let's belly-dance!

657
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:01,853
Moth Liu's here!

658
00:44:02,096 --> 00:44:02,960
Moth Liu?

659
00:44:04,365 --> 00:44:07,198
You're ruining the party...
wait, stop!

660
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:10,494
Sir, are you alright?

661
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:12,035
I'm fine... you run along now

662
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:13,171
Moth Liu is coming

663
00:44:14,008 --> 00:44:15,976
No one is coming

664
00:44:16,844 --> 00:44:18,334
Are you sure?!

665
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,473
Not again?

666
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:26,250
Who's Moth Liu?

667
00:44:26,487 --> 00:44:28,352
Why are you so scared?

668
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:33,121
Drink

669
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,243
I'm spinning

670
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:58,508
Hurry. I wanna...

671
00:45:00,988 --> 00:45:02,353
You bastard! Belly-dance!

672
00:45:03,424 --> 00:45:07,520
Honey, I'm home... sweet dreams

673
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:10,089
Honey...

674
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,859
You screw around and
you miss your wife?

675
00:45:15,102 --> 00:45:16,000
You're getting a good deal!

676
00:45:16,804 --> 00:45:18,169
Sure...

677
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:22,439
I fell in love the first time
I saw you

678
00:45:22,643 --> 00:45:25,806
I knew I would spend the rest of
my life with you

679
00:45:26,747 --> 00:45:29,477
Only you can...

680
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:32,942
Make me a better person

681
00:45:34,154 --> 00:45:35,917
Only...

682
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:41,757
Only if you'd not hit me
or anyone else again...

683
00:45:41,929 --> 00:45:44,830
I'm scared, honey...

684
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:47,333
Honey...

685
00:45:48,535 --> 00:45:51,936
My head's hurting. I'm in pain...

686
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:56,373
Honey...

687
00:45:56,577 --> 00:45:57,669
Honey

688
00:46:03,317 --> 00:46:06,115
Are you really drunk?

689
00:46:06,387 --> 00:46:07,911
Of course I'm drunk

690
00:46:08,322 --> 00:46:13,282
Why else would I confess to you?

691
00:46:13,894 --> 00:46:16,624
Really trashed...

692
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:21,127
Honey, where are you?

693
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:24,462
Right here, right next to you

694
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:28,297
Tired, sleepy...

695
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:29,840
Sleep now, sleep!

696
00:46:52,666 --> 00:46:54,691
Wong, how did I get home last night?

697
00:46:55,769 --> 00:46:56,827
Good morning!

698
00:47:00,674 --> 00:47:02,039
Good morning!

699
00:47:03,978 --> 00:47:06,242
Your outfit... cleaned and ironed!

700
00:47:06,847 --> 00:47:08,337
Burn it, burn it...

701
00:47:10,751 --> 00:47:12,651
Wong, come here

702
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,422
What's up with you?

703
00:47:17,591 --> 00:47:20,651
She-master has ordered me to dance

704
00:47:20,861 --> 00:47:22,590
For the rest of the month

705
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,456
Where's the nearest cliff?

706
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:25,188
Why?

707
00:47:25,432 --> 00:47:26,296
I want to jump off it

708
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,933
Just run for your life!

709
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:31,134
You think I can escape?

710
00:47:39,513 --> 00:47:40,377
Honey!

711
00:47:42,282 --> 00:47:44,113
So healthy... morning exercises!

712
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:46,949
Yes, good for your health!

713
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:54,890
No, no, honey

714
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:57,220
Shut up!

715
00:48:00,601 --> 00:48:01,727
Honey

716
00:48:02,002 --> 00:48:03,731
You like to watch belly-dance?

717
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:04,961
Not really

718
00:48:05,406 --> 00:48:07,033
It’s OK, if you like it...

719
00:48:07,174 --> 00:48:08,801
Wong will perform you during the day

720
00:48:09,009 --> 00:48:11,102
I'd personally perform for you
every night

721
00:48:11,311 --> 00:48:12,835
No, it's OK...

722
00:48:13,747 --> 00:48:15,112
Promise me

723
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:16,816
You'd not mess around again

724
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:18,416
OK...

725
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:20,180
I have faith in you

726
00:48:21,522 --> 00:48:23,820
Finally, one big happy family

727
00:48:24,091 --> 00:48:26,389
Can I make a request, honey?

728
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,786
I'll kill him now!

729
00:48:28,128 --> 00:48:30,756
He-master, stop...

730
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:38,696
His majesty needs your service

731
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,137
Long live his majesty!

732
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,240
Who'll volunteer to test the new drug?

733
00:48:43,777 --> 00:48:45,108
I will!

734
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:47,140
You, come here

735
00:48:47,347 --> 00:48:48,814
Go with the imperial doctor

736
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:58,649
The tests are finished!

737
00:48:59,593 --> 00:49:00,651
Let's have the report

738
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:04,125
This is Lucky

739
00:49:05,466 --> 00:49:07,627
This is Lucky's puppy lover

740
00:49:07,835 --> 00:49:10,269
and now is his wife

741
00:49:10,537 --> 00:49:12,767
They've sworn that

742
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:15,533
They'll always love each other

743
00:49:15,709 --> 00:49:19,577
Lucky's favorite food is his wife's
tea-flavored eggs!

744
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,111
Come, Mrs. Lucky

745
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:27,587
Lucky cannot recognize his wife

746
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:31,121
After drinking the Love Eraser

747
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,256
Lucky...

748
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:34,552
Lucky...

749
00:49:34,728 --> 00:49:37,196
Lucky!

750
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:39,023
Majesty, with this magic drug

751
00:49:39,233 --> 00:49:42,168
Our army will be invincible!

752
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:46,269
Love unites men

753
00:49:46,507 --> 00:49:48,065
Without love

754
00:49:48,342 --> 00:49:50,503
What's there to fight for?

755
00:49:50,978 --> 00:49:54,641
I order this drug be banned forever!

756
00:49:55,782 --> 00:49:57,215
Majesty, what wisdom!

757
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:06,425
Watch it, it hurts...
It’s good for you

758
00:50:06,593 --> 00:50:07,423
Bro, what's with you?

759
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:10,857
I walked into a bank robbery

760
00:50:11,064 --> 00:50:12,429
I'm fine, I'm fine

761
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:13,826
Really?

762
00:50:14,001 --> 00:50:15,628
But, don't you have
to make a delivery today?

763
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:17,834
Yeah

764
00:50:21,742 --> 00:50:23,437
Honey

765
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,009
Honey

766
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:27,773
You're another's wife and
you still have to work for me

767
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:29,539
I feel bad

768
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:33,044
Honey, I'll be back soon

769
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:34,584
Three days, I promise

770
00:50:35,255 --> 00:50:36,085
Hurry!

771
00:50:42,629 --> 00:50:43,323
Honey!

772
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:45,660
Honey!

773
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,391
The sun is setting

774
00:50:55,809 --> 00:50:58,607
Honey, while you're gone
I'll write a book

775
00:50:58,812 --> 00:51:00,803
When you come back
you'll be the first to read it

776
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:01,810
What's your theme?

777
00:51:02,482 --> 00:51:03,506
A secret

778
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:09,086
You've seen my family jade charm

779
00:51:09,923 --> 00:51:12,983
Your mom gave it to you?

780
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:14,721
You want to give it to me?

781
00:51:14,962 --> 00:51:17,897
Don't, the charm is to protect you

782
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:22,759
Why don't we split it in half...

783
00:51:23,003 --> 00:51:24,265
And we'll both be protected

784
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:31,243
Mom!

785
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:46,992
It’s OK, it seals our love

786
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,292
I'll be back soon!

787
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:52,790
OK

788
00:52:04,244 --> 00:52:07,907
Ghost story,

789
00:52:56,296 --> 00:52:58,526
Bunny!

790
00:53:01,968 --> 00:53:03,128
Where?

791
00:53:08,175 --> 00:53:10,507
A meek little thing!

792
00:53:16,316 --> 00:53:19,843
Chop, chop, chop. You chop, I chop...

793
00:53:20,087 --> 00:53:22,214
I only invited you to snack

794
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:23,218
Why did you bring...

795
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,287
this scary Taoist monk!

796
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:26,355
He's an old friend

797
00:53:26,526 --> 00:53:29,086
He came for my famous dish
you've a problem?

798
00:53:30,797 --> 00:53:33,493
Bring the rabbit!

799
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:34,927
OK!

800
00:53:45,812 --> 00:53:48,212
Gentle sir

801
00:54:04,898 --> 00:54:07,389
Gentle sir

802
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:09,032
Bunny demon?

803
00:54:09,302 --> 00:54:10,462
The fire's cackling

804
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,296
Bunny demon!

805
00:54:12,506 --> 00:54:13,871
Skin it before you season it

806
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:16,098
I said Demon!

807
00:54:16,443 --> 00:54:18,877
Demon, I'll cook the demon!

808
00:54:22,649 --> 00:54:23,877
Help!

809
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:28,051
Help...

810
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:33,386
Demon...

811
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:39,362
It’s gone...

812
00:54:59,686 --> 00:55:01,483
Stupid, get out of the way!

813
00:55:02,689 --> 00:55:03,747
Help!

814
00:55:03,957 --> 00:55:05,015
Wait for me...

815
00:55:05,926 --> 00:55:07,416
Demon!

816
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:09,489
Help me!

817
00:55:15,502 --> 00:55:17,629
Gentle sir, let me explain...

818
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:20,704
You and I were once deities

819
00:55:20,941 --> 00:55:22,704
You were the God of Virgins

820
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:24,467
I was the Goddess of innocence

821
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:28,412
We were tricked by the God of Peaches

822
00:55:28,715 --> 00:55:31,445
And banished from heaven

823
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:34,176
Zeus took pity

824
00:55:34,387 --> 00:55:35,684
and granted us seven lifetimes

825
00:55:35,956 --> 00:55:37,423
as man and wife

826
00:55:37,791 --> 00:55:40,988
This is the seventh lifetime

827
00:55:41,828 --> 00:55:44,319
If we don't consummate our love,

828
00:55:44,965 --> 00:55:48,765
I'll reincarnate as a dog

829
00:55:50,237 --> 00:55:53,866
Can you not take pity on me?

830
00:55:55,509 --> 00:55:59,468
Sir, it's only a one-night stand

831
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:04,943
But... you're a bunny

832
00:56:05,285 --> 00:56:07,753
Inside and out, from top to bottom

833
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:10,388
I'm a beautiful young girl

834
00:56:10,824 --> 00:56:12,883
Can't you see?

835
00:56:16,296 --> 00:56:18,890
Be gentle to your servant girl

836
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:22,332
After tonight

837
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:25,397
When the sun rises

838
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,306
I'll vanish forever

839
00:56:29,643 --> 00:56:31,770
Never bother you again

840
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,770
Servant girl, the sun's out

841
00:56:59,973 --> 00:57:01,338
Hurry, get out of here

842
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:02,304
Before you vaporize

843
00:57:02,576 --> 00:57:03,941
Shush!

844
00:57:07,147 --> 00:57:08,239
Maids!

845
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:10,013
Maids?

846
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:13,182
What?

847
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:15,515
Good morning, princess!

848
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:16,986
OK, OK, rise!

849
00:57:18,258 --> 00:57:20,158
It’s all because I admire your talent

850
00:57:20,393 --> 00:57:22,486
So I came up with this scheme

851
00:57:24,664 --> 00:57:27,497
If only you're single

852
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:30,067
Then I didn't have to work
this hard to get you

853
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:44,777
You're really the princess?

854
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:49,080
So what about last night?

855
00:57:49,322 --> 00:57:50,789
I'll explain

856
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,457
The breeze was my chi

857
00:57:56,696 --> 00:57:58,220
The demon...

858
00:57:58,398 --> 00:57:59,626
there were five of us

859
00:58:00,634 --> 00:58:02,693
The princess included!

860
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:05,795
Bought the bunny at the market

861
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:10,332
I'd swear we didn't see anything

862
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:25,384
Life in the palace is boring

863
00:58:25,725 --> 00:58:29,388
You artists lead such an exciting life

864
00:58:29,963 --> 00:58:32,523
I really envy you

865
00:58:33,366 --> 00:58:34,390
Safe journey, princess!

866
00:59:00,326 --> 00:59:01,293
Savior!

867
00:59:02,729 --> 00:59:04,492
Brother-in-law, so early?

868
00:59:04,631 --> 00:59:05,689
Surprise!

869
00:59:07,701 --> 00:59:08,599
Honey!

870
00:59:19,012 --> 00:59:20,001
Honey!

871
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,779
Honey, did you miss me?

872
00:59:22,215 --> 00:59:23,341
Of course, honey

873
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:25,517
Missed you so much!

874
00:59:25,652 --> 00:59:27,620
So did she, she really hurried back

875
00:59:27,854 --> 00:59:30,220
She rode all day and all night

876
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:32,482
She hasn't even eaten or showered

877
00:59:32,659 --> 00:59:33,557
Brother!

878
00:59:34,427 --> 00:59:35,985
Skipping a meal may keep you slim

879
00:59:36,196 --> 00:59:37,595
But skipping a shower, take a bath

880
00:59:37,797 --> 00:59:39,287
How about I fix you a bubble bath

881
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,066
Do I stink? Not really

882
00:59:41,234 --> 00:59:42,098
Let me see

883
00:59:44,104 --> 00:59:45,071
Even your sweat is sweet

884
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:47,628
How sweet is it?

885
00:59:49,342 --> 00:59:52,209
Sweet as roses

886
00:59:52,579 --> 00:59:54,479
Honey, don't bathe again!

887
00:59:54,848 --> 00:59:55,610
He-master!

888
00:59:57,217 --> 00:59:58,377
Someone's looking for you!

889
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:07,915
I don't know her,

890
01:00:08,161 --> 01:00:09,560
tell her to go away

891
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:10,761
Close the gate and let the dog out!

892
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:25,742
The dog's out!

893
01:00:29,382 --> 01:00:30,542
Honey, let's go take a bath!

894
01:00:30,717 --> 01:00:32,014
Who's she?

895
01:00:32,986 --> 01:00:34,851
Looks exactly like a kept woman

896
01:00:35,288 --> 01:00:40,157
You really shouldn't have

897
01:00:41,427 --> 01:00:42,485
I've nothing to say

898
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,222
Talk to me

899
01:00:46,132 --> 01:00:47,690
With regards to what happened

900
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:49,562
I have no comments at this time

901
01:00:50,737 --> 01:00:53,331
Please accept my deepest regrets

902
01:00:53,573 --> 01:00:54,369
but I believe...

903
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:56,099
this incident will not change our love

904
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:57,674
over the long run

905
01:00:57,944 --> 01:00:58,842
Tell me!

906
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:02,941
The princess pretended that
she was the bunny demon

907
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:04,275
and tricked me into saving her

908
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:06,008
from reincarnating as a dog

909
01:01:06,886 --> 01:01:08,820
What a fantastic tale!

910
01:01:09,656 --> 01:01:10,850
Did you sleep with her?

911
01:01:15,361 --> 01:01:17,386
Yes or no?

912
01:01:36,482 --> 01:01:39,076
Do you know
what makes marriage sacred?

913
01:01:41,788 --> 01:01:42,812
Keeping your promises

914
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:34,970
Brother...

915
01:04:52,045 --> 01:04:53,740
What crime did you commit?

916
01:04:55,214 --> 01:04:57,546
None of your business, old man!

917
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:59,115
Even if I tell you, can you save me?

918
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:02,716
Neighbors confide in each other

919
01:05:03,656 --> 01:05:05,556
I've done nothing wrong

920
01:05:07,193 --> 01:05:11,061
Nine out of ten say
that they're innocent

921
01:05:11,297 --> 01:05:12,457
Here's one for you:

922
01:05:12,698 --> 01:05:15,792
Compromise and learn to forgive

923
01:05:16,436 --> 01:05:19,633
It’s the only way to be free

924
01:05:20,139 --> 01:05:24,098
And live a happy life

925
01:05:26,145 --> 01:05:28,511
So how long have you been here
Mr. Forgiveness?

926
01:05:30,383 --> 01:05:32,214
Thirty odd years

927
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:35,550
Thirty odd years?

928
01:05:35,788 --> 01:05:37,278
See how compromise has locked you up

929
01:05:39,192 --> 01:05:40,557
It freed you?

930
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:43,244
Moth, the Emperor has punished
the princess

931
01:06:43,523 --> 01:06:45,184
And he has planned some amends

932
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:48,753
I have one good and one bad news

933
01:06:48,928 --> 01:06:52,557
The good news is the princess
will marry Chan as a concubine

934
01:06:52,732 --> 01:06:54,597
You'll still retain your position
as the wife

935
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:57,668
Bad news is you have no say in this

936
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:02,841
Sister, forgive me, some tea

937
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:06,643
Say yes, you can't win every time

938
01:07:06,979 --> 01:07:07,775
You can torture her

939
01:07:08,014 --> 01:07:09,413
after the wedding

940
01:07:09,649 --> 01:07:11,844
Once she's his, she's all yours, too

941
01:07:36,676 --> 01:07:39,474
Moth Liu, the Emperor's own sister
pours you tea

942
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:40,805
and you refuse?

943
01:07:43,849 --> 01:07:45,441
It’s tradition

944
01:07:45,585 --> 01:07:47,576
that a man can marry many

945
01:07:47,853 --> 01:07:50,720
The princess is royalty

946
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:52,083
and she has agreed to be a concubine

947
01:07:52,358 --> 01:07:54,792
and share your housework with you

948
01:07:55,061 --> 01:07:57,427
What more can you ask?

949
01:07:57,863 --> 01:07:59,660
Bend and compromise!

950
01:08:00,967 --> 01:08:03,595
A woman must stay faithful and true

951
01:08:03,836 --> 01:08:05,303
And a man can marry concubines?

952
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:07,898
Is one woman's love not enough?

953
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:12,935
When I go hunting

954
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:14,976
the lion is always accompanied

955
01:08:15,214 --> 01:08:16,511
by a pack of lionesses

956
01:08:16,949 --> 01:08:19,975
I've never seen it otherwise

957
01:08:20,353 --> 01:08:23,345
It’s natural for women to obey men

958
01:08:23,589 --> 01:08:24,647
Not other way around it

959
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:26,915
You compare men with beasts?

960
01:08:27,126 --> 01:08:28,388
Aren't you stretching it?

961
01:08:28,661 --> 01:08:31,596
Miss Liu, look at your husband

962
01:08:31,797 --> 01:08:34,163
He's handsome and talented

963
01:08:34,433 --> 01:08:36,526
He's a woman magnate

964
01:08:36,836 --> 01:08:39,304
Even if you keep the princess out

965
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:42,236
there'll be others, don't you see?

966
01:08:44,777 --> 01:08:48,406
I will fight anyone and everyone

967
01:08:49,548 --> 01:08:52,381
I must accept this fate

968
01:08:52,985 --> 01:08:55,317
He's my husband and this is my duty

969
01:08:56,322 --> 01:08:58,313
Even if I die fighting off other women

970
01:08:58,557 --> 01:09:00,115
I will not complain one bit

971
01:09:01,994 --> 01:09:03,962
Don't worry, your majesty

972
01:09:05,264 --> 01:09:07,255
Moth Liu, I understand

973
01:09:07,466 --> 01:09:09,434
Fearless as you are, fierce as you are

974
01:09:09,602 --> 01:09:11,729
are you not afraid of the emperor?

975
01:09:11,937 --> 01:09:14,405
Sure, I'm afraid.
I must fight for what's mine

976
01:09:15,808 --> 01:09:17,173
Brave girl!

977
01:09:18,544 --> 01:09:19,943
Aren't you afraid of me?

978
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,004
I'm afraid that
you overestimate yourself!

979
01:09:23,282 --> 01:09:24,271
- You...
- Your majesty

980
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,509
I'm afraid that you'll force
your will on me!

981
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:29,417
- Your majesty...
- How dare you!

982
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:31,589
The emperor's furious

983
01:09:32,458 --> 01:09:34,050
Emperor, cool your fury!

984
01:09:42,635 --> 01:09:43,624
Your majesty

985
01:09:45,404 --> 01:09:46,666
Your majesty

986
01:09:48,874 --> 01:09:55,279
Your majesty, calm down...

987
01:09:57,283 --> 01:09:58,272
Brother

988
01:10:06,025 --> 01:10:07,151
Rise

989
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:11,892
OK, get up, get up

990
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:27,841
Shit! The lioness roars!

991
01:11:48,928 --> 01:11:50,862
Insult the emperor and
you'll drink the poison wine!

992
01:11:51,063 --> 01:11:51,927
Your majesty!

993
01:11:52,198 --> 01:11:53,495
It’s really my fault

994
01:11:53,699 --> 01:11:56,224
I'll drink the wine for her!

995
01:11:56,402 --> 01:12:01,396
Emperor is a man of his words

996
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,937
My husband is the emperor

997
01:12:03,142 --> 01:12:04,234
I'll not let her get away with this?

998
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,342
Bring the poison wine!

999
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:09,673
Your majesty
may I have a pen and paper

1000
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:13,544
This woman knows no shame

1001
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:16,415
I'll write the divorce paper myself!

1002
01:12:18,757 --> 01:12:20,987
What did I do...
why are you divorcing me?

1003
01:12:25,364 --> 01:12:27,195
Your worst crime is...

1004
01:12:29,401 --> 01:12:30,663
Loving me!

1005
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:36,999
The Emperor...

1006
01:12:37,176 --> 01:12:39,110
Why turn a wedding

1007
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:41,371
into a disaster?

1008
01:12:42,348 --> 01:12:44,441
If you'll leave Seasonal now

1009
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:46,912
The Emperor will give you
the Love Eraser

1010
01:12:47,152 --> 01:12:50,178
Drink it and you'll forget
the one you love

1011
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:53,222
After you drink it
you'll forget all about him

1012
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:56,361
Drink it

1013
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:59,427
Drink it and
your pains will go away!

1014
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:09,766
It’s better to forget
than to be heartbroken!

1015
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,085
Sister!

1016
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,954
Don't you forget me!

1017
01:13:27,726 --> 01:13:30,126
We just grew up in the same house

1018
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:32,695
I'm not your true love

1019
01:13:33,098 --> 01:13:35,498
Remember me!

1020
01:15:03,656 --> 01:15:06,819
Seasonal Chan, when are you going
to marry the princess?

1021
01:15:08,661 --> 01:15:11,061
If you don't, you'll be beheaded

1022
01:15:11,263 --> 01:15:12,287
straight to the guillotine

1023
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:19,493
I can never marry the princess

1024
01:15:23,942 --> 01:15:25,273
It takes two to tango,

1025
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:26,671
two to fall in love

1026
01:15:32,451 --> 01:15:35,147
Gentle sir, your servant girl
can only hope

1027
01:15:35,454 --> 01:15:37,445
that we'll meet again
in another lifetime

1028
01:15:39,658 --> 01:15:40,522
Thanks

1029
01:15:43,328 --> 01:15:45,853
Moth Liu has forgotten everything

1030
01:15:46,765 --> 01:15:49,825
Go to her, make her love you again

1031
01:15:50,569 --> 01:15:53,163
If you two fall in love again

1032
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:56,266
she'll only remember the good times

1033
01:15:56,775 --> 01:15:57,799
Isn't that swell?

1034
01:16:01,447 --> 01:16:02,345
Thank you

1035
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:05,882
What are you waiting for?

1036
01:17:02,307 --> 01:17:03,365
Good morning!

1037
01:17:05,577 --> 01:17:06,737
Foo, good morning!

1038
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:09,948
Nanny, good morning!

1039
01:17:10,182 --> 01:17:13,447
Baby, good morning!

1040
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:19,115
Why are you all so strange today?

1041
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:22,589
Strange, no way...

1042
01:17:23,362 --> 01:17:25,125
Let's go out for breakfast
my treat

1043
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:26,853
OK!

1044
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:28,794
What shall we do after breakfast?

1045
01:17:29,034 --> 01:17:30,899
Start a fight or something!

1046
01:17:38,644 --> 01:17:39,736
Honey

1047
01:17:41,914 --> 01:17:42,846
Looking for you?

1048
01:17:45,017 --> 01:17:46,143
Moth

1049
01:17:53,592 --> 01:17:54,616
Honey

1050
01:18:17,182 --> 01:18:19,047
Bastard, who're you calling honey

1051
01:18:19,251 --> 01:18:19,945
Do I look like an easy victim?

1052
01:18:20,085 --> 01:18:22,110
No... no...

1053
01:18:22,487 --> 01:18:26,947
You OK? Are you stupid or what!

1054
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:29,286
She drank the Love Eraser.
Why call her honey?

1055
01:18:29,561 --> 01:18:30,721
And you had to give her a brick
to hit you with?

1056
01:18:30,896 --> 01:18:32,761
Not his honey, I'll hit you too!

1057
01:18:33,232 --> 01:18:35,325
Don't talk to these assholes! Go away!

1058
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:36,395
You think this road's yours?

1059
01:18:36,602 --> 01:18:37,569
Yeah, you own this road or what?

1060
01:18:38,237 --> 01:18:39,204
I'll check the deeds right now

1061
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:42,969
Are you OK?

1062
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:06,055
Thanks

1063
01:19:06,265 --> 01:19:07,357
Careful now

1064
01:19:13,272 --> 01:19:14,603
Go!

1065
01:19:20,245 --> 01:19:22,645
We don't like you! Leave now!

1066
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:55,411
Hate you!

1067
01:20:00,085 --> 01:20:01,609
I have a suggestion

1068
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:03,617
Why don't we go to the Club instead!

1069
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:04,813
Yeah!

1070
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:05,979
Up yours!

1071
01:20:06,124 --> 01:20:08,422
Up where? Bring me a mat!

1072
01:20:08,961 --> 01:20:11,623
Art of War says:
Stay still if your enemy's still!

1073
01:20:11,863 --> 01:20:13,262
We'll camp out here

1074
01:20:13,532 --> 01:20:15,227
Together, like fools

1075
01:20:15,434 --> 01:20:16,958
Just sitting here
is not a solution, Soo

1076
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:19,000
But sitting and drinking is

1077
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:20,397
Cheers!

1078
01:20:20,706 --> 01:20:22,503
Cheers!

1079
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:23,436
Sit...

1080
01:20:53,772 --> 01:20:55,501
Sir, please come in

1081
01:21:07,319 --> 01:21:09,480
My brother told me everything

1082
01:21:10,155 --> 01:21:11,679
So we were married

1083
01:21:13,058 --> 01:21:14,753
Since your arrival

1084
01:21:14,926 --> 01:21:16,655
my family's been upset

1085
01:21:17,429 --> 01:21:19,363
They're split into two groups

1086
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:22,795
One group hates you and
my brother leads that faction!

1087
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:28,501
The other thinks you've got a heart

1088
01:21:28,774 --> 01:21:31,641
That's just Foo and Baby...

1089
01:21:32,477 --> 01:21:34,775
I want to put an end to this

1090
01:21:36,081 --> 01:21:37,912
I've decided to get marry ASAP

1091
01:21:38,283 --> 01:21:39,113
What?!

1092
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:41,983
Mr. Tien!

1093
01:21:44,523 --> 01:21:48,482
I was afraid you wouldn't come
with the rain and all!

1094
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,293
Get down! All of you!

1095
01:21:50,929 --> 01:21:53,454
Put your hands on your head!

1096
01:21:54,866 --> 01:21:57,733
Don't move! It’s raining, go home!

1097
01:21:58,003 --> 01:22:01,063
I'd throw this lid at you!

1098
01:22:03,775 --> 01:22:05,242
Stop embarrassing yourself

1099
01:22:05,444 --> 01:22:07,071
Give it up!

1100
01:22:09,114 --> 01:22:10,206
I'll kill you!

1101
01:22:12,417 --> 01:22:15,113
Seasonal...

1102
01:22:23,795 --> 01:22:25,888
Brother, I'll marry him

1103
01:22:27,532 --> 01:22:28,624
Marry me

1104
01:22:32,370 --> 01:22:35,168
So when's the wedding?

1105
01:22:35,774 --> 01:22:37,298
Whatever you say!

1106
01:22:37,576 --> 01:22:38,941
Tomorrow's an auspicious day

1107
01:22:39,377 --> 01:22:41,971
I'm making soup, I need to go home
and watch the stove!

1108
01:22:42,547 --> 01:22:44,447
What kind of soup? Is it ready yet?

1109
01:23:43,742 --> 01:23:45,642
The antidote for the Love Eraser!

1110
01:24:15,807 --> 01:24:17,434
The Emperor's orders!

1111
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:21,436
Long live his majesty!

1112
01:24:28,887 --> 01:24:30,252
Bride, let's go now

1113
01:24:49,007 --> 01:24:53,205
Master Soo, what's taking so long?

1114
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:55,106
The order's coming! It’s coming!

1115
01:25:02,454 --> 01:25:04,388
One order of steamed clams! Eat up!

1116
01:25:05,357 --> 01:25:06,483
Let's go...

1117
01:25:12,764 --> 01:25:13,230
Where's the antidote?

1118
01:25:13,465 --> 01:25:14,159
Here!

1119
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,388
Soo, as a scholar like you

1120
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,158
reduced to such trickery

1121
01:25:17,369 --> 01:25:18,802
they'll make a mockery of you, do you know?

1122
01:25:19,104 --> 01:25:20,731
We poets will die for romance

1123
01:25:20,905 --> 01:25:22,805
Nothing can stop me

1124
01:25:27,846 --> 01:25:28,676
Honey!

1125
01:25:29,681 --> 01:25:30,807
Foo?!

1126
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:32,415
What happened to her?

1127
01:25:32,717 --> 01:25:33,741
What happened?

1128
01:25:34,019 --> 01:25:36,715
Master Tien fell in love with me

1129
01:25:36,888 --> 01:25:37,786
and...

1130
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:38,819
Where's my honey?

1131
01:25:39,057 --> 01:25:41,617
She's hosting a fight to decide

1132
01:25:41,826 --> 01:25:44,420
who she is going to marry

1133
01:25:45,964 --> 01:25:47,955
Seasonal!

1134
01:26:01,112 --> 01:26:01,737
He-master!

1135
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,048
The only antidote

1136
01:26:04,316 --> 01:26:05,681
down the drain

1137
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:21,090
- Moth!
- What do you want?

1138
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,164
Honey!

1139
01:26:24,002 --> 01:26:25,469
Go...

1140
01:26:26,037 --> 01:26:27,004
Honey!

1141
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:29,729
You again?

1142
01:26:29,941 --> 01:26:31,135
Yes, it's me again

1143
01:26:32,744 --> 01:26:34,143
- Honey...
- What are you doing here?

1144
01:26:34,312 --> 01:26:35,176
Haven't you caused her enough pain?

1145
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:35,869
What're doing?

1146
01:26:36,181 --> 01:26:37,512
How can you let her do this?

1147
01:26:37,716 --> 01:26:39,115
What if she gets hurt?

1148
01:26:39,384 --> 01:26:40,180
We thought about it

1149
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:41,909
The men will fight each other, not her

1150
01:26:42,087 --> 01:26:44,146
Whoever wins will win her hand

1151
01:26:44,289 --> 01:26:46,018
The best fighter is not the best lover

1152
01:26:46,224 --> 01:26:48,454
She'll never be happy
with a violent man!

1153
01:26:48,693 --> 01:26:49,455
Agreed!

1154
01:26:49,994 --> 01:26:51,222
And you made her happy?

1155
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:55,795
He-master

1156
01:26:58,136 --> 01:26:59,228
I want to enter the fight

1157
01:26:59,404 --> 01:27:00,098
How many?

1158
01:27:00,305 --> 01:27:01,863
All ten of us

1159
01:27:02,107 --> 01:27:03,039
We do everything together

1160
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:05,106
We even share our wives...
eventually

1161
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:06,601
You're not qualified!

1162
01:27:07,078 --> 01:27:08,443
Can't you bend the rules

1163
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,970
I'm the famous poet Soo Tung Bo!

1164
01:27:10,248 --> 01:27:12,341
So what, I'm the infamous Nanny!

1165
01:27:13,051 --> 01:27:14,211
Beat up the nanny!

1166
01:27:14,386 --> 01:27:15,114
Infamous? We'll show you!

1167
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:17,511
What are you doing...

1168
01:27:29,467 --> 01:27:32,265
All contestants proceed
to the boxing ring

1169
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:37,671
Seasonal He-master

1170
01:27:37,909 --> 01:27:39,809
Don't do it!
Seasonal...

1171
01:27:40,044 --> 01:27:42,376
You'll die, don't go

1172
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:43,444
He-master...

1173
01:27:43,615 --> 01:27:45,173
Seasonal, stop!

1174
01:28:06,404 --> 01:28:08,702
There're simply too many contestants

1175
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:11,706
The organizers have decided
to turn the event

1176
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,208
into a group fight

1177
01:28:15,079 --> 01:28:16,307
There's no time limit

1178
01:28:16,681 --> 01:28:18,911
The last one standing...

1179
01:28:19,150 --> 01:28:21,015
and still standing after
I count to ten

1180
01:28:21,419 --> 01:28:23,114
will marry my sister

1181
01:28:24,222 --> 01:28:25,211
Good!

1182
01:28:47,645 --> 01:28:48,612
What do you want?

1183
01:28:51,483 --> 01:28:52,677
He-master...

1184
01:28:55,253 --> 01:28:56,811
Seasonal, get up!

1185
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:50,267
Seasonal, forget it...
He-master...

1186
01:29:55,647 --> 01:29:59,174
I'm a mango...

1187
01:30:03,187 --> 01:30:05,451
M-a-n-g-o...

1188
01:31:00,111 --> 01:31:02,443
We're supposed to fight or what?

1189
01:31:19,263 --> 01:31:20,355
Stop!

1190
01:31:21,466 --> 01:31:24,902
Illegal gathering.
You can go to jail for this!

1191
01:31:26,604 --> 01:31:28,401
I order you to disperse now

1192
01:31:28,606 --> 01:31:31,370
or face the guillotine!

1193
01:31:38,516 --> 01:31:40,143
I told the emperor

1194
01:31:40,318 --> 01:31:42,650
you kidnapped me and stole the antidote

1195
01:31:42,887 --> 01:31:43,876
No way?

1196
01:31:44,155 --> 01:31:45,019
Yup, I did

1197
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,822
But the emperor came up with this ruse

1198
01:31:48,026 --> 01:31:49,516
to help Seasonal

1199
01:31:50,294 --> 01:31:53,161
Cousin, announce the winner now!

1200
01:31:53,431 --> 01:31:55,865
I still have to count to ten

1201
01:32:14,452 --> 01:32:15,612
One

1202
01:32:18,756 --> 01:32:19,688
One

1203
01:32:21,325 --> 01:32:23,850
Two

1204
01:32:28,132 --> 01:32:29,360
Three

1205
01:32:38,743 --> 01:32:40,540
There's innocence

1206
01:32:40,745 --> 01:32:42,770
and depth in your work

1207
01:32:43,014 --> 01:32:44,538
If you work harder

1208
01:32:44,816 --> 01:32:46,784
one day, they'll see it, too!

1209
01:33:38,569 --> 01:33:40,469
From now on...

1210
01:33:42,774 --> 01:33:44,605
I will love you and only you

1211
01:33:46,844 --> 01:33:48,368
I'll spoil you

1212
01:33:49,647 --> 01:33:51,046
Never argue with you

1213
01:33:54,118 --> 01:33:56,348
I will live up to...

1214
01:33:57,555 --> 01:33:58,954
every promise

1215
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:04,224
Never

1216
01:34:05,696 --> 01:34:07,459
lie to you!

1217
01:34:10,902 --> 01:34:12,631
From now on, you will love only me

1218
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:14,067
You'll spoil me. Never argue with me

1219
01:34:14,305 --> 01:34:15,670
You will always speak the truth

1220
01:34:15,907 --> 01:34:17,636
Never lie to me!

1221
01:34:17,809 --> 01:34:19,868
Never argue with me...

1222
01:34:20,011 --> 01:34:20,909
Honey?

1223
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:22,439
I'll always protect you

1224
01:34:24,382 --> 01:34:25,474
Agree with you

1225
01:34:28,085 --> 01:34:29,211
Believe in you

1226
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,523
I'll stand up for you...

1227
01:34:38,329 --> 01:34:40,524
No matter when or where

1228
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,467
Laugh when

1229
01:34:46,137 --> 01:34:47,365
your laugh

1230
01:34:51,042 --> 01:34:52,509
Wipe away...

1231
01:34:54,946 --> 01:34:56,538
all your tears

1232
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,709
You'll be the only one in my eyes

1233
01:35:03,454 --> 01:35:06,821
The only one in my dreams

1234
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:13,463
Only one...

1235
01:35:17,869 --> 01:35:19,131
in my heart

1236
01:35:24,976 --> 01:35:26,443
It’s just that simple

1237
01:35:28,379 --> 01:35:29,812
Honey...

1238
01:35:31,282 --> 01:35:32,374
I'm sorry

1239
01:35:40,491 --> 01:35:42,857
Whether you remember me or not

1240
01:35:46,964 --> 01:35:48,727
You'll always be...

1241
01:35:51,736 --> 01:35:54,933
my beloved wife

1242
01:35:55,673 --> 01:35:57,971
Honey, don't leave me!

1243
01:36:05,316 --> 01:36:06,681
Honey...

1244
01:36:13,291 --> 01:36:14,622
Honey...

1245
01:36:18,429 --> 01:36:19,589
Honey...

1246
01:36:23,868 --> 01:36:25,096
Honey!

1247
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:27,396
Honey...

1248
01:36:28,539 --> 01:36:30,700
I've a confession

1249
01:36:31,876 --> 01:36:34,470
I've left the soup on the stove
all night

1250
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:36,374
Let's go home and put out the fire?

1251
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:37,569
Great!

1252
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:43,514
Sure...

1253
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:47,320
Does the Love Eraser really work?

1254
01:36:48,059 --> 01:36:52,052
By the orders of the emperor
of course it works...

1255
01:36:56,634 --> 01:36:58,568
Honey! Honey...

1256
01:37:01,339 --> 01:37:02,499
Honey... Honey!

1257
01:37:04,141 --> 01:37:05,301
Three months later

1258
01:37:05,509 --> 01:37:08,137
With my honey's encouragement
I finally published my first book

1259
01:37:08,379 --> 01:37:09,846
Come have a look

1260
01:37:10,114 --> 01:37:11,376
The Lion Roars is a real tear-jerker

1261
01:37:11,749 --> 01:37:14,013
Based on a true story,

1262
01:37:14,685 --> 01:37:18,416
you'll cry, I promise

1263
01:37:21,359 --> 01:37:21,984
The book...

1264
01:37:22,226 --> 01:37:24,456
became very popular...

1265
01:37:24,795 --> 01:37:25,659
Whether you're taking a stroll...

1266
01:37:26,797 --> 01:37:27,786
having lunch...

1267
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:30,593
in the toilet...

1268
01:37:31,936 --> 01:37:33,767
giving birth

1269
01:37:35,172 --> 01:37:36,230
hitching a ride

1270
01:37:36,507 --> 01:37:37,838
you can't put it down

1271
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:40,134
Some say my husband's book

1272
01:37:40,344 --> 01:37:41,777
lacks depth

1273
01:37:41,946 --> 01:37:43,607
and sophistication

1274
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:48,885
But I truly believe that years from now

1275
01:37:49,153 --> 01:37:50,142
they'll still remember...

1276
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,585
our love story!
