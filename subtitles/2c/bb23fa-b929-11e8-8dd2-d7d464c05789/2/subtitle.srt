1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:02,331
- Got it?
- Yes, sir

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:05,892
- You sissies, I can't hear you!
- Yes, sir!

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,862
Seven

4
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:13,297
Stay still!

5
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:23,509
- Ouch, my back
- Stay still, or I'll break your arm

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,159
You get one more beating
Get into position!

7
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:39,258
Listen to what I said and get into position!

8
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:48,705
What's the count?

9
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,702
I said what's the count?

10
00:00:52,181 --> 00:00:56,208
Then I'll tell you
You're nineteen

11
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,619
One

12
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,151
Two

13
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:05,649
Three!

14
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:10,988
Hey, get up!
Get up!

15
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,440
Hey, Hey!
What's wrong with you?

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,704
It's about Joo-hee

17
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,612
I don't think she likes me

18
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:30,078
I gave her flowers and even kissed her

19
00:01:30,185 --> 00:01:32,119
but there's no response

20
00:01:32,387 --> 00:01:34,252
You kissed her?

21
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,523
Yeah

22
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:48,362
When the sun shines on the sea
I think of you

23
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:52,763
When the dim moonlight is on the spring
I think of you

24
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:39,862
Take this and go home
Stay out of the rain

25
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:14,626
Dummy

26
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,334
Do you want to get electrocuted?

27
00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:19,266
You're crazy

28
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:22,164
I don't want to split up like this

29
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,732
Let's talk just for a moment

30
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,141
Nothing can change

31
00:04:26,345 --> 00:04:30,441
There's no use in talking
Let go of me!

32
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,869
Here's your letter

33
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:33,808
I don't want it anymore

34
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:35,338
Why?

35
00:05:35,581 --> 00:05:39,381
There's no response and because of my conscience

36
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:42,119
I'll write it myself from now on

37
00:05:42,488 --> 00:05:44,615
And tell her the truth

38
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,757
It's a golden opportunity

39
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:53,022
I heard she's very sick from the rain

40
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,691
So she's in the hospital

41
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:00,539
She's very sick?
Because of the rain?

42
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,131
Yeah

43
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,268
I'm going to see her

44
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:09,670
If I visit her when she's sick then I can score

45
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:15,486
I'll confess to her that I didn't write the letters

46
00:06:15,988 --> 00:06:18,388
I won't tell her it was you

47
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:23,226
Actually
I'm not the type to like one girl

48
00:06:23,562 --> 00:06:27,430
but I really like her

49
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,599
Oh Joon-ha!

50
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:31,798
Oh Joon-ha!

51
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,504
He's calling you

52
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:34,706
Yes?

53
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:39,871
Twenty four, twenty seven
Thirty, thirty two...

54
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,048
I have to eat all this?

55
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:44,516
Look at this

56
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:48,353
Mawworms, intestinal worms
hookworms, roundworms...

57
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:51,652
You have everything
What the hell did you eat?

58
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,691
Because of you our class has the most parasites

59
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:57,195
But sir it wasn't my manure

60
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,890
Then whose was it?

61
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:04,066
You're the only one who'd have
this many parasites, Eat it now!

62
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:21,785
YOON Tae-soo

63
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:27,515
Eat three

64
00:07:28,627 --> 00:07:30,228
But it's the same manure

65
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:34,995
Yeah, but some spots have more parasites and some don't

66
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,317
How'd you know I was here?

67
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:58,457
Why are you covering your face?

68
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:03,428
Stop it, I haven't washed my face, and it's dirty

69
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,055
But you're still pretty

70
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:08,391
- How'd you know I was here?
- I heard from Tae-soo

71
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:12,466
Why are you laughing?

72
00:08:13,505 --> 00:08:17,771
I heard you ate 32 worm-killing pills

73
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,412
Tae-soo, that bastard has a big mouth

74
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:26,579
Did he say anything else?

75
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:41,058
After being silent for a while that's all he said and left

76
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,527
- Really?
- Yeah

77
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,233
He's so odd

78
00:08:49,574 --> 00:08:52,566
- Are you very sick?
- Yeah

79
00:08:55,347 --> 00:08:56,780
I'm sorry

80
00:08:58,984 --> 00:09:01,316
I must be really stupid

81
00:09:01,653 --> 00:09:07,023
Besides liking you
I'm not good at anything else

82
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,287
No, there's a lot you're good at

83
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:16,595
Like getting drenched and eating worm pills

84
00:09:17,135 --> 00:09:21,731
Don't laugh
This is serious

85
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:27,607
I have to tell Tae-soo about us

86
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,412
Then we can clear our conscience

87
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:37,089
See you later

88
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:38,818
Is this her room?

89
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,527
My poor daughter-in-law!
How'd you get so drenched?

90
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,367
No, lie down

91
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:57,609
A cold can't be taken lightly
You can catch pneumonia

92
00:09:57,609 --> 00:10:00,145
So, are you eating well?

93
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:04,844
You should eat well to recover

94
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:12,289
I'm sorry
This must be the wrong room

95
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,403
Wrong room

96
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,117
Clench your fists

97
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,221
Raise them like this

98
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,672
Now hit me

99
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:02,841
Why should I hit you?

100
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:04,138
Hurry and hit me!

101
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:08,674
I don't like hitting people or getting hit

102
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,382
My dad hit me too many times

103
00:11:10,382 --> 00:11:12,043
I like Joo-hee

104
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:17,744
Actually, she gave me this necklace last summer

105
00:11:20,492 --> 00:11:22,289
Are you okay?

106
00:11:22,761 --> 00:11:27,289
Damn it
I've fallen again

107
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,829
Don't worry

108
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:36,702
And don't let my dad see that necklace

109
00:11:36,908 --> 00:11:38,773
He'll get furious

110
00:11:39,945 --> 00:11:45,144
That necklace was a gift from my dad

111
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,114
To Joo-hee

112
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:57,584
Oh Joon-ha!
It's your letter!

113
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,427
Later on, we went on school break

114
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:06,838
And I thought I couldn't see her again

115
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:08,738
I miss you

116
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,168
I miss you so much I'll die

117
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:17,378
And I'm curious how much our river has changed

118
00:12:17,549 --> 00:12:24,478
Say hi to our haunted house
the shed, and our row boat

119
00:12:24,623 --> 00:12:29,083
Say that I miss them and that I'm doing okay

120
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:34,992
Yesterday, Tae-soo came to me with your Uncle's address

121
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,033
He also confessed a shocking thing to me

122
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:45,399
That you were the one who wrote the letters to me

123
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:48,942
How could you hide that from me?

124
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:52,910
Anyway, it's okay

125
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:58,156
I almost threw away those letters

126
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:01,387
but now I can read them again and think of you

127
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:06,293
Tae-soo also made a suggestion

128
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:11,697
That you put Tae-soo's name on the letters you send me

129
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:17,399
Then my parents will think
that I'm exchanging letters with him

130
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:21,945
Look outside the window

131
00:13:22,147 --> 00:13:24,945
If the branches swing gently in the wind

132
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,713
then the one you love is loving you, too

133
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:34,890
Right now it's snowing outside

134
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,227
When it first snows

135
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:40,596
they say you should stroll with your beloved

136
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:43,460
But I'm just writing a letter

137
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:47,093
Joon-ha, I miss you so much

138
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:51,298
I'm going to get permission to go to Grandpa's house

139
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,577
If I do
I'll send you a telegraph

140
00:13:55,714 --> 00:13:57,614
Open your ears

141
00:13:57,749 --> 00:14:00,013
If you hear your heartbeat

142
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:04,712
then the person you love is loving you, too

143
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,681
Close your eyes

144
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:09,223
If there's a smile on your lips

145
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:14,061
then the person you love is loving you, too

146
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,086
I want to send a telegraph

147
00:14:40,558 --> 00:14:42,527
Then please sign up here

148
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:43,926
Okay

149
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:57,370
But fate must not be on my side

150
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:59,673
One of my letters

151
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:02,580
was returned back to Tae-soo's home

152
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,607
Joo-hee is in love with Joon-ha

153
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:13,685
I'm not in love with Joo-hee

154
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:21,056
Both of them really love each other

155
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,096
So that's why I gave up

156
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,664
Two people in love should be together

157
00:15:32,877 --> 00:15:35,778
It's okay with me

158
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:39,941
No, I love her, too

159
00:15:40,418 --> 00:15:42,682
I won't give up

160
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:50,828
Are you mocking me?
You always want things your way!

161
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:58,367
So your parents mean nothing to you?

162
00:15:58,436 --> 00:16:03,237
Do you know who she is?
She's a congressman's daughter!

163
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,476
Know what that means, you punk?

164
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,347
You deserve to die

165
00:16:14,686 --> 00:16:16,119
You can't even hold on to a girl

166
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:36,199
It was the end of a winter break?

167
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:39,036
I had hoped so much for

168
00:17:03,968 --> 00:17:05,902
Know what this is?

169
00:17:07,205 --> 00:17:08,573
A belt?

170
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:12,065
No, it's a whip

171
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:14,707
This bastard hits me

172
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:20,383
My dad doesn't want it to
but it keeps wanting to hit me

173
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:29,457
That's why I caught it
How should I punish it?

174
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,826
The death penalty

175
00:17:34,199 --> 00:17:37,066
That's exactly what I thought

176
00:17:42,774 --> 00:17:46,471
Kill it slowly and painfully?

177
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:53,648
Or starve it slowly to death?

178
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:57,722
Or give it sleeping pills?

179
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:59,622
Strangle it to death

180
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,855
Good idea

181
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:12,666
Joon-ha

182
00:18:14,973 --> 00:18:18,773
Take good care of Joo-hee

183
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:39,851
Tae-soo!

184
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:45,022
Somebody help!

185
00:19:45,496 --> 00:19:48,329
A person's dying!

186
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:49,734
Tae-soo, you bastard!

187
00:19:49,734 --> 00:19:52,003
Tae-soo, you bastard!

188
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:54,706
Tae-soo, hold on! Hold on!

189
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:59,877
Someone help me!
Somebody's dying!

190
00:19:59,877 --> 00:20:03,711
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!

191
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:11,149
I told you to kill the belt
not yourself

192
00:20:12,523 --> 00:20:16,857
Tae-soo, wake up!
Open your eyes!

193
00:20:17,862 --> 00:20:25,166
Don't die. Don't die
Don't die, you bastard!

194
00:20:25,236 --> 00:20:28,673
Breathe! Breathe!

195
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:33,406
Breathe, you bastard!

196
00:21:24,695 --> 00:21:27,027
Go inside

197
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:43,610
If you're with him
he'll wake up faster

198
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:51,217
Hurry

199
00:22:03,968 --> 00:22:06,436
Wait here for me

200
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:38,195
Hurry and get well

201
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,132
Ji-hae, know what this is?

202
00:25:33,044 --> 00:25:34,705
An umbrella?

203
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:37,181
A very special umbrella

204
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:40,309
They're all the same

205
00:25:40,885 --> 00:25:46,255
It's special because Sang-min gave it to me

206
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:50,895
He must know that I like him

207
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:55,889
Thought he wouldn't
when you stare at him everyday?

208
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,270
Go give this to Sang-min

209
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:03,007
No, you give it to him
I'm not going there

210
00:26:03,007 --> 00:26:04,565
Why not?

211
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:07,541
Did you and Soo-gyung fight?

212
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,012
Remember when it suddenly rained that day?

213
00:26:14,351 --> 00:26:18,219
Sang-min was drinking coffee here

214
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:23,050
He was looking out of the window

215
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:27,860
then suddenly turned to me and said

216
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:34,000
"Did you bring an umbrella?"

217
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:39,241
And then I said
"I was worried I didn't"

218
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:45,346
He placed his umbrella here

219
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,579
and said
"You can have it"

220
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:52,851
He said he was okay to get wet

221
00:26:53,057 --> 00:26:56,925
And then he ran off in the rain

222
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:08,862
Did you bring an umbrella?

223
00:27:13,577 --> 00:27:16,512
You can have it.

224
00:27:21,852 --> 00:27:26,290
It's raining a lot outside

225
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:30,989
Sang-min might be getting soaked without an umbrella

226
00:27:47,545 --> 00:27:52,380
This is a really special umbrella

227
00:27:53,651 --> 00:27:57,553
I'll give it back to him

228
00:28:04,395 --> 00:28:07,455
Did you bring an umbrella?

229
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:09,266
Of course, I did

230
00:28:09,266 --> 00:28:10,699
Really?

231
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:13,997
But still, take mine

232
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,900
Is she crazy?

233
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:43,584
You have an umbrella
but why are you so soaked?

234
00:29:44,862 --> 00:29:48,389
It's not mine

235
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:51,066
I came to return it to you

236
00:29:51,735 --> 00:29:54,431
You left it at the store

237
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:03,637
I'm not the only one
who gets wet even with an umbrella, am I?

238
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,451
Don't go

239
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:25,164
You already know...

240
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:27,796
my feelings

241
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:33,706
Now, you know it all

242
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:41,177
Yeah

243
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:46,384
when I saw you run without an umbrella

244
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,827
I left my umbrella behind

245
00:30:54,832 --> 00:30:57,426
Even on the day of the play

246
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:04,865
I wanted to give you a present
so I bought Soo-gyung's, too

247
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,043
And if fate was on my side

248
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:16,085
I thought you'd pick the gift with the card in it

249
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:20,852
I thought we'd grow distant

250
00:31:21,959 --> 00:31:24,587
if I confessed my feelings

251
00:31:24,695 --> 00:31:29,394
I wanted to say that I liked you,
but I couldn't

252
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:33,936
I'll come see the play

253
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:47,811
Look
I cut my wrists

254
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,116
I saw it all
Both of you whispering love

255
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,791
Do you really love her?

256
00:31:57,928 --> 00:31:58,929
Is it really so?

257
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:01,124
I'm working out my feelings

258
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:04,963
My eyes were looking straight

259
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,126
but my heart was confused

260
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:10,365
Can I trust those words?

261
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:14,403
Can I think of it as a promise?

262
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,271
Yes

263
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:21,782
There's only one that I love

264
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:25,589
That one is me, right?

265
00:32:25,589 --> 00:32:27,181
Yes, I love you

266
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:29,259
I swear that I love you

267
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:31,829
I love you, too

268
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:33,831
Sang-min
I love you so much

269
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,264
Sang-min!

270
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,880
What the hell are you doing?

271
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:01,352
I didn't even finish my lines
and then you call out my name?

272
00:33:01,658 --> 00:33:03,160
You can't just change your lines like that

273
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,761
You ruined everything!

274
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:08,365
Sang-min, I wasn't acting
it was my true feelings

275
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:10,300
I love you
Love is more important than a play

276
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,460
I love you

277
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,365
After the play Sang-min and I went on a date

278
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,661
We decided to go to the river

279
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:51,139
where my mother's memories lay

280
00:33:59,316 --> 00:34:00,943
Joo-hee?

281
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:08,458
No, I'm her daughter
My name is Ji-hae

282
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,323
Is that so?

283
00:34:10,727 --> 00:34:12,718
I must've made a mistake

284
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:16,156
But you look so much like your mom

285
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:21,939
I delivered a lot of your mom's letters

286
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,236
Thank you, sir

287
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:49,527
I know well what happened to my parents afterwards

288
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,704
Students and citizens!

289
00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:00,941
This is illegal demonstrations!

290
00:35:02,512 --> 00:35:04,881
Eliminate corruption and establish a new state!
A new state!

291
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:06,850
Down with dictatorship and the military regime!

292
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:09,444
Down with the regime!
Down with dictatorship!

293
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:51,821
If you wipe on toothpaste
your eyes will hurt less

294
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:57,626
- Joo-hee?
- Tae-soo?

295
00:35:58,568 --> 00:36:00,627
Put on toothpaste

296
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:36,233
It's been a long time

297
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,072
It has

298
00:36:43,046 --> 00:36:49,474
Have you heard from Joon-ha?

299
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,365
Joon-ha!

300
00:38:13,303 --> 00:38:15,168
Joon-ha!

301
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:18,006
Joon-ha!

302
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,418
Joon-ha!

303
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:30,614
Joon-ha!

304
00:38:36,726 --> 00:38:38,455
Joon-ha!

305
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:47,893
Joon-ha
come back alive!

306
00:38:49,773 --> 00:38:56,178
Joon-ah!
You have to come back alive!

307
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,407
Joon-ha!

308
00:38:59,649 --> 00:39:03,415
Joon-ha
answer me!

309
00:39:03,653 --> 00:39:05,382
Joon-ha!

310
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:16,861
Joon-ha...
come back alive!

311
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:24,101
Joon-ha
come back alive!

312
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:28,203
Joon-ha!

313
00:39:37,787 --> 00:39:39,311
Joon-ha!

314
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:41,989
Joon-ha!

315
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,025
Joon-ha!

316
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:47,094
Joon-ha!

317
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,260
Joon-ha!

318
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:54,597
Joon-ha!

319
00:39:56,072 --> 00:39:57,903
Joo-hee!

320
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:06,944
- Joon-ha!
- Joo-hee!

321
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:10,921
- Joo-hee!
- Joon-ha!

322
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:11,979
Tae-soo!

323
00:40:12,222 --> 00:40:13,519
Joon-ha!

324
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,388
Joon-ha!

325
00:40:21,364 --> 00:40:22,831
Joon-ha!

326
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,206
You have to come back alive!

327
00:40:30,206 --> 00:40:31,798
Joon-ha!

328
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:35,939
Joon-ha
come back alive!

329
00:40:36,913 --> 00:40:39,609
You have to come back alive!

330
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:42,678
Got it?

331
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:42,130
Medic! Medic!

332
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:46,970
Hold on! Hold on!
Breathe! Breathe!

333
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:49,076
Stop it!

334
00:42:49,145 --> 00:42:51,943
He's dead! Retreat!
Get moving, you bastard!

335
00:43:56,279 --> 00:43:57,678
Joon-ha, you bastard!

336
00:43:58,014 --> 00:44:00,983
Where are you going?

337
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:04,443
Come back!
Corporal OH!

338
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:18,631
You haven't changed at all

339
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:22,099
Just like in the past

340
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:25,367
you're still pretty

341
00:48:28,814 --> 00:48:33,012
I've aged a lot

342
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:49,826
- You had it hard, huh?
- Not really

343
00:48:58,177 --> 00:49:01,169
How's Tae-soo doing?

344
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,881
I guess he's doing alright

345
00:49:16,595 --> 00:49:21,328
Why didn't you get married?

346
00:49:26,472 --> 00:49:30,533
Well, I did

347
00:49:39,051 --> 00:49:42,214
I heard

348
00:49:47,759 --> 00:49:50,557
I had so much to tell you

349
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:56,258
But now that we've met
I can't remember

350
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,208
It's a piano doll

351
00:50:14,353 --> 00:50:17,015
We have one at my home, too

352
00:50:19,124 --> 00:50:25,063
When I look at it
it reminds me of you playing the piano

353
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:35,500
It looks so much like you back then

354
00:50:36,475 --> 00:50:38,636
Doesn't it?

355
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:56,987
We were so innocent back then

356
00:50:57,062 --> 00:51:00,054
But the past has gone now

357
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:06,572
I think our feelings took the best of us

358
00:51:06,572 --> 00:51:12,033
We cried and laughed at the smallest things

359
00:51:39,605 --> 00:51:45,009
How do I look right now?

360
00:51:47,512 --> 00:51:49,776
You look healthy

361
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:58,183
But I'd like to see you look happier

362
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:09,700
I'm crying right now
Can't you see my tears?

363
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:22,644
Why did you hide that you couldn't see?

364
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,157
It's late

365
00:52:35,327 --> 00:52:37,955
Sorry, I have an appointment

366
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:40,223
I have to go

367
00:53:33,352 --> 00:53:35,047
I'm sorry

368
00:53:35,187 --> 00:53:40,318
It was almost perfect
I could've succeeded

369
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:46,327
I even came here last night to practice

370
00:53:48,567 --> 00:53:51,559
You almost fooled me

371
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:59,209
You did a good job
I nearly believed you

372
00:54:00,212 --> 00:54:02,407
Also...

373
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:12,449
I risked my life to return this necklace to you

374
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:22,791
Please don't

375
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:28,932
This necklace is yours

376
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,838
Afterwards, mom and dad got married
And I was born three years later

377
00:55:37,943 --> 00:55:41,504
Then a few years later...

378
00:56:19,184 --> 00:56:21,152
Mrs. Sung Joo-hee?

379
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:32,929
Joon-ha's last wish

380
00:56:35,367 --> 00:56:42,466
was for you to spread his dust in this river

381
00:56:46,845 --> 00:56:48,745
Actually

382
00:56:49,681 --> 00:56:51,649
Joon-ha

383
00:56:53,485 --> 00:56:58,354
got married right after you did

384
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,598
Poor guy had a son, too

385
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:36,156
And Joon-ha

386
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:40,023
wanted you to have this

387
00:58:39,758 --> 00:58:42,124
Mommy, it's a rainbow

388
00:58:51,703 --> 00:58:55,469
I still remember clearly the rainbow I saw that day

389
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,068
Until I finished telling this story

390
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:03,253
Open your hands
