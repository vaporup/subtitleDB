1
00:03:16,256 --> 00:03:18,451
Ladies and gentlemen, from the picture,

2
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,319
you can tell easily that

3
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,517
she is my dream lover

4
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,756
To impress her, I'd take this chance

5
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:26,694
I'll show her some of my martial arts

6
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:50,048
She is not touched!

7
00:04:07,473 --> 00:04:08,030
Come back!

8
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,908
No girls...

9
00:04:11,077 --> 00:04:13,045
will refuse such things

10
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:24,119
I've told you for 28 years!

11
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,882
You can't fall for that girl

12
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:26,855
Who are you?

13
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:29,154
Why do you stop me from dreaming?

14
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,157
I don't want to see you!

15
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,031
OK! I'll send you back to your world!

16
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,337
Shut up!

17
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,873
The same dream?
You've dreamt it for 28 years!

18
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,238
Yes. But I don't know why...

19
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,113
I think the girl is fond of you,

20
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,882
otherwise she won't come
to your dream every night

21
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:54,177
I think so. But she'll leave soon

22
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,479
Look at you! My god-father!

23
00:04:57,657 --> 00:05:00,182
If you don't dress well,

24
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:02,083
I do want to leave you! You know?

25
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:05,158
To keep you and my dream lover
to stay with me

26
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,166
I'll change!

27
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,887
What'll we practise today?

28
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,519
Make it abc!

29
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:52,675
ab...

30
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:53,607
c!

31
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,082
Smart boy!

32
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:05,349
The alarm!

33
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,184
What's the matter?

34
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:09,285
Go and search for it

35
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:10,224
OK!

36
00:06:23,476 --> 00:06:25,273
You've mistaken it!

37
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,646
Sorry! Sorry!

38
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:33,708
Ready?

39
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:34,614
Yes!

40
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:38,781
Change position!

41
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:50,931
Jump!

42
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:57,633
Your turn!

43
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:58,467
Come on!

44
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:02,344
Your turn!

45
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:08,349
Your turn!

46
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:10,820
I'm coming!

47
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,290
I'll go and have a look

48
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:20,862
This is so dark!

49
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,061
Can you see anything?

50
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:26,800
Yes I do!

51
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,366
What have you seen?

52
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:37,640
Oh! There's something!

53
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:38,511
Forget it!

54
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,480
Just take it easy!

55
00:07:39,785 --> 00:07:40,251
What?

56
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:41,551
Turn on the light

57
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:46,884
What?

58
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,286
What is it?

59
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:49,485
Look!

60
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:57,668
I think,
doctor must have done something wrong

61
00:07:57,837 --> 00:07:59,236
If not, he would not have scared us

62
00:08:00,006 --> 00:08:00,734
Let's wait for his appearance

63
00:08:05,344 --> 00:08:06,174
Come out!

64
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:09,545
I know you are here!

65
00:08:09,815 --> 00:08:11,180
Just tell us what's in your mind!

66
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:13,879
What you've done wrong

67
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,248
I'm your god-son, I'll give you face

68
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,117
Well, don't beat me, ok?

69
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,617
Ok!

70
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:24,528
I'm sorry! I did something wrong!

71
00:08:24,697 --> 00:08:26,164
What is it?

72
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:27,227
Just go ahead

73
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,367
I...

74
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:30,493
Come on!

75
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,465
I lost 5 cents yesterday in the market

76
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:33,570
You!?

77
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,411
Go to hell!

78
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:43,877
How can you lose 5 cents!

79
00:08:45,151 --> 00:08:46,049
Damn it!

80
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,948
Do you know it's your fault?

81
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,850
Yes, I do...

82
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:52,820
If you can't find it back

83
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,460
I'll teach you good lessons
until you get it back

84
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,365
Shit! Let's go!

85
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:10,466
I've got it back!

86
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:13,643
My turn now!

87
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,144
Come and eat breakfast!

88
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,750
Yours...

89
00:09:23,823 --> 00:09:27,315
Why don't you eat?

90
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:30,319
You've taken revenge, haven't you?

91
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:31,827
Are you kidding?

92
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:33,120
Although we misunderstood you,

93
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,664
you know I'm growing!

94
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,767
It's not enough for me to eat
such a small egg

95
00:09:37,737 --> 00:09:39,398
This is not for your breakfast
but for our experiment!

96
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:40,095
What?

97
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:40,601
Kidding?

98
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:41,398
For experiment?

99
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,700
I tell you, if it is successful

100
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:44,672
It'll be enough for few meals of yours

101
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:46,674
I won't believe it

102
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,177
So am I!

103
00:09:48,648 --> 00:09:49,478
Don't you?

104
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:52,509
I'll show you now!

105
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:57,517
This is my newest invention

106
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,515
It's microscope!

107
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,393
Yes, it is

108
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:03,994
But it's not a common one

109
00:10:04,363 --> 00:10:06,695
I've taken long time to design it,
it is...

110
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:07,522
ridiculous!

111
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,726
It's a super microscope made by me!

112
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:14,271
Touch this button,

113
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,963
put it above an object

114
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:19,077
all will be changed, see!

115
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,039
See!

116
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:22,908
It's microscope!

117
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:23,878
Yes

118
00:10:24,283 --> 00:10:24,977
Look!

119
00:10:30,556 --> 00:10:32,114
I'm successful!

120
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,589
It's enough for any kind of growth!

121
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:41,459
He really makes it!

122
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,564
But what a pity that
we can't take other food for few days

123
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:54,669
I don't feel I'm full!

124
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:57,238
What? Let me help you
with your new invention

125
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:01,214
Here is an attractive advertisement

126
00:11:02,254 --> 00:11:03,687
part time job!

127
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,449
to earn over 10 millions!

128
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,683
We're going to be rich

129
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,120
This is the scroll...

130
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:11,991
which recorded all legends of the world

131
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:13,859
this is the sutra of lama

132
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,066
so is it

133
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:20,539
this is special

134
00:11:20,706 --> 00:11:21,331
What is it?

135
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:22,235
this is the sutra of lama too

136
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:22,999
shit!

137
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:26,308
how about this?

138
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:27,508
It's great!

139
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,847
this is the treasure
we are going to find out

140
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,415
this is the virgin's mountain

141
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,986
from the scroll, it's stated that...

142
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:37,849
the virgin's Ice is hidden

143
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,455
If we can get the virgin's Ice

144
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,785
We can change it for big money...

145
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,587
from the evil's palace

146
00:11:42,795 --> 00:11:43,352
If we breathe in the "essence air",

147
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:44,996
we can live forever

148
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,362
Wait!

149
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:47,156
What's the matter?

150
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,957
our stuff maybe stolen if we are leaving

151
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,135
if we can't get the ice

152
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,395
then,

153
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:54,402
we'll suffer double loss!

154
00:11:54,707 --> 00:11:55,401
right?

155
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:56,233
that is

156
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:57,033
so you agree?

157
00:11:57,243 --> 00:11:57,675
don't worry!

158
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:58,707
my new invention...

159
00:11:58,878 --> 00:12:00,539
two to one vision obstruction liquid

160
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:03,238
With its help, it'll be fine!

161
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:04,745
What is it?

162
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:06,475
two to one...

163
00:12:07,253 --> 00:12:08,982
It makes things invisible, got it?

164
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:10,417
got you!

165
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:12,886
do your work!

166
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:14,723
It's fixed!

167
00:12:15,161 --> 00:12:15,957
What's wrong?

168
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,360
let's go!

169
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,160
the liquid is really great!

170
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:24,267
how about the money? Destroyed?

171
00:12:24,503 --> 00:12:25,834
I've solution to make it visible!

172
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,438
let's go!

173
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:57,163
hey tim!

174
00:12:57,536 --> 00:12:58,230
this way!

175
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,129
this way!

176
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:00,101
I'm coming!

177
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:03,366
hurry up!

178
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,304
We won't wait for you!

179
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,250
Wait for me!

180
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:48,117
doctor, isn't it here?

181
00:13:48,587 --> 00:13:52,523
It's stated that, below the virgin's
mountain, there is a life terminal

182
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:54,318
Yes! It's right!

183
00:13:54,827 --> 00:13:56,192
let me have a look

184
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,762
It's stated that there is a calabash and

185
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,059
a word "bar" next to it

186
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:03,232
It's the location stated!

187
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,797
let's go!

188
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:05,727
ok!

189
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:08,169
no, there is a plane flying towards us!

190
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,377
We can't take this way!

191
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,773
no! Someone is coming

192
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,114
how about this side?

193
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:21,080
no!

194
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:23,050
there are motor cycles!

195
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,421
great! A car is drinking water

196
00:14:27,026 --> 00:14:29,358
What so funny?
there is a horse drinking oil

197
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:35,656
It's real! We'd find another exit

198
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,698
Why?

199
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:37,358
there is car!

200
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:39,404
may I know your name?

201
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,333
ruby!

202
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,030
What song would you like?

203
00:14:42,207 --> 00:14:43,139
I want to hear "dream lover"

204
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:44,674
for you dream lover?

205
00:14:44,877 --> 00:14:46,105
but he is not existing!

206
00:14:46,312 --> 00:14:46,835
am I silly?

207
00:14:47,112 --> 00:14:49,205
silly or not, it's of no difference now!

208
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:51,109
Why is he not existing?

209
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:52,042
because he is my dream lover!

210
00:14:52,217 --> 00:14:53,582
so he is not existing in my world

211
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,450
about your dream lover,

212
00:14:55,621 --> 00:14:57,555
is he having...

213
00:14:57,923 --> 00:14:58,480
any visible figure?

214
00:14:58,724 --> 00:14:59,656
sure!

215
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:00,618
he is as strong as...

216
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,818
arnold schwarzenegger

217
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:05,691
he's having a baby face as michael fox

218
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:09,195
he is as tall as richard gere

219
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,901
he is as charm as tom cruise

220
00:15:12,271 --> 00:15:14,762
I love his roman nose most

221
00:15:15,574 --> 00:15:17,701
What a perfect match! I think
it's hard to find one in this world

222
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,604
that's right!

223
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:21,278
so you've to make more dreams

224
00:15:23,248 --> 00:15:26,342
I know I can only see him in my dream

225
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,618
miss ruby, what are you doing?

226
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:32,256
doctor, how can we get up? It's too high

227
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:35,287
I think there won't be any car

228
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,126
this is something white in front,
what is it?

229
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:42,763
What's the matter?

230
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:44,969
nothing! I've just scared it away!

231
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,602
let's go up!

232
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:54,970
Is it the correct exit?

233
00:15:55,214 --> 00:15:56,306
It's written in the scroll!

234
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,710
Wait for me!

235
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,221
damn it!

236
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,459
they just sneak away
after peeping my bath!

237
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,229
try my super scissors legs! Go to hell!

238
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:27,507
What is it?

239
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:30,507
It disappears soon!

240
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,310
I've seen something flying towards me!

241
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:33,414
me too!

242
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,016
maybe it's ghost! Let's go!

243
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:36,547
I've to worship god when we go back

244
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:40,416
let's go!

245
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:41,616
I'm coming!

246
00:16:42,061 --> 00:16:44,962
how are you? Miss ruby?

247
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:49,898
I'm fine,
I think I've just seen my dream lover

248
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,396
but he is a little bit short

249
00:16:53,038 --> 00:16:55,029
don't be that selective!
It's a rare chance

250
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,542
You're right!
I've to make use of this chance

251
00:16:59,545 --> 00:17:01,137
don't get angry

252
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,438
It'll harm your health

253
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:04,439
don't be that angry,

254
00:17:04,616 --> 00:17:05,776
it'll harm your health

255
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,145
don't be that angry!

256
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:11,481
don't be that angry!

257
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:14,455
someone is stealing!

258
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,293
Where?

259
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:25,198
Wait for me! Don't go that fast!

260
00:17:26,538 --> 00:17:27,436
stop it!

261
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,338
are you new?

262
00:17:33,078 --> 00:17:34,670
do you know your job?

263
00:17:35,747 --> 00:17:36,805
that means you don't know

264
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:39,114
Look! All the men want...

265
00:17:39,384 --> 00:17:41,716
to get the virgin's Ice

266
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:44,781
haven't you told her?

267
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:45,921
I'll let you tell her

268
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,849
no one can...

269
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:52,062
return safely

270
00:17:52,297 --> 00:17:53,321
Why?

271
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:57,129
It's simple! It's impossible for them
to get to the virgin's mountain

272
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,365
and any of them can get the ice
before sunset

273
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,103
therefore,

274
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:05,310
why not take their money?

275
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:07,376
or, their money will just stay
in the mountain with their skeleton!

276
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:08,307
that means cheating?

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,408
cheating?

278
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:12,440
no! It's technique

279
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,276
should I seduce them?

280
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:17,721
here is the life terminal

281
00:18:18,157 --> 00:18:21,092
that means
the men will go to heaven tomorrow

282
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,158
just take it as beneficence

283
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:26,989
and, leave the man...

284
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,463
with roman nose to me

285
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:32,362
such cool feeling,

286
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:34,831
I can get from him only

287
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,772
I love your roman nose

288
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,172
I hate others mentioning my roman nose

289
00:18:44,883 --> 00:18:46,009
You deserve it!

290
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,015
serve you right!

291
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:52,252
no one is capable of being our opponent

292
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:53,786
I think even they can get to the top,

293
00:18:54,493 --> 00:18:55,892
they still can't have the ice

294
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,322
Why don't we rob their money?

295
00:18:59,364 --> 00:19:00,854
no! We can't use this way

296
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,933
no! Then we can steal

297
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:04,793
no way!

298
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,271
that's a very filthy behavior

299
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,736
Why not! Anyway

300
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:13,502
they won't be able to come back alive
after tomorrow

301
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,213
I want to help them...

302
00:19:15,581 --> 00:19:16,946
to keep their money

303
00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:19,276
good deed! Good deed!

304
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,950
good deed! Good deed!

305
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:06,657
stephen chow sing-chi?

306
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,162
no, I am...

307
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,661
tim chow ha-chi!

308
00:20:13,705 --> 00:20:14,501
What are you laughing?

309
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,736
chow did the same

310
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,340
I've mistaken it!

311
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,376
I don't want to play this, but...

312
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:28,883
guessing game!

313
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:33,916
ok, let's bet a million

314
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:35,457
deal!

315
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:39,329
We don't have so much money to bet

316
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:40,326
sure win!

317
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:41,256
sure win?

318
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,494
deal!

319
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:51,769
get ready!

320
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:57,847
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

321
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:04,155
7, 8, 9

322
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:13,063
how poor are you? You're so slow!

323
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:15,857
do you have money to pay?

324
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,098
What did you cover?

325
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:17,597
It's a nine

326
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:18,827
are you sure it's a nine

327
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:19,366
Yes!

328
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:20,232
sure?

329
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:20,868
Yes!

330
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:21,664
open it!

331
00:21:22,641 --> 00:21:23,835
It's not nine, but there is a line!

332
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,177
bingo!

333
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:28,476
she lost!

334
00:21:28,947 --> 00:21:30,141
bingo! I've make it!

335
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,720
I always win!

336
00:21:40,959 --> 00:21:42,551
You mean giving me money?

337
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:45,525
so, I can hire somebody to carry me

338
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:47,788
instead of walking up
to the virgin's mountain

339
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:49,793
let's see who plays first

340
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:50,764
sure

341
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:51,664
I want head

342
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:52,763
ok

343
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,712
It's head, lady first

344
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,912
sorry, me first

345
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,517
after you

346
00:22:43,054 --> 00:22:44,578
make the bet $500,000 for it

347
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:48,588
I don't think
no one wants to play with me anymore

348
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:52,189
You're wrong! I want to play with you

349
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:00,635
hi

350
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,837
to make me scream,
to make my heart beats

351
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:10,480
It's your name!

352
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,307
to make me scream...

353
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:21,055
the angel of the corrupt age?

354
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:25,860
may I know your name?

355
00:23:26,097 --> 00:23:27,086
I was called davis in the past

356
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:28,357
now, I'm called hungary

357
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:31,401
head or tail?

358
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,098
head

359
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:34,433
I want tail

360
00:23:36,074 --> 00:23:37,132
What a strange smell?

361
00:23:37,342 --> 00:23:37,831
It's fixed!

362
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,745
sorry, it's mine

363
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:44,981
never mind

364
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:51,083
tail, me first

365
00:24:06,872 --> 00:24:07,770
sir, are you martial-artist?

366
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,675
don't be nosy!

367
00:24:28,827 --> 00:24:30,624
Where is the ball?

368
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:32,926
What?

369
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:37,761
sorry!

370
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:41,597
change it!

371
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:46,240
how can it be?

372
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,914
that's too powerful!

373
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:54,442
I see! I see!

374
00:24:54,753 --> 00:24:55,685
Watch out!

375
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:11,065
don't get angry, it'll harm your health

376
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:13,236
don't get angry, it'll harm your health

377
00:25:38,296 --> 00:25:40,628
now, there are 25 marks left
on the table

378
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,535
If I get that ball, I'll win

379
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,664
shit! What to do then?

380
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,530
I've got any idea

381
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:54,176
super microscope!

382
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:58,440
It's fixed!

383
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,448
how lucky are you!

384
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:10,693
thanks!

385
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:12,896
What is it?

386
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:13,587
nothing!

387
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:31,013
super microscope

388
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,210
he's smart!

389
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,165
this is quite difficult

390
00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:56,038
bravo...

391
00:27:02,347 --> 00:27:04,406
I think you'll lose that $500,000

392
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:12,645
thank you!

393
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,728
What?

394
00:27:23,401 --> 00:27:25,995
You'll lose that $500,000

395
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,399
but if you don't have money,

396
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:31,107
I'll take you in return!

397
00:27:31,376 --> 00:27:32,274
stop dreaming!

398
00:27:37,716 --> 00:27:38,876
Watch out! Don't miss it

399
00:27:43,922 --> 00:27:45,219
I won't let you hit it

400
00:27:45,523 --> 00:27:46,581
I prefer eating it

401
00:27:51,896 --> 00:27:53,386
are you kidding?

402
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,189
give the ball back to me

403
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,258
give it now!

404
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,271
how bad you are!

405
00:28:10,682 --> 00:28:12,206
super microscope!

406
00:28:16,588 --> 00:28:18,419
are we going too far?

407
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:19,419
my turn!

408
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:29,425
the ball is broken!

409
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:32,433
change it!

410
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,320
get lost!

411
00:28:56,427 --> 00:28:57,485
can you stand it?

412
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:02,594
I think I should use my own cue

413
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:10,168
I've fixed up all the pockets!

414
00:29:14,946 --> 00:29:15,935
thank you!

415
00:29:16,915 --> 00:29:17,711
hold it!

416
00:29:28,193 --> 00:29:29,091
You mean it?

417
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,224
cut the crap!

418
00:29:30,829 --> 00:29:31,727
come on!

419
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:33,997
tim, it's your turn!

420
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:49,680
the chinese kid is really great!

421
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:51,538
We win at last!

422
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:54,516
my god!

423
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:55,950
arrest them!

424
00:29:56,521 --> 00:29:57,249
go!

425
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:04,059
It's dead end!

426
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:05,089
You can't go!

427
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,124
Why?

428
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,933
because you are my dream lover

429
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:10,927
many people love to use such excuse!

430
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:12,169
You are great!

431
00:30:12,737 --> 00:30:13,533
Your dream lover is not me

432
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:14,729
It's should be michael fox

433
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:16,733
You are my dream lover!

434
00:30:17,275 --> 00:30:18,105
should I listen to you?

435
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,206
arrest him!

436
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:21,504
go!

437
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:33,223
admit it, or we can't escape!

438
00:30:33,391 --> 00:30:34,119
admit it!

439
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:35,087
ok!

440
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,383
since we'd use this trick,

441
00:30:40,231 --> 00:30:41,596
I've to reveal my heart
by writing a letter with my blood

442
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:46,301
hold it!

443
00:31:05,456 --> 00:31:05,922
What have you done?

444
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:06,886
I help you to increase your speed

445
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:07,883
really?

446
00:31:13,932 --> 00:31:14,830
You can go now!

447
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,998
Isn't it that kind of you?

448
00:31:17,201 --> 00:31:18,532
but be careful!

449
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,169
come back!

450
00:31:21,906 --> 00:31:22,565
What's it?

451
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:24,202
forget it, let's go for the Ice

452
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,473
let's go for the dream

453
00:31:27,211 --> 00:31:28,405
go!

454
00:31:31,249 --> 00:31:32,011
see you!

455
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,216
I'll wait for you

456
00:32:18,096 --> 00:32:19,256
I can't stand any more!

457
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:22,199
You are useless!

458
00:32:22,633 --> 00:32:23,497
let us help you

459
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,402
thank you!

460
00:32:28,373 --> 00:32:29,135
You are welcome!

461
00:32:29,307 --> 00:32:30,103
cause you are old!

462
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,508
We are young, so we'd help

463
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:46,086
What flavour is your food?

464
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:48,851
banana, what's yours?

465
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,251
mine has a flavour of durian

466
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:51,525
really? Let me try

467
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,719
great!

468
00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:55,856
Isn't it right?

469
00:32:56,234 --> 00:32:56,893
It's true!

470
00:32:58,536 --> 00:32:59,696
mixed fruit punch?!

471
00:33:02,373 --> 00:33:02,964
It's tasteless!

472
00:33:03,541 --> 00:33:05,270
how can you believe such nonsense!

473
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,777
What was it in the past?

474
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,344
It was a river

475
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:13,743
now it's frozen

476
00:33:14,152 --> 00:33:15,016
a helicopter!

477
00:33:15,553 --> 00:33:16,542
someone wants to take our picture?

478
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,014
no!

479
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:20,854
they know
we'll be successful in getting the Ice

480
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,649
so they are shooting the process
for a tv special

481
00:33:23,327 --> 00:33:24,089
are you kidding?

482
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:24,853
I am serious!

483
00:33:25,096 --> 00:33:25,790
my god!

484
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,861
many people will know me! I'll be busy!

485
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,330
according to the scroll

486
00:33:33,504 --> 00:33:34,562
after this river,

487
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:36,740
we'll reach a narrow valley

488
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,669
Isn't it?

489
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:41,069
be careful

490
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:44,644
Watch out! Beware of slippery

491
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:46,448
forget it

492
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:49,883
be careful!

493
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:54,215
after the valley, then comes a cliff

494
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,263
be careful of slippery!

495
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:08,066
Why didn't you warn me earlier?

496
00:34:13,845 --> 00:34:15,278
What you've said, we all went through

497
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:16,605
What's next?

498
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:18,475
there is a slope ahead

499
00:34:18,883 --> 00:34:22,046
after it, there is a slight slope too

500
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:23,877
just slide down

501
00:34:24,755 --> 00:34:25,653
that is!

502
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:26,949
let's go!

503
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:29,521
the slope is just in front

504
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:30,690
go down!

505
00:34:31,262 --> 00:34:31,956
come on!

506
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:34,522
It's rather steep!

507
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,458
Isn't it a slight slope?

508
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:39,802
how long will it take?

509
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:42,497
according to the scroll,

510
00:34:42,807 --> 00:34:44,638
it'll take over an hour

511
00:34:45,076 --> 00:34:45,940
kidding?

512
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,371
You've said we'd soon get there!

513
00:34:51,883 --> 00:34:52,508
I don't know!

514
00:34:55,586 --> 00:34:57,144
how far will it take?

515
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,211
You liar!

516
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:00,782
It's the scroll...

517
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,490
which misleads me!

518
00:35:08,132 --> 00:35:09,064
It's cold!

519
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:13,795
Watch out for your head!

520
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:14,961
Where are you going?

521
00:35:15,273 --> 00:35:16,171
I'll have a look!

522
00:35:16,908 --> 00:35:17,772
be careful!

523
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:21,678
kids always love speed!

524
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:22,808
let's go to help!

525
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,069
ok! Come on!

526
00:35:27,852 --> 00:35:28,750
follow me!

527
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:32,687
Where has he gone?

528
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,491
Who is he? He looks familiar to us

529
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,756
I think it's tim, naked tim!

530
00:35:40,898 --> 00:35:42,229
put on the clothes!

531
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,100
damn it!

532
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,170
how dare you undress me?

533
00:35:49,707 --> 00:35:50,537
I just want to help!

534
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:51,298
Yes

535
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:55,372
What time is it?

536
00:35:57,882 --> 00:35:59,611
11 o'clock. It's dark!

537
00:36:00,685 --> 00:36:01,743
It seems to be dangerous!

538
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:03,583
let's leave here now!

539
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:04,344
What?

540
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,984
the scroll stated that

541
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:07,249
we'd get here by 11 o'clock!

542
00:36:07,592 --> 00:36:08,320
really?

543
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:09,550
It's true! Let's go!

544
00:36:17,568 --> 00:36:18,364
Watch out!

545
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:21,266
doctor

546
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:22,930
shall we come tomorrow?

547
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:23,935
do you want to get rich?

548
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:24,970
You can come yourself tomorrow

549
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:31,437
god-father!

550
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:35,652
ching Yan...

551
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:42,951
are you fine?

552
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:44,059
how are you?

553
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:45,985
forget about me! You'd better leave now

554
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:47,527
don't panic

555
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,990
I'll ask for help

556
00:36:50,268 --> 00:36:51,667
no, I want to stay here to accompany him

557
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:52,799
Well, you can stay here

558
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,038
no! I want to go with you to seek help

559
00:36:55,306 --> 00:36:56,170
so, let's go, quick!

560
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:30,998
I feel like staying in my dream!

561
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:47,242
shit!

562
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:51,118
I can't see!

563
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:55,385
It is getting dark

564
00:38:57,795 --> 00:38:59,854
can I stand it?

565
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:01,293
Ching Yan!

566
00:39:03,334 --> 00:39:07,168
Ching Yan! You can't sleep! Get up!

567
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:10,967
my god! He falls asleep!

568
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:13,609
he'll be dead if he can't wake up!

569
00:39:14,845 --> 00:39:17,177
I've to enter his dream!

570
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:21,951
ching Yan, get up now!

571
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,484

573
00:39:50,147 --> 00:39:54,709
I'm in danger! Get up!

574
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:06,319
I'm in danger! Get up!

575
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:14,036
he wakes up!

576
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:18,266
madam...

577
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:19,570
don't come over

578
00:40:50,741 --> 00:40:53,505
Your majesty, I've checked that

579
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,678
3 men have taken the virgin's Ice

580
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,878
that's good!

581
00:40:59,617 --> 00:41:02,518
What'll we do now?

582
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:06,389
You stupid ass!

583
00:41:06,624 --> 00:41:07,852
When they come down, rob their Ice

584
00:41:08,192 --> 00:41:08,954
Yes!

585
00:41:09,393 --> 00:41:10,325
If you can't rob it

586
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:12,027
all of you should die!

587
00:41:12,363 --> 00:41:13,091
Yes sir

588
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,854
We'll get it

589
00:41:15,165 --> 00:41:17,690
to give you the "essence air"

590
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,027
long life to Your majesty!

591
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:55,734

592
00:41:55,906 --> 00:41:58,739

593
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,574
Where are you?

594
00:42:00,744 --> 00:42:02,234
he left the shoes!

595
00:42:04,348 --> 00:42:05,440
You dumb bell!

596
00:42:05,683 --> 00:42:07,844
he is covered by the snow!
go and save him!

597
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,220
don't go that fast! Wait for me!

598
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:16,052
I've to catch you up

599
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:20,729
are you fine?

600
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:22,998
god-father, are you ok?

601
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:27,595
ching Yan

602
00:42:27,771 --> 00:42:29,432
god-father!

603
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:31,402
are you fine?

604
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:32,664
are you alright?

605
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,440
are you ok?

606
00:42:35,846 --> 00:42:37,313
my god! He means yes by nodding his head

607
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:39,876
look the way you're hitting him!

608
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:40,708
You idiot!

609
00:42:41,285 --> 00:42:42,411
are you alright?

610
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,217
I'm fine!

611
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:45,480
You are great!

612
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:46,381
sure

613
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:50,683
What did you say?

614
00:42:51,295 --> 00:42:54,059
the virgin's Ice?

615
00:42:54,932 --> 00:42:55,557
Where is it?

616
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:56,395
the virgin Ice!

617
00:42:56,567 --> 00:42:56,965
that is!

618
00:42:57,134 --> 00:42:59,068
that's it! Take me over there!

619
00:43:02,506 --> 00:43:04,804
It's beautiful!

620
00:43:07,611 --> 00:43:10,910
Isn't it the virgin's Ice?

621
00:43:11,415 --> 00:43:12,677
sure it is!

622
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:14,641
We'll be rich then!

623
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,786
If we sell it to the king of evil,
we'll get 10 millions

624
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:18,955
I've got another idea

625
00:43:19,123 --> 00:43:20,021
I want to do our own business!

626
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:22,124
melt it and mix it with water,
sell it to those rich old man

627
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:23,350
to give them ever lasting life!
then we'll get more from it, right?

628
00:43:23,627 --> 00:43:24,855
good idea!

629
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:25,757
sure

630
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:28,097
bravo! Excellent idea!

631
00:43:28,866 --> 00:43:29,491
I'm sorry!

632
00:43:29,667 --> 00:43:30,429
You can't sell it!

633
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:32,465
Why not?

634
00:43:32,936 --> 00:43:33,732
You can't sell it!

635
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:34,427
Why?

636
00:43:34,772 --> 00:43:36,467
It can help me to search
for my dream lover

637
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,102
Who is going to sell it, I'll kill him

638
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,433
don't!

639
00:43:43,614 --> 00:43:46,105
shit! He's got crazy!

640
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,513
let's prepare ourselves to cheat him, ok?

641
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:58,692
for your dream

642
00:43:58,929 --> 00:43:59,657
for your lover

643
00:44:01,265 --> 00:44:03,130
for our friendship

644
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,359
We prefer supporting you...

645
00:44:05,703 --> 00:44:07,694
to the money!

646
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:13,533
What a real friend!

647
00:44:13,877 --> 00:44:17,608
fantastic!

648
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,621
the three on the ice, you're surrounded!

649
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:28,756
drop the Ice,

650
00:44:29,026 --> 00:44:30,516
or you'll be killed!

651
00:44:30,694 --> 00:44:31,661
What's it?

652
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,557
drop the Ice

653
00:44:32,996 --> 00:44:33,826
go!

654
00:44:36,734 --> 00:44:37,462
drop the Ice

655
00:44:37,835 --> 00:44:40,167
You can't rob our Ice! Let's go!

656
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:41,028
drop it!

657
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:43,331
they've no time to listen!

658
00:44:43,841 --> 00:44:45,433
let's go to the forest!

659
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:46,938
they all hear it!

660
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:48,771
stop...

661
00:44:52,316 --> 00:44:53,214
I shouted so loud that,

662
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:54,611
would they chase after us to the forest?

663
00:44:54,885 --> 00:44:55,681
I don't think so!

664
00:44:58,522 --> 00:44:59,113
let's go!

665
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,324
keep your balance!

666
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:08,926
doctor!

667
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:40,058
don't go!

668
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,197
are you giving order?

669
00:45:41,665 --> 00:45:42,290
You are nosy!

670
00:45:51,175 --> 00:45:51,937
don't go!

671
00:45:57,181 --> 00:45:57,875
take care of god father!

672
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:39,587

00:46:58,876 --> 00:46:59,843

676
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,190
What are you doing? Scaring me?

677
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,531
It's ghost-shadow fists!

678
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:22,052
You want to kill me?

679
00:48:22,926 --> 00:48:24,917

680
00:48:27,397 --> 00:48:28,989

super fists!

683
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:03,964
Where is my Ice?

684
00:49:12,876 --> 00:49:14,707
ching Yan, they robbed the Ice!

685
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:51,707
give me the Ice

686
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:56,910
You'd better leave first!

687
00:50:12,335 --> 00:50:13,700
don't come over!

688
00:50:15,405 --> 00:50:16,201
drop it

689
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:19,466
drop it

690
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:22,935
damn it!

691
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:28,711
Increase the speed

692
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:32,854
that is a fake one made by doctor!

693
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,418
come down!

694
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:48,166
do you mean it?

695
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:50,269
Yes, he is waiting us in the plane,
hurry up!

696
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,134
let's go now!

697
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,307
let's go!

698
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,908
Where is the Ice? Did doctor take it?

699
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:55,735
he did

700
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:56,344
Where is it?

701
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,012
how do I know?

702
00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:58,144
I make it invisible!

703
00:50:59,516 --> 00:50:59,948
thank you

704
00:51:10,627 --> 00:51:12,788
Isn't it an ordinary ice,

705
00:51:13,396 --> 00:51:16,297
or it contains the secret
of my dream lover?

706
00:51:19,102 --> 00:51:20,034
please tell me!

707
00:51:22,772 --> 00:51:24,399
please tell me!

708
00:51:28,111 --> 00:51:29,078
ching Yan

709
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:34,614
Is the Ice touched by my sincerity?

710
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:36,050
this way!

711
00:51:36,286 --> 00:51:37,412
It's your door which is touched by me

712
00:51:37,787 --> 00:51:39,084
When you left me last time,

713
00:51:39,322 --> 00:51:40,880
you left a love letter

714
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:43,491
I was touched after reading it

715
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:47,456
I didn't send you any love letter

716
00:51:49,633 --> 00:51:50,565
What do you want to do here?

717
00:51:50,901 --> 00:51:53,529
do? I haven't done anything!

718
00:51:56,473 --> 00:52:03,174
You want me to do that?

719
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:05,411
Why did you turn off the light?

720
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:06,616
I feel shy!

721
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:07,875
me too

722
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:09,944
no one can see it

723
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:12,047
It's so dark! We can do nothing!

724
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:13,183
Where is he going?

725
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:14,613
sorry!

726
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:18,650
don't go! Don't hide up!

727
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:19,753
You can't find me in darkness

728
00:52:22,432 --> 00:52:23,330
come down!

729
00:52:29,539 --> 00:52:30,005
miss!

730
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:34,207
I won't surrender!

731
00:52:34,778 --> 00:52:36,336
You are too hard-hearted!

732
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:41,346
miss!

733
00:52:42,686 --> 00:52:44,085
I treat you so good,

734
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:46,784
I can't imagine you are so cool to me

735
00:52:47,657 --> 00:52:50,125
I can't imagine
I don't want to leave this room

736
00:52:50,894 --> 00:52:52,987
Why do you want me to leave?

737
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:56,021
I can't imagine that
I am willing to leave this room

738
00:52:56,666 --> 00:52:58,497
so many things that are unexpected

739
00:53:00,003 --> 00:53:01,129
ruby is right!

740
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:05,035
so many things are unexpected
in this world

741
00:53:06,343 --> 00:53:08,743
to get this virgin's Ice

742
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:11,077
It's out of my expectation

743
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:13,504
but about madam,

744
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:15,377
about my love to you,

745
00:53:15,619 --> 00:53:16,847
can you even feel a little bit of it?

746
00:53:17,454 --> 00:53:19,945
It's pointless! It's not reasonable!

747
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:23,489
Want a riot?

748
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:35,502
I am not ruby

749
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:36,730
Your virgin's Ice,

750
00:53:36,906 --> 00:53:37,873
it is now in the life terminal

751
00:53:39,876 --> 00:53:41,241
I can live forever!

752
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:42,908
I will be beautiful!

753
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:45,207
let's go!

754
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:34,928
It's ching Yan!

755
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:35,529
god-father!

756
00:54:36,866 --> 00:54:37,855
forget about me!

757
00:54:40,637 --> 00:54:41,262
doctor, take it

758
00:54:42,806 --> 00:54:43,704
What happened?

759
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:44,907
What a mess is it?

760
00:54:45,442 --> 00:54:46,773
Who are you? How dare you come?

761
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:48,201
don't get mad

762
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:00,150
go, hurry up!

763
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:01,119
tim, go!

764
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:34,889
What shall we do now?

765
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:05,654
If you don't want to die, drop the ice

766
00:56:06,356 --> 00:56:07,288
shall we listen to him?

767
00:56:07,824 --> 00:56:09,382
Why don't you ask for my opinion
in other matters?

768
00:56:10,794 --> 00:56:11,954
since he is not paying attention to us,
make it invisible first

769
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:13,393
I will block their way

770
00:56:18,935 --> 00:56:20,061
don't let them go

771
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:22,201
tim, open the door, quick!

772
00:56:23,506 --> 00:56:24,666
It can't help, turn back!

773
00:56:26,509 --> 00:56:27,976
shit, I am caught by them

774
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,735
ching Yan, save me!

775
00:56:32,749 --> 00:56:33,374
hold it

776
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:38,481
let them go!

777
00:56:39,322 --> 00:56:39,947
damn it!

778
00:56:47,597 --> 00:56:48,529
let them go!

779
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:49,823
give me the Ice,
then I will let them go!

780
00:57:31,107 --> 00:57:31,766
damn!

781
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:32,869
damn!

782
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:33,801
shit!

783
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,668
no big deal! I have fixed them up!

784
00:57:35,945 --> 00:57:36,912
the Ice is robbed by them

785
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,876
Yes! Yes!

786
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:39,472
give me back the Ice!

787
00:57:40,116 --> 00:57:42,949
I have got the Ice now,
you are useless to me then

788
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:43,912
go to hell!

789
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:46,546
are you fine?

790
00:57:46,823 --> 00:57:47,084
I am alright

791
00:57:47,257 --> 00:57:48,155
You are useless!

792
00:57:48,625 --> 00:57:50,616
try the gastric juice of mine!

793
00:57:51,227 --> 00:57:51,750
I suck!

794
00:57:52,028 --> 00:57:52,926
be careful!

795
00:57:56,266 --> 00:57:57,324
ching Yan, save us!

796
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,489
doctor!

797
00:57:59,302 --> 00:57:59,996
It's hot!

798
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:02,502
I want to burn you to death!

799
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:04,773
no way!

800
00:58:10,446 --> 00:58:11,310
hold on!

801
00:58:13,516 --> 00:58:14,448
use some force!

802
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:24,122
doctor, madam appears!

803
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:55,448
ching Yan

804
00:58:55,525 --> 00:58:58,790
help me...

805
00:59:15,812 --> 00:59:17,279
the virgin's Ice?

806
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,272
give me the "essence air"!

807
00:59:19,749 --> 00:59:22,411
I won't give it
to a cruel monster like you!

808
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:24,447
no! I will kill you one by one

809
00:59:25,555 --> 00:59:26,647
take ching Yan away, hurry up!

810
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:32,627
If you don't give me the "essence air",
I will take it myself

811
00:59:59,088 --> 00:59:59,986
eat this, god-father

812
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,519
how are you?

813
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,252
the medicine isn't that good to him

814
01:00:06,029 --> 01:00:06,723
do you have another type?

815
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,094
another type?

816
01:00:08,364 --> 01:00:09,023
hurry up

817
01:00:09,265 --> 01:00:10,129
Yes, I have some others

818
01:00:11,668 --> 01:00:12,464
just try this

819
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:13,327
I don't want it

820
01:00:15,138 --> 01:00:15,934
here it is

821
01:00:20,643 --> 01:00:21,541
come on, take this

822
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:24,173
eat it, it's gyrophora

823
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:25,073
It's useless

824
01:00:25,314 --> 01:00:26,042
come on, take this

825
01:00:26,883 --> 01:00:28,077
save it when it is needed

826
01:00:28,317 --> 01:00:30,945
I know it's useless,
but it can last for a short time

827
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:31,848
doctor is great,

828
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:33,282
he will save you

829
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:38,855
I am useless, I have no idea

830
01:00:39,195 --> 01:00:40,594
You always have many inventions!

831
01:00:40,963 --> 01:00:42,191
now, you have not even one solution!

832
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,126
I won't care!

833
01:00:43,433 --> 01:00:45,765
If you can't think out any method,
he will die

834
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:47,664
think out some ways!

835
01:00:48,037 --> 01:00:51,768
tim, man will die anyway

836
01:00:53,509 --> 01:00:54,635
I am older than you,

837
01:00:55,244 --> 01:00:56,609
I will die before you

838
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,049
I am even older,
why don't I die before you?

839
01:01:00,316 --> 01:01:01,578
buy, anyway...

840
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:05,387
It's me who is nosy,
it's me who is greedy for money

841
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:08,286
If not,

842
01:01:08,658 --> 01:01:10,057
we would not go for the Ice

843
01:01:10,927 --> 01:01:12,758
You would not have met your dream lover

844
01:01:13,463 --> 01:01:15,454
You would not die

845
01:01:16,099 --> 01:01:19,034
don't cry!

846
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:22,399
In this world,

847
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:30,138
how many people can fine his dream...

848
01:01:30,913 --> 01:01:32,175
before his death?

849
01:01:33,416 --> 01:01:34,974
luckily, I am one of them

850
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:37,786
I am too happy!

851
01:01:40,356 --> 01:01:41,880
I want to thank you

852
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:44,988
don't die!

853
01:01:48,197 --> 01:01:49,664
I miss you most

854
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:53,498
I miss you two!

855
01:01:58,107 --> 01:02:01,634
tim, after my death

856
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:09,083
You should take care of yourself. Got it

857
01:02:11,821 --> 01:02:13,982
do you remember the morning exercise?

858
01:02:14,223 --> 01:02:15,019
no!

859
01:02:15,458 --> 01:02:16,925
I won't remember if you are not with me

860
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:18,093
You can't do that

861
01:02:19,529 --> 01:02:20,826
I will teach you once more

862
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:24,765
follow me

863
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:31,539
hold me, come on

864
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:39,538
are you ready?

865
01:02:39,715 --> 01:02:40,511
Yes

866
01:02:59,402 --> 01:03:01,131
You are getting smarter and smarter

867
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:07,642
doctor, I feel regret for one thing

868
01:03:08,878 --> 01:03:11,574
tim and I haven't taken
any picture together

869
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:14,605
can you take a picture for us?

870
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:20,522
please! Come on

871
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:23,816
ready?

872
01:03:31,868 --> 01:03:35,304
let me take a look!

873
01:03:38,474 --> 01:03:40,465
let me take a look!

874
01:03:46,716 --> 01:03:48,115
Why? Why?

875
01:03:57,226 --> 01:04:03,028
get up, god-father!

876
01:04:03,733 --> 01:04:05,997
get up, don't leave us!

877
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:11,865
god-father...

878
01:04:13,142 --> 01:04:14,234
It's your fault!

879
01:04:16,045 --> 01:04:19,446
give me back my god-father!

880
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:21,742
stay calm,
your god-father has just passed away!

881
01:04:45,174 --> 01:04:48,143
since he is dead,
I want to accompany him

882
01:07:59,635 --> 01:08:01,796
I have sent him the "essence air"

883
01:08:02,671 --> 01:08:04,104
You mean the air...

884
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:06,774
which the king of evil wants
by all means?

885
01:08:07,843 --> 01:08:10,778
Yes, he will soon recover

886
01:08:11,147 --> 01:08:13,581
so you can stay with god-father forever!

887
01:08:14,617 --> 01:08:15,675
forever?

888
01:08:16,785 --> 01:08:19,481
the essence air means my life

889
01:08:20,589 --> 01:08:22,386
I will die soon

890
01:08:22,858 --> 01:08:23,586
madam!

891
01:08:23,893 --> 01:08:25,952
If ching Yan knows it,
he will be very upset

892
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:29,327
When he wakes up,
he is protected by the essence air,

893
01:08:29,498 --> 01:08:31,125
nothing can harm him

894
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,296
but he can't defeat the king of evil,
don't let him go

895
01:08:35,504 --> 01:08:36,471
how are you?

896
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:38,529
don't let him see me!

897
01:08:39,508 --> 01:08:41,908
all because of "love"

898
01:09:00,362 --> 01:09:03,661
madam...

899
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:08,195
Where is doctor?

900
01:09:09,205 --> 01:09:12,038
doctor, tim!

901
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:22,612
doctor, doctor, tim!

902
01:09:25,988 --> 01:09:27,114
I know you are here!

903
01:09:28,857 --> 01:09:31,690
come out! Come out!

904
01:09:34,063 --> 01:09:37,089
don't you want to come out?

905
01:09:37,499 --> 01:09:38,466
I will wait you here

906
01:09:42,371 --> 01:09:43,599
I will wait till you come out!

907
01:09:45,074 --> 01:09:46,268
until you tell me...

908
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:47,739
where my madam is

909
01:10:19,575 --> 01:10:21,475
We won't have food!

910
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:32,544
If you don't tell me where madam is,

911
01:10:32,888 --> 01:10:36,483
I won't let you sleep,
I won't let you eat!

912
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,818
come out!

913
01:10:49,305 --> 01:10:52,536
I am hungry!

914
01:10:54,443 --> 01:10:57,412
surrender!

915
01:10:58,681 --> 01:11:01,878
We can't compete with the power of love!

916
01:11:02,117 --> 01:11:03,084
no!

917
01:11:06,322 --> 01:11:10,190
Well, tell me where madam is

918
01:11:10,359 --> 01:11:11,223
then I will let you eat!

919
01:11:14,229 --> 01:11:17,687
You want woman? I can find you some!

920
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:18,696
tell me!

921
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:23,530
ching Yan, take it easy!

922
01:11:23,706 --> 01:11:25,697
It's just a dream!

923
01:11:26,075 --> 01:11:28,942
for your dream, for your madam,

924
01:11:29,111 --> 01:11:31,579
you have nearly lost your life!

925
01:11:33,716 --> 01:11:36,617
Your madam have made us in a mess too!

926
01:11:36,785 --> 01:11:37,217
do you agree?

927
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:38,045
Yes...

928
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:40,549
suicide?

929
01:11:44,326 --> 01:11:46,260
If you don't tell me where she is,

930
01:11:47,296 --> 01:11:48,593
I prefer dying in front of you

931
01:11:49,698 --> 01:11:51,529
You will regret it

932
01:11:56,205 --> 01:11:57,968
she may be inside

933
01:11:59,708 --> 01:12:02,541
pal, although the truth may hurt you,

934
01:12:03,278 --> 01:12:05,838
listen to me, stop seeking your dream

935
01:12:08,784 --> 01:12:09,808
thank you

936
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:12,211
get lost!

937
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:25,395
pal, although the truth may hurt you,

938
01:12:25,801 --> 01:12:29,032
listen to me, stop seeking your dream

939
01:12:29,905 --> 01:12:31,202
get lost!

940
01:12:38,113 --> 01:12:41,014
pal, although the truth may hurt you,

941
01:12:41,183 --> 01:12:43,777
listen to me, stop seeking your dream

942
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:46,719
get lost,

943
01:12:52,461 --> 01:12:55,988
pal, although the truth may hurt you,

944
01:12:56,298 --> 01:12:58,823
listen to me, stop seeking your dream

945
01:13:00,035 --> 01:13:01,832
get lost!

946
01:13:20,222 --> 01:13:21,086
madam

947
01:13:22,257 --> 01:13:24,851
go now, she won't see you

948
01:13:25,627 --> 01:13:26,594
Why?

949
01:13:27,563 --> 01:13:28,552
What happened?

950
01:13:28,964 --> 01:13:29,760
tell me please

951
01:13:31,099 --> 01:13:32,031
Where is she?

952
01:13:32,835 --> 01:13:35,963
If you see her again,
you may not love her anymore

953
01:13:36,572 --> 01:13:37,402
no

954
01:13:37,906 --> 01:13:40,170
no matter how she has changed,

955
01:13:41,777 --> 01:13:43,301
no matter what has happened,

956
01:13:44,413 --> 01:13:48,349
I love her, this is the truth

957
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,578
come in

958
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:57,821
granny, look

959
01:13:58,727 --> 01:14:02,493
these are the information
about my dreams

960
01:14:04,933 --> 01:14:06,764
from the day I was born

961
01:14:07,636 --> 01:14:10,799
every night, I see madam in my dream

962
01:14:14,276 --> 01:14:15,937
We grew up together

963
01:14:18,213 --> 01:14:19,874
We went to school together

964
01:14:21,984 --> 01:14:23,144
We love each other

965
01:14:24,887 --> 01:14:26,149
We fall deeply for each other

966
01:14:27,823 --> 01:14:29,757
till we get marry, I swear!

967
01:14:30,792 --> 01:14:32,282
even she is 80 years old

968
01:14:34,296 --> 01:14:36,264
I still love her

969
01:14:42,337 --> 01:14:45,966
I think you understand my heart!

970
01:15:02,624 --> 01:15:03,818
You are madam

971
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:12,660
madam!

972
01:15:15,938 --> 01:15:19,032
do you still love me?

973
01:15:21,343 --> 01:15:22,503
marry me!

974
01:15:23,579 --> 01:15:24,705
I am really touched!

975
01:17:27,302 --> 01:17:30,465
I was wrong to tell the king of evil
where the virgin's Ice was

976
01:17:30,706 --> 01:17:31,968
but, this time,

977
01:17:32,307 --> 01:17:33,968
I am so generous to send them present
for their wedding,

978
01:17:34,142 --> 01:17:36,235
I think ching Yan will forgive me

979
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:45,481
they captured madam!

980
01:17:50,892 --> 01:17:52,257
ching Yan!

981
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:56,022
after the swim,

982
01:17:56,498 --> 01:17:58,398
I feel better now

983
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,066
really?

984
01:18:00,602 --> 01:18:03,196
kidding! Why they need
such a big fire for barbecue?

985
01:18:03,405 --> 01:18:05,873
no! God-father is on fire!

986
01:18:06,641 --> 01:18:08,006
What? Our ship is on fire!

987
01:18:08,176 --> 01:18:09,074
god-father!

988
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:10,005
ching Yan!

989
01:18:10,245 --> 01:18:10,802
ching Yan!

990
01:18:13,615 --> 01:18:14,377
god-father!

991
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:18,077
let me go in!

992
01:18:18,553 --> 01:18:19,281
don't! You will be burnt!

993
01:18:23,692 --> 01:18:24,852
ching Yan, where are you?

994
01:18:30,432 --> 01:18:34,869
ching Yan, don't die! Don't leave us!

995
01:18:36,571 --> 01:18:37,663
What are you doing?

996
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,107
I am sleeping!

997
01:18:39,341 --> 01:18:41,104
Why did you wake me up?

998
01:18:41,376 --> 01:18:42,866
the ship exploded!

999
01:18:43,145 --> 01:18:44,442
You were burning!

1000
01:18:45,113 --> 01:18:45,909
What?

1001
01:18:48,383 --> 01:18:49,441
Why didn't I hurt?

1002
01:18:51,386 --> 01:18:52,080
madam!

1003
01:18:55,423 --> 01:18:57,448
I wonder what madam told us was true

1004
01:18:57,692 --> 01:18:58,181
let's try

1005
01:18:58,660 --> 01:19:00,127
fine!

1006
01:19:00,762 --> 01:19:02,457
madam... how are you?

1007
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:04,826
how can I face others?

1008
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:05,762
my face is ruined!

1009
01:19:05,934 --> 01:19:06,866
no matter how you changed,

1010
01:19:07,135 --> 01:19:08,193
I still love you

1011
01:19:08,436 --> 01:19:10,427
my god, my face is ruined!

1012
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:11,330
let me have a look!

1013
01:19:15,477 --> 01:19:16,000
Who are you?

1014
01:19:16,578 --> 01:19:17,545
I am ruby

1015
01:19:18,446 --> 01:19:20,175
Why did you pretend to be madam?

1016
01:19:21,383 --> 01:19:23,510
I just want...

1017
01:19:23,685 --> 01:19:26,153
cut the crap,
let me cure your face first

1018
01:19:34,863 --> 01:19:35,420
can you?

1019
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:36,255
sure!

1020
01:19:36,464 --> 01:19:37,055
let me try

1021
01:19:55,483 --> 01:19:56,313
he is not hurt!

1022
01:19:56,484 --> 01:19:57,382
he is fine!

1023
01:19:58,954 --> 01:19:59,545
What are you doing?

1024
01:19:59,821 --> 01:20:00,981
nothing, just practise kung-fu

1025
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:02,349
ching Yan!

1026
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:05,282
madam is caught by the king of evil

1027
01:20:11,399 --> 01:20:13,264
kill me!

1028
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:16,870
If he knows
the "essence air" is kept with you,

1029
01:20:17,205 --> 01:20:18,695
he will tempt you to save madam

1030
01:20:19,174 --> 01:20:20,732
It's dangerous for you to go alone

1031
01:20:21,343 --> 01:20:23,607
I don't care, I just want to save madam

1032
01:20:24,512 --> 01:20:27,777
I hope you can help me

1033
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,642
guard the exit of the evil's palace,
don't let anyone go out

1034
01:20:31,219 --> 01:20:32,481
You should take care

1035
01:22:37,345 --> 01:22:38,835
I don't care who you are

1036
01:22:39,414 --> 01:22:40,642
If you don't hand me my madam

1037
01:22:40,915 --> 01:22:42,576
I want you to die terribly

1038
01:22:42,817 --> 01:22:44,444
You do have guts!

1039
01:22:44,919 --> 01:22:45,715
give the "essence air" back to me

1040
01:22:46,087 --> 01:22:47,679
give me back my wife,
and I will let you go

1041
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,158
come to the horrible valley with me
if you have guts

1042
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:54,018
damn it!

1043
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,031
madam!

1044
01:23:03,638 --> 01:23:04,070
madam...

1045
01:23:13,248 --> 01:23:14,146
madam...

1046
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:24,214
Wait for me, madam

1047
01:24:47,976 --> 01:24:49,136
doctor, kiss him!

1048
01:24:51,112 --> 01:24:53,512
god-father, give madam the essence air

1049
01:26:26,841 --> 01:26:29,002
ching Yan!

1050
01:26:48,363 --> 01:26:49,227
madam!

1051
01:26:54,869 --> 01:26:55,893
It's not long enough, longer!

1052
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:00,037
save madam, quick!

1053
01:27:00,975 --> 01:27:01,737
ching Yan!

1054
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:06,876
help me!

1055
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:25,229
bravo, the king of evil is killed!

1056
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,424
bravo!

1057
01:27:33,408 --> 01:27:34,739
ching Yan!

1058
01:27:49,290 --> 01:27:52,521
go now, he will soon explode!

1059
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:28,190
ching Yan!

1060
01:28:35,503 --> 01:28:37,903
how are you? Answer me please!

1061
01:28:42,143 --> 01:28:42,939
ching Yan!

1062
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:48,343
I am still alive!

1063
01:28:50,351 --> 01:28:52,842
before I meet madam,

1064
01:28:53,888 --> 01:28:55,549
I won't die!

1065
01:29:04,065 --> 01:29:08,399
You are the same as you are in my dream

1066
01:29:08,569 --> 01:29:09,536
It's not necessary for you to do so!

1067
01:29:09,771 --> 01:29:10,635
do you know?

1068
01:29:11,939 --> 01:29:13,429
there is a butterfly,

1069
01:29:14,008 --> 01:29:18,445
it can live only 24 hours, it is born
in the morning, and die at night

1070
01:29:19,814 --> 01:29:22,408
It lives for finding its better half,

1071
01:29:23,651 --> 01:29:25,243
understand?

1072
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:32,115
I am willing to do so

1073
01:29:34,862 --> 01:29:35,556
god-father...

1074
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:37,857
ching Yan!

1075
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,305
I saved him

1076
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:50,875
he saved me too

1077
01:29:52,013 --> 01:29:53,810
the essence air is enough
for one person only

1078
01:29:54,649 --> 01:29:56,048
how can we share it?

1079
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:02,456
What shall I do?

1080
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:18,861
give him to me

1081
01:30:49,070 --> 01:30:50,059
from that day onwards

1082
01:30:50,304 --> 01:30:52,033
We have never seen them

1083
01:30:52,273 --> 01:30:53,797
because she sent ching Yan...

1084
01:30:54,008 --> 01:30:55,270
to the coldest place of the world

1085
01:30:55,443 --> 01:30:56,467
to keep his life

1086
01:30:56,644 --> 01:30:57,941
do you know where are they?

1087
01:30:58,312 --> 01:31:00,473
an adventurer did see a couple
near the cliff in the south pole,

1088
01:31:00,648 --> 01:31:03,776
I think they are the couple mentioned
