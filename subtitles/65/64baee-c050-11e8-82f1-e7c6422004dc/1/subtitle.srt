1
00:01:56,763 --> 00:01:59,823
Wash, wash away what's mundane.

2
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,524
What's boring and what's vile.

3
00:02:03,636 --> 00:02:06,901
Wash, wash and let snowy skin shine.

4
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:10,338
Wash, wash off the heat,

5
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:13,742
the hot and the bad air.

6
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:17,305
lt's great, really great!

7
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:27,689
Wash, wash until
one's happy all over,

8
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:31,161
and human traits are restored.

9
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,664
Pure, simon pure, one's soaring.

10
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:38,135
Cleaned thoroughly
and snowy all over.

11
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:41,264
A bath is great, really great.

12
00:02:41,474 --> 00:02:44,932
Great, truly great.

13
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:48,569
Great, wondrously great!

14
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,116
What a relief to clean off all
hatred with acrimonious out of way.

15
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:28,920
Could this be the will of Heaven?

16
00:03:58,818 --> 00:03:59,876
Go faster!

17
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,867
Faster!

18
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,014
Master.

19
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,280
Watch out!

20
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:05,775
Suang.

21
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:08,515
What's the matter, Miss?

22
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,489
We should've arrived but hadn't!

23
00:05:16,062 --> 00:05:17,222
lt's getting dark.

24
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:21,124
You cry at start of wedding trip.

25
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,064
But you're yearning to get married.

26
00:05:23,236 --> 00:05:26,501
l'm bored inside the sedan.

27
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,607
Miss, bear with it!

28
00:05:30,043 --> 00:05:33,706
They say the groom is a scholar.

29
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:35,710
He can even compose verses.

30
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:40,017
You're going to be a happy couple.

31
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:42,347
Suang, don't be a gossip!

32
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,056
Porters, hurry up!

33
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:49,355
Our lady is impatient.

34
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:50,791
All right.

35
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:07,947
Suang, what happened?

36
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,743
Nothing, Miss!

37
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:13,318
Don't ever come out; it's taboo.

38
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:33,103
Yama's here to snatch a bride.

39
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,841
Please don't go.

40
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,775
Miss.

41
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,744
Please let her go,

42
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,280
l beg you.

43
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:39,798
l'll get you, dead or alive.

44
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:06,457
A bright moonlight before the bed.
Could...

45
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:09,466
Ghost?

46
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:50,573
What are you up to?

47
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,974
What are you up to?

48
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:55,812
Are you mute?

49
00:08:59,652 --> 00:09:01,517
This is my gem.

50
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,019
What are you doing at this hour?

51
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:09,161
lf you're seeking donations, sorry!

52
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:16,033
What does this gesticulation mean?

53
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,027
l can't help you.

54
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,065
l've starved for days.

55
00:09:26,012 --> 00:09:29,880
A gentleman is not covetous.

56
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:44,152
Man is by nature kind.

57
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,166
Man is by nature kind.

58
00:09:57,143 --> 00:09:58,804
lt's cold!

59
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,571
Old gentleman, come and take shelter.

60
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:08,618
l don't mind any visitors.

61
00:10:08,721 --> 00:10:11,087
Except...

62
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:14,126
Could he have left when the rain stopped?

63
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,053
What did you say?

64
00:10:17,196 --> 00:10:19,061
Never mind. Drop in!

65
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:24,627
You're cold.

66
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,264
l'll get you hot tea.

67
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,879
Old sir, let me do it.

68
00:10:40,052 --> 00:10:42,612
Drop in!

69
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,254
Take care!

70
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,418
The blanket will kept you warm.

71
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,742
Don't try anything foolish.

72
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,581
Get going, old gentleman.

73
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,880
Keep away!

74
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:19,783
He looks poor. He couldn't be rich.

75
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,586
Want to murder?

76
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,524
l've never seen
a more unreasonable man.

77
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:37,404
Get going, old gentleman.

78
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:39,237
Don't worry, l'll protect you!

79
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:39,419
Don't push me out.
l must get back the books.

80
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:41,394
My book!

81
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:44,333
Don't tug at me!

82
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:46,095
My book!

83
00:13:47,473 --> 00:13:48,531
My book!

84
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:53,269
Don't take away my books, my house.

85
00:13:53,979 --> 00:13:55,844
Don't take away my books.

86
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,249
Give it back to me.

87
00:14:04,857 --> 00:14:07,121
Give it back to me! Hear me?

88
00:14:08,894 --> 00:14:10,555
He must be deaf and dumb.

89
00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:12,697
You can't understand?

90
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:19,200
Look, please give it back to me.

91
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:20,929
Thank you.

92
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:27,944
Foolish you.

93
00:14:29,748 --> 00:14:31,613
When are you going to
return them to me?

94
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,177
Priest's son.

95
00:14:33,285 --> 00:14:36,550
Run!

96
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:44,188
Priest's son's here. Get going.

97
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:48,599
Priest's son's here. Get going.

98
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:01,172
Better keep away from
this kind of man.

99
00:15:04,016 --> 00:15:05,483
Go faster!

100
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:17,559
Sister!

101
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,699
Uncle, you're buying the etui again!

102
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:28,431
Thank you.

103
00:15:47,126 --> 00:15:49,390
Priest's son's here. Get going.

104
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:51,427
The ghost-catcher's son's here.
Get going.

105
00:15:51,564 --> 00:15:52,622
Go!

106
00:16:08,914 --> 00:16:10,677
He doesn't seem to be so awful.

107
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,220
You've dropped it.

108
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,999
You burned my house.

109
00:16:30,135 --> 00:16:32,603
Where can l sleep?

110
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:36,966
You know?

111
00:16:39,678 --> 00:16:41,441
How long can l live there?

112
00:16:42,181 --> 00:16:43,546
Without A Gate?

113
00:16:43,782 --> 00:16:45,647
Without A Gate,
how can l have a home?

114
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,285
How observation.

115
00:16:47,686 --> 00:16:50,746
Anyone wanting to be a hero
is observation.

116
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,830
The house seems unoccupied.

117
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:57,947
Splendid!

118
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:01,024
This is the best house
l've ever lived.

119
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:04,760
l'm really grateful to you.

120
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:06,660
Please accept my salute.

121
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:18,938
He's quite a good guy.

122
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:21,945
Why are the people in town
afraid of him?

123
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:53,977
Scholars are highest
in social standing.

124
00:18:55,848 --> 00:19:01,616
Penniless,
they write priceless words.

125
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,618
Let me dry the rain-soaked scrolls.

126
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,459
Thank you.

127
00:20:07,152 --> 00:20:08,210
What is it?

128
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:10,815
So he's coming.

129
00:20:12,658 --> 00:20:16,116
l'll sell this. See you in a minute.

130
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:21,957
Priest's son.

131
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,147
lt's quite valuable.

132
00:20:41,854 --> 00:20:43,617
l already gave my article's valuable

133
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,552
l also knew l'd win recognition.

134
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,157
Well, boss, take it!

135
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,390
Good, this amount!

136
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:52,730
How much is it?

137
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,230
5 cents.

138
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,862
5 cents?

139
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:57,128
Yes.

140
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:03,274
Good!

141
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,844
You must be reconciled to
humiliation.

142
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:08,844
After being put into print,

143
00:21:09,081 --> 00:21:10,946
it might be a hit.

144
00:21:11,183 --> 00:21:13,344
l know you have talent.

145
00:21:13,585 --> 00:21:15,951
l admire you too. Try hard next time

146
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:18,754
Take care!

147
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,688
Boss, so you're taking it for tissue

148
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:30,995
That's not fair. lt's a masterpiece!

149
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:32,227
Masterpiece?

150
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:34,805
Who'd read this stuff?

151
00:21:34,907 --> 00:21:37,034
l bought it out of charity only.

152
00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:43,310
l'd rather die than take your money.

153
00:21:44,449 --> 00:21:46,007
What a hare brain.

154
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:37,761
Money and power can be set ablaze,

155
00:23:37,996 --> 00:23:39,861
but not love.

156
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:42,895
Don't burn it.

157
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:49,403
No way. No one will enjoy it.

158
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,940
What's a scholar?
l'll burn it out all.

159
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,272
Don't burn it.

160
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:56,948
Burn it!

161
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,810
Out of my way.

162
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,349
All rubbish, burn it all.

163
00:24:04,322 --> 00:24:06,381
l'll burn it all.

164
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,122
Fire...

165
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:50,530
Beans can be made into soup.

166
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:59,332
Well, l'll sell beancurd soup,
not compositions.

167
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:52,821
A bridal dress.

168
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:59,169
Had planned to get married.

169
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:02,371
Only to be snatched by King ghost.

170
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:07,536
l tried to jump to death.

171
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,848
lnstead, l become a roaming spirit.

172
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:15,677
He kept on chasing me.

173
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:18,351
What should l do?

174
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:45,416
Where are you, Miss?

175
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:51,217
You died so tragically.

176
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:57,351
No clean soil on earth,
l'll send you one.

177
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:02,798
Retired and take no interest in
mundane affairs!

178
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,712
Miss?

179
00:27:21,987 --> 00:27:24,547
Miss...

180
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,558
Nonsense!

181
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:29,920
Can't you see l have moustache?
Between the sexes?

182
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,595
Don't you know the etiquette.

183
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,770
Please do help our mistress.

184
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:43,338
l dreamed she was pursued by ghosts.

185
00:27:44,075 --> 00:27:45,940
There's nothing. l can do.

186
00:27:46,077 --> 00:27:49,376
Ghosts won't mind you,
unless offended.

187
00:27:51,182 --> 00:27:53,241
Don't be silly.
Get out of here at once!

188
00:27:53,451 --> 00:27:55,612
There are lots of evils here.
Go now.

189
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:08,796
Miss...

190
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,468
Wait for me, Miss.

191
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:42,732
l'll be able to see Miss soon.

192
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,635
King Ghost?

193
00:29:53,838 --> 00:29:58,002
Let me see if you've aged.

194
00:29:58,743 --> 00:30:00,108
Trying to bewitch me?

195
00:30:01,112 --> 00:30:03,580
Dare not to look at me?

196
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,545
Come on!

197
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:09,344
Not too old, after all.

198
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:11,152
Sense ofjustice.

199
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,482
Sense ofjustice?

200
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:15,288
Evil now reigns supreme.

201
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:16,894
Why talk about justice?

202
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:20,629
A heavenly match.
You defy rules of nature,

203
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:23,859
and have harmed so many brides.

204
00:30:24,803 --> 00:30:30,264
l do what l like here.

205
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:34,310
You'd better behave.

206
00:30:37,715 --> 00:30:40,650
l'm not afraid of trouble.

207
00:30:40,952 --> 00:30:43,819
l'm not afraid of death.

208
00:30:44,088 --> 00:30:45,749
Today, trouble comes my way.

209
00:30:46,191 --> 00:30:48,659
l'll settle it my way.

210
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:52,325
Too early to tell who wins.

211
00:31:17,188 --> 00:31:19,156
Naughty...

212
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:22,526
How naughty you are.

213
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,586
l'll kill you.

214
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:15,639
You're lucky.

215
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,488
- Alright.
- Priest.

216
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,591
Get going.

217
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,155
You haven't paid yet!

218
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:40,302
Give me a bowl of beancurd soup.

219
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:43,465
Why don't you go away?

220
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:48,305
Why should l? l did nothing wrong.

221
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:57,949
Sister...

222
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,682
King Ghost again?

223
00:33:00,825 --> 00:33:01,985
Sister, where are you?

224
00:33:02,193 --> 00:33:03,057
First thing is to rescue people.

225
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:07,630
You haven't paid. Don't go away.

226
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:10,295
Don't go away.

227
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,628
A wasted trip.

228
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:21,042
You've sunk deep
after several months.

229
00:33:21,913 --> 00:33:24,780
Half human and half ghost.

230
00:33:24,949 --> 00:33:26,610
Can this lousy gate offer protection

231
00:33:26,684 --> 00:33:27,742
Observation.

232
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:45,233
Where's that bastard going?

233
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,030
You may speak now.

234
00:34:55,473 --> 00:34:57,771
What happened during my absence?

235
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,274
Master, since you left,

236
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:03,437
l did many great things
besides cleaning the house.

237
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,946
First...

238
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:11,445
There was a leak on the 4th tile
on the roof.

239
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:13,283
l've fixed it already.

240
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:17,019
Besides, the staircase
doesn't creak any more.

241
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,093
Because l've also fixed it.

242
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:24,027
Time hung heavy on my hands
when you were away.

243
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:29,067
No, l mean l have time to practice,

244
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,208
and to catch ghosts too.

245
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:34,574
Master, why is the ghost fiercer
when older?

246
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:36,270
Older man becomes more difficult.

247
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:40,244
Master, you think l'm a bore?

248
00:35:46,023 --> 00:35:47,285
One more thing l must tell you is...

249
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:50,052
That old ghost has very long hair.

250
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:52,821
He yelled behind me fiercely.

251
00:35:57,935 --> 00:36:01,701
Master, l missed you daily
since you left.

252
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:05,042
All nonsense, except this.

253
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:12,415
Why are you coming back?

254
00:36:13,551 --> 00:36:14,711
What did you say?

255
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:17,252
Any more nonsense,
l'll gag you forever.

256
00:36:17,355 --> 00:36:20,324
No, l don't mean you, l...

257
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:22,426
Nothing.

258
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,033
lsn't this the Yen lmperial Mansion?

259
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,302
lt was so magnificent here,
but now...

260
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:43,347
So it's you.
Pay me for the beancurd soup.

261
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,345
What are you doing here?

262
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:47,780
lt's not right not to pay.

263
00:36:47,885 --> 00:36:50,149
People like you are the cause of
social depravity.

264
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:52,722
No wonder everyone's shunning you.

265
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,415
Think it over.

266
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:56,593
Look at you, a lousy priest.

267
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:57,886
What did you say?

268
00:36:58,062 --> 00:37:00,428
No one here wants beancurd.

269
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:01,691
Go now.

270
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:04,529
So you're not mute!

271
00:37:05,937 --> 00:37:09,498
Shih Erh, so you brought him in.

272
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:12,338
You made trouble while l was away.

273
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,477
No his fault.

274
00:37:14,946 --> 00:37:17,414
Well, let the beancurd soup charged.

275
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:19,709
Offset the rent.
lt's now even between us.

276
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:21,011
lt's not a question of money.

277
00:37:21,385 --> 00:37:23,250
Without A Gate
never admits outsiders.

278
00:37:23,387 --> 00:37:25,048
Why have you brought the trouble?

279
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:26,690
Master, l burnt his house.

280
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,051
Mind your speech.

281
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:29,284
No more nonsense.

282
00:37:30,027 --> 00:37:33,861
There must be a place for me
in this wide world.

283
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:35,532
Master.

284
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,728
Look, you did a fine thing again.

285
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,430
Don't go too far.

286
00:37:41,572 --> 00:37:42,732
l'm ready to leave.

287
00:37:42,874 --> 00:37:44,136
Why curse him?

288
00:37:50,248 --> 00:37:51,215
Master.

289
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,143
Today's Lantern Festival.

290
00:38:29,754 --> 00:38:32,314
Suang, why are you so silly?

291
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:35,986
A ghost can fare worse than a man.

292
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:42,261
Miss, with you as my companion.

293
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:44,494
l'll be satisfied.

294
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:51,339
You combed my hair
when l got married.

295
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:55,410
Miss,
l hope you'll have another lover.

296
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:58,012
Then l'll comb your hair
for you again.

297
00:38:58,582 --> 00:39:04,418
l don't even know
when l can be reincarnated.

298
00:39:04,588 --> 00:39:06,749
How can l cherish any illusion?

299
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:10,289
Miss, what day is today?

300
00:39:10,461 --> 00:39:12,122
The Lantern Festival.

301
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:15,263
Floating the Lanterns
in memory of the kin.

302
00:39:15,433 --> 00:39:19,233
Miss,
let's float lanterns and make a wish

303
00:40:37,748 --> 00:40:39,409
Don't be foolish.

304
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:44,451
Come on.

305
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:54,689
No wonder master says,
Scholars are sentimental.

306
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:56,190
Observation.

307
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:58,130
lf l were you,

308
00:40:58,302 --> 00:40:59,769
l'd have died long ago.

309
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:02,167
Go now!

310
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:04,432
Miss, l know your wish.

311
00:41:04,575 --> 00:41:06,941
Stop guessing.

312
00:41:07,344 --> 00:41:10,711
That rude scholar kept staring at us

313
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:12,980
l didn't mean that scholar.

314
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:14,151
You're sharp-tongued.

315
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:16,819
l'm not joking, l'm serious.

316
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:10,471
You know why l'm called Shih Erh?

317
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:11,699
Many thought l had 10 brothers.

318
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:13,242
ln fact, 'Shih' means 'Pick'.

319
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,071
My master picked me up
when l was an infant.

320
00:42:15,212 --> 00:42:17,476
l have neither brothers nor friends.

321
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:19,609
lf l love a girl
and dare not tell her,

322
00:42:19,783 --> 00:42:21,751
about it, what should l do?

323
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:25,986
l'm not joking, l'm serious.

324
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,251
Just go and look her up.

325
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,863
She's already married.

326
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:39,865
Life is not a bed of roses.

327
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:43,164
Persevere so long as you live.

328
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,967
Look, the future is bright.

329
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:53,641
Now the future is bleak.

330
00:42:53,784 --> 00:42:56,548
Don't worry, it's bright in my heart

331
00:42:59,823 --> 00:43:01,688
lt's just got wet.

332
00:43:12,803 --> 00:43:15,271
Don't run around. Mind the wolves.

333
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:36,784
Come back.

334
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:40,189
Light the lantern.

335
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:44,859
The candles burnt out.

336
00:43:45,035 --> 00:43:48,300
l can walk on this road,
even with closed eyes.

337
00:44:04,788 --> 00:44:07,154
l'm used to walking in the darkness.

338
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,527
Are you all right? Come on.

339
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:18,094
You said you could walk
even with closed eyes.

340
00:44:18,235 --> 00:44:20,396
Observation.
A dark road is not easy to walk.

341
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,274
Does your chest hurt?

342
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:34,742
No, it's perfectly all right.

343
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:38,312
Scholars are a nuisance!

344
00:44:39,189 --> 00:44:41,248
Don't worry,
l've already told master.

345
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:42,518
Don't keep it in mind.

346
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,253
Don't go out so often at night.

347
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,194
Remember, the rules here are:

348
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:54,702
First, no pawing around.

349
00:44:54,905 --> 00:44:56,770
Second, no loitering.

350
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:59,238
- Third...
- l must go to bed.

351
00:45:01,178 --> 00:45:02,338
Good night.

352
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:23,157
Come back.

353
00:45:25,402 --> 00:45:27,063
Master, still not in bed?

354
00:45:27,237 --> 00:45:29,705
l finished it, as ordered.

355
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:32,066
Go to bed then.

356
00:47:51,281 --> 00:47:52,441
Where?

357
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:21,135
Master.

358
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:26,507
Are you addressing me?

359
00:48:26,583 --> 00:48:28,744
Yes, l was passing through,

360
00:48:29,286 --> 00:48:33,848
and found something wrong
with this house.

361
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:37,454
Right, l feel it too.

362
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:40,761
Master, excuse my saying so.

363
00:48:41,398 --> 00:48:44,959
The trouble lies with you.

364
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:47,797
You're possessed. Understand?

365
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:51,498
All priests say the same thing.

366
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:53,610
There's no trouble other than,

367
00:48:54,478 --> 00:48:57,140
that picture in your hand.

368
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:00,178
Nonsense. How dare you?

369
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,817
Something must be wrong with you.

370
00:49:05,722 --> 00:49:06,689
What's it?

371
00:49:07,157 --> 00:49:09,318
l'm only feeling sorry for you.

372
00:49:09,726 --> 00:49:12,388
lf l bought your picture,

373
00:49:12,563 --> 00:49:15,031
you'd be safe,

374
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:16,893
and l'd take the picture away.

375
00:49:18,235 --> 00:49:21,204
Nonsense, money means nothing to me.

376
00:49:21,538 --> 00:49:23,506
lt's valuable,

377
00:49:23,674 --> 00:49:25,335
l won't sell it for anything
in the world.

378
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,936
Master,
since the painting's priceless,

379
00:49:29,212 --> 00:49:31,476
would you let me have a look?

380
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,480
But you must return it after seeing.

381
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:39,689
Don't! She is a monster.

382
00:50:36,913 --> 00:50:38,073
Watch out!

383
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:51,423
Great.
Master has knocked down her skirt.

384
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:04,736
Want me to follow her?

385
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,137
Can you beat her?

386
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,445
Luckily,
she didn't take away the gem.

387
00:51:15,052 --> 00:51:16,713
Shih Erh, you're good for nothing.

388
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:20,712
You toy with feminine items
without practicing.

389
00:51:21,425 --> 00:51:25,191
You don't understand.
These are all his loved ones...

390
00:51:26,396 --> 00:51:28,557
What? Shih Erh.

391
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:35,672
Shih Erh.

392
00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:49,881
l'll help you sell the soup
in future.

393
00:51:50,187 --> 00:51:51,848
What a pity!

394
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:55,518
My master always said l'm hopeless.

395
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:56,556
You master...

396
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,125
Don't mention about my master.

397
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,129
lt's heavy.

398
00:52:06,536 --> 00:52:08,003
Must be hard for you every day.

399
00:52:17,781 --> 00:52:18,543
Take care!

400
00:52:18,715 --> 00:52:19,875
You, too.

401
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:22,142
You look eerie, take care!

402
00:52:22,652 --> 00:52:23,710
Don't worry!

403
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,918
He's much weird.
l'll go and catch ghosts.

404
00:52:33,096 --> 00:52:35,564
Wait! Where are you going?

405
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:37,428
l'm going up to get some paper.

406
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:44,400
Master, you really want to fold it?

407
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:49,136
Master, it's a boring game.

408
00:52:51,948 --> 00:52:53,108
Can't l not fold it?

409
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:54,012
No.

410
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:56,185
Let's practice fencing.

411
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:00,850
What are you folding that for?

412
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,158
What for?

413
00:53:21,645 --> 00:53:22,907
Master, l'll fold it too.

414
00:53:23,013 --> 00:53:24,571
Master, can it fly?

415
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,308
You must fold
1,365 pieces continuously.

416
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:32,315
Folding this requires
patience and concentration.

417
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,481
Keep your mind on the paper crane.

418
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:37,024
l know, and put my heart to it too.

419
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:38,456
Don't talk feelings to me.

420
00:53:38,628 --> 00:53:41,688
l have no feelings, only for wine!

421
00:53:41,798 --> 00:53:43,356
To put wine feelings into it?

422
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,931
Nonsense! Fold!

423
00:53:57,614 --> 00:54:02,278
Thank you.

424
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:15,297
So beancurd soup sells better than
essays.

425
00:54:17,634 --> 00:54:20,694
Another girl was caught by
King Ghost.

426
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:23,531
She knew that,
or she wouldn't have married him.

427
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:34,247
King Ghost's cruel;
he steals brides.

428
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:36,078
l told you not to talk behind
other's backs.

429
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:38,084
People may hear it.

430
00:54:38,288 --> 00:54:39,448
Yes is yes.

431
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,522
Yes...

432
00:54:45,528 --> 00:54:47,291
Yes is yes.

433
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:52,295
Who'll be the next bride?

434
00:54:52,435 --> 00:54:54,096
The daughter of Mrs. Li, l think.

435
00:54:54,271 --> 00:54:57,138
You'd better watch out.

436
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:58,100
Are you all right, Miss?

437
00:55:58,268 --> 00:55:59,633
You made me blind.

438
00:56:00,003 --> 00:56:01,163
lmpossible!

439
00:56:02,272 --> 00:56:05,332
l'll help you, take care.

440
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:09,512
l'm thirsty,
l want to drink beancurd soup.

441
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:17,053
Sorry, my beancurd soup's sold out.

442
00:56:17,253 --> 00:56:18,811
Take beancurd then.

443
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,317
There's no beancurd either.

444
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:22,718
Let me grind it for you.

445
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:25,793
Miss, it's very late now.

446
00:56:26,496 --> 00:56:28,157
You'd better go home!

447
00:56:28,765 --> 00:56:30,528
This is my home.

448
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:31,831
This?

449
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,403
Master, when l listen to your voice,
l know you're handsome.

450
00:56:34,571 --> 00:56:36,232
- Let me touch...
- Miss, don't!

451
00:56:37,007 --> 00:56:38,167
l must take a close look at you.

452
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:40,636
Let me find it back.

453
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:42,340
Here it is.

454
00:56:49,152 --> 00:56:51,211
Master, don't go away.

455
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,990
Master, you're very handsome.

456
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:24,684
You said you were not afraid.

457
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:27,115
l didn't say that,
but l don't believe.

458
00:57:27,457 --> 00:57:29,015
Do you believe it now?

459
00:57:29,759 --> 00:57:32,319
Facing you every day,
l can't help believing.

460
00:57:32,896 --> 00:57:34,056
Halt!

461
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:39,595
What are you doing?

462
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:42,700
Only a joke!

463
00:57:42,906 --> 00:57:44,066
Don't put on airs.

464
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:46,807
Have you seen Shih Erh?

465
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:47,874
Are you looking for him?

466
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:49,069
Nonsense!

467
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,474
l'll tell him if l see him.

468
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:55,382
Don't tell him l'm looking for him.

469
00:57:56,152 --> 00:57:57,414
Nonsense!

470
00:58:00,857 --> 00:58:02,017
Damn Priest.

471
00:58:42,866 --> 00:58:44,731
Shih Erh, what are you doing here?

472
00:58:46,202 --> 00:58:48,261
Master told me fold cranes here.

473
00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:50,200
Where you away just now?

474
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,602
Master has been looking for you
everywhere.

475
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,467
l was out to see Master. Don't
tell him l've been looking for him.

476
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:01,245
The master and pupil are funny.

477
00:59:53,203 --> 00:59:56,764
Shih Erh, thanks for
tidying up the house for me.

478
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:00,107
What? l haven't even has time
to clean my own.

479
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:02,671
Who did it then?

480
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:08,005
l know. Must be a ghost.

481
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,645
Nonsense!

482
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:26,500
What's love that causes vows of
life and death.

483
01:00:27,036 --> 01:00:31,097
We fly in pairs everywhere,
braving hail or storm.

484
01:00:31,874 --> 01:00:33,239
Good verse.

485
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:36,571
Who filled in these for me?

486
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:40,745
Something fishy about this house.

487
01:00:48,191 --> 01:00:49,453
Shih Erh, what happened?

488
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,221
lt's haunted here.

489
01:00:53,930 --> 01:00:55,192
Haunted?

490
01:01:06,576 --> 01:01:09,136
Tsui, you painted beautifully.

491
01:01:10,446 --> 01:01:11,504
Thank you!

492
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:14,080
This must be your dream lover.

493
01:01:14,183 --> 01:01:16,048
Nonsense!

494
01:01:19,956 --> 01:01:21,924
She looks like the girl l know.

495
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:22,820
Why?

496
01:01:22,992 --> 01:01:24,755
She's poor and blank.

497
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:37,699
There's nothing dirty here.

498
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,000
l'm the dirtiest.

499
01:01:39,142 --> 01:01:40,507
l haven't taken a bath for days.

500
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:43,474
Go now. l must go to bed.

501
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,440
Good night.

502
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:47,914
Yell for me if anything happens,
except in nightmares.

503
01:01:48,084 --> 01:01:49,142
All right.

504
01:02:11,307 --> 01:02:13,468
l'm tired, l must go to bed.

505
01:02:37,166 --> 01:02:38,326
So it's you!

506
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,035
How did you come here?

507
01:02:45,608 --> 01:02:46,370
You...

508
01:02:46,442 --> 01:02:48,307
Don't be afraid!

509
01:02:48,745 --> 01:02:50,007
Keep away!

510
01:02:50,279 --> 01:02:51,644
l won't hurt you.

511
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:55,880
Hurt me? So you're a ghost.

512
01:02:56,052 --> 01:02:58,520
Right, l am a roving ghost.

513
01:02:59,288 --> 01:03:01,756
l jumped to my death down
the precipice.

514
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:05,952
l was on the way to my wedding.

515
01:03:06,229 --> 01:03:07,491
Someone forced you to die?

516
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:11,064
No, King Ghost kidnapped me.

517
01:03:12,034 --> 01:03:14,594
The wedding retinue all scattered.

518
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:18,670
l was left helplessly alone.

519
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:26,478
So l jumped over the Black Cliff.

520
01:03:27,016 --> 01:03:28,779
What a triumph for chastity!

521
01:03:29,952 --> 01:03:34,321
But they kept on after me.

522
01:03:34,791 --> 01:03:36,554
l have to hide in the picture.

523
01:03:38,227 --> 01:03:40,787
But why should it be me?

524
01:03:41,364 --> 01:03:44,333
l know you're nice to me.

525
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:47,665
My stay will get you in trouble.

526
01:03:48,438 --> 01:03:49,700
l'd better go!

527
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:54,842
You'd better stay here.

528
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:59,543
The two priests make me worried.

529
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:00,977
Could they be...

530
01:04:01,617 --> 01:04:03,676
She's my cousin from the countryside

531
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:04,944
Don't hurt her!

532
01:04:06,856 --> 01:04:09,825
Stop lying. She's a ghost.

533
01:04:09,992 --> 01:04:13,860
But she's a benign ghost.

534
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,590
No, she's a pitiable ghost.

535
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,800
Would you leave her alone?

536
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:19,025
Did l say l'm to arrest her?

537
01:04:19,368 --> 01:04:21,029
You're a very good man.

538
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:23,102
He's Shih Erh.

539
01:04:23,239 --> 01:04:24,206
She's...

540
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:26,105
Mo Chiu.

541
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:28,637
Beautiful name.

542
01:04:28,911 --> 01:04:32,210
Why? Are you in the mood for that?

543
01:04:32,315 --> 01:04:33,976
Master's coming back any moment.

544
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:42,580
l'd better go. He hates ghosts.

545
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:45,491
No, l won't allow that.

546
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:47,026
l'll hide you somehow.

547
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:48,697
Hide? Where to hide?

548
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:50,058
Even if you hide it,

549
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:51,996
- my master can find.
- Shih Erh!

550
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:54,202
All finished! Master's back.

551
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:56,162
Shih Erh!

552
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,907
Are you here?

553
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:04,577
Master.

554
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:06,508
What is the mischief now?

555
01:05:06,682 --> 01:05:08,445
The scholar's sick, needs tending.

556
01:05:08,885 --> 01:05:12,082
But you didn't nurse me!

557
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:14,587
He just slept.

558
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:18,193
Let's go back!

559
01:05:18,728 --> 01:05:19,990
ls he seriously sick?

560
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:22,393
Very sick. Head and stomach aches.

561
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:25,233
Though a book worm, he's a good man.

562
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:26,232
l better look him up.

563
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:27,366
Master!

564
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:36,872
Some fever. Prepare some medicine.

565
01:05:38,447 --> 01:05:40,415
Last night he painted,

566
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,617
and caught the draught.

567
01:05:43,219 --> 01:05:45,084
He's painted only a lotus
the whole night?

568
01:05:52,261 --> 01:05:53,626
No wonder he's sick.

569
01:05:54,263 --> 01:05:57,232
With the picture there,
he'll die soon.

570
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,161
Master,
the painting is his lifeblood.

571
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,563
Master, don't take it away.

572
01:06:01,704 --> 01:06:02,864
l'm doing this for him.

573
01:06:03,072 --> 01:06:04,334
But he's faking illness.

574
01:06:05,308 --> 01:06:06,468
No!

575
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:07,836
He does not have to.

576
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:09,111
Master.

577
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:14,650
l told you Master's trouble.

578
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:17,519
Now Mo Chiu has no place to live.

579
01:06:18,721 --> 01:06:20,086
Maybe it's in the books.

580
01:06:21,857 --> 01:06:23,518
You are all so nice to me.

581
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:27,792
l'm gratified even if...

582
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:30,225
l fail to reincarnate.

583
01:06:30,766 --> 01:06:33,428
Stop it. Or l'll cry.

584
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,098
l'll help you
to get the picture back.

585
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,708
Shih Erh, mind your master.

586
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,771
l won't let him find out.

587
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,876
1365. Should be enough.

588
01:06:57,994 --> 01:07:00,861
Steal the picture from Master.
Fly now.

589
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:02,562
Fly now!

590
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:08,461
l beg you. Fly.

591
01:07:09,138 --> 01:07:11,800
Be nice and do me a favor.

592
01:07:58,621 --> 01:07:59,781
What are you doing?

593
01:08:00,956 --> 01:08:02,321
Look, priest.

594
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,426
You talked about flair of life.

595
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:05,651
How about yourself?

596
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,290
l didn't want to do it.

597
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:10,127
But l must help them.

598
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,201
Then why splitting them up?

599
01:08:13,335 --> 01:08:15,496
Splitting them up? One's human,
the other's a ghost.

600
01:08:16,038 --> 01:08:18,404
She hasn't wronged you.
She deserves better.

601
01:08:18,507 --> 01:08:22,034
l'm helping her.
So that she could reincarnate.

602
01:08:22,478 --> 01:08:23,240
Reincarnate?

603
01:08:23,446 --> 01:08:25,414
He's out to split you up.

604
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:26,845
Splitting up?

605
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:34,354
Ghosts have no humanity.

606
01:08:34,590 --> 01:08:37,957
She sticks to you,

607
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:40,062
meaning to harm you.

608
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,299
l know. She's suffered enough.

609
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,568
And you, trying to harm her.

610
01:08:47,203 --> 01:08:48,568
lt's you who has no humanity.

611
01:08:49,138 --> 01:08:53,302
Humans and ghosts don't mix.

612
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:54,636
l won't mind your business any more.

613
01:08:56,879 --> 01:08:58,642
Master is eccentric.

614
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:00,511
But he was right.

615
01:09:16,365 --> 01:09:17,923
Priest, where's Mo Chiu?

616
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,863
Give her back to me. Or your life.

617
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:21,336
Master, you...

618
01:09:24,106 --> 01:09:25,368
You, too, don't have faith in me?

619
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:27,600
The alter is ruined.

620
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:28,970
Can't catch ghosts.

621
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:31,880
Don't try to fool me with masquerade

622
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:33,982
You still deny you caught Mo Chiu?

623
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:36,309
Master doesn't seen to be lying.

624
01:09:36,585 --> 01:09:37,847
Maybe she left by herself.

625
01:09:38,721 --> 01:09:39,881
She's gone!

626
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:45,218
She did it for my safety.

627
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:49,821
She could be caught by King Ghost.

628
01:09:50,833 --> 01:09:52,198
l must save her.

629
01:10:05,414 --> 01:10:06,676
Then, why standing here?

630
01:10:12,454 --> 01:10:14,319
Master, l know where he'd go.

631
01:10:14,456 --> 01:10:15,616
Say it!

632
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:19,451
Behave yourself.

633
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:30,428
Mo Chiu, where are you?

634
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:36,535
l'm looking for you.

635
01:10:37,613 --> 01:10:40,673
Mo Chiu, where are you?

636
01:10:48,023 --> 01:10:50,787
Mo Chiu.

637
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:54,224
So l've found you.

638
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:58,860
Mo Chiu.

639
01:11:11,513 --> 01:11:12,980
Why do you want to hurt me?

640
01:11:13,115 --> 01:11:16,107
Shut up. King Ghost hates
romantic types.

641
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:17,116
Get killed.

642
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:24,490
Demon,

643
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,719
you dare to attack a scholar.

644
01:11:26,996 --> 01:11:28,861
Shih Erh, she's the one you love.

645
01:11:44,613 --> 01:11:45,477
Help.

646
01:11:45,614 --> 01:11:46,774
Hold it.

647
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:12,635
So you finally know me.

648
01:12:15,144 --> 01:12:17,305
You have it on you all the time?

649
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:32,920
Master, she...

650
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:35,487
You must no be infatuated.

651
01:12:44,873 --> 01:12:46,340
Kill me, please.

652
01:12:50,579 --> 01:12:52,547
l'm painful under
King Ghost's control.

653
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:54,842
She's ghost. She'll hurt you.

654
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:05,887
Fate! Fate!

655
01:13:05,961 --> 01:13:08,020
You're the one fated to be bad.

656
01:13:08,564 --> 01:13:11,397
Scholar, you are meddlesome.

657
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:14,164
Priest, you forced him into it.

658
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:16,464
He did not dare teach you a lesson.

659
01:13:16,605 --> 01:13:17,469
You...

660
01:13:18,273 --> 01:13:21,640
Damned fool, you won't live long.

661
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:24,312
You curse me after
what l did for you.

662
01:13:31,653 --> 01:13:33,518
Shih Erh, go back with me.

663
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:41,758
You won't listen to me?

664
01:13:42,564 --> 01:13:45,226
l taught you for years.

665
01:13:49,905 --> 01:13:51,167
l had obeyed you too much.

666
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:53,934
Don't believe in people, keep aloof.

667
01:13:54,076 --> 01:13:55,941
People in turn treat me as dirt.

668
01:13:56,945 --> 01:13:58,606
l'm not different from a tree.

669
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:02,283
Kid, l understand your feeling.

670
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:04,850
They say love is stronger than metal

671
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:06,988
lt's a lie. Sword is stronger.

672
01:14:07,222 --> 01:14:08,689
The love game is not ours to play.

673
01:14:08,857 --> 01:14:10,119
lt'll hurt you.

674
01:14:10,325 --> 01:14:13,522
You're not loved,
so not qualified to judge.

675
01:14:15,064 --> 01:14:17,328
There is not life without love.

676
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:20,797
Love is like arm to leg.
A man with no love is a cripple.

677
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:24,336
A man without love is like
a dead body.

678
01:14:24,406 --> 01:14:25,771
The shit you know.

679
01:14:25,941 --> 01:14:26,805
Say no more!

680
01:14:26,975 --> 01:14:29,375
You're going to mention your age!

681
01:14:30,245 --> 01:14:32,406
l know man and ghost shouldn't love.

682
01:14:33,482 --> 01:14:35,848
But we loved, earnestly.

683
01:14:36,518 --> 01:14:40,181
Spark of the moment becomes
eternal love.

684
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,452
You tell me,

685
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:43,956
what have you done.

686
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:45,126
Or got?

687
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:45,988
l...

688
01:14:46,061 --> 01:14:47,323
l can answer it for you.

689
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:48,430
Nothing!

690
01:14:48,597 --> 01:14:49,757
Absolutely nothing!

691
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:52,565
Even the son is a pick up.

692
01:14:52,734 --> 01:14:54,702
Shih Erh.

693
01:14:57,806 --> 01:14:59,671
Mo Chiu, where are you?

694
01:15:02,177 --> 01:15:03,041
Mo Chiu!

695
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:08,107
l take it you won't reappear.

696
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:13,553
Regretfully, we're not for this life

697
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:19,788
Since you won't come out.

698
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:23,360
No point for me to stay.

699
01:15:26,301 --> 01:15:29,532
l won't be happy without you.

700
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:52,651
All's so unreal, like a dream.

701
01:15:53,662 --> 01:15:56,529
Mo Chiu.

702
01:15:58,233 --> 01:16:04,297
My soul and blossoms.

703
01:16:05,174 --> 01:16:13,548
Like a dream, beyond man's world.

704
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:18,215
One moment may be lifetime.

705
01:16:19,221 --> 01:16:25,182
You turned dust into fairy mountain.

706
01:16:26,828 --> 01:16:31,094
A deep imprint of kissing lips.

707
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:36,127
A gentle wiping of tears ofjoy.

708
01:16:36,672 --> 01:16:40,631
Toddy the dream has come true.

709
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:47,071
lt festers in your heart.

710
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:55,816
Let dream be locked in my love.

711
01:16:56,558 --> 01:17:00,824
Let all true love be poured out.

712
01:17:01,230 --> 01:17:08,193
And let there be eternity!

713
01:17:20,549 --> 01:17:22,414
Don't take us away.

714
01:17:23,452 --> 01:17:25,818
Shih Erh, help me.

715
01:17:33,695 --> 01:17:34,559
Master!

716
01:17:36,064 --> 01:17:38,532
They were snatched by King Ghost.

717
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,668
l knew it already.

718
01:17:40,836 --> 01:17:42,098
Let's go and rescue them.

719
01:17:42,337 --> 01:17:43,497
Come back.

720
01:17:47,476 --> 01:17:50,343
No use. They're destined to have
this crises.

721
01:17:50,512 --> 01:17:52,173
Why should we rescue them?

722
01:17:53,348 --> 01:17:56,112
Master, you're not doing anything?

723
01:18:00,222 --> 01:18:03,783
Love, love. lt's beyond me!

724
01:18:04,026 --> 01:18:05,994
But l know what it is.

725
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:10,222
Two sharing all perils,
not afraid to die.

726
01:18:10,365 --> 01:18:12,526
You're destined to
lifelong loneliness.

727
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:15,161
Stop it. You lecturing me?

728
01:18:15,337 --> 01:18:19,899
Right, you said man
and ghost are all bad.

729
01:18:20,175 --> 01:18:23,542
The two prove your wrong.

730
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:27,804
They are frustrated by
Heaven and ghosts.

731
01:18:28,283 --> 01:18:29,944
You too wanted to split them up.

732
01:18:30,085 --> 01:18:31,552
The world is so unfair.

733
01:18:31,753 --> 01:18:35,519
Right, there is no justice.

734
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:40,088
Man or ghost commits offences.

735
01:18:40,796 --> 01:18:42,855
There is no safe place all around.

736
01:18:44,132 --> 01:18:45,997
l'm helpless,

737
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:48,102
so l hid here.

738
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,438
But what's the meaning of a life?

739
01:18:50,772 --> 01:18:52,034
Live for centuries.

740
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,605
And you're like the tree.

741
01:18:53,809 --> 01:18:56,676
Right, can the tree take a bath,

742
01:18:56,845 --> 01:18:58,210
pick and bring you up?

743
01:18:58,413 --> 01:18:59,277
So what?

744
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:02,473
At heart you're selfish.

745
01:19:02,584 --> 01:19:03,846
- You traitor.
- You, old mule.

746
01:19:04,052 --> 01:19:05,110
Shut up your mouth.

747
01:19:06,188 --> 01:19:07,450
Fool.

748
01:19:07,756 --> 01:19:10,020
Going there is inviting death.

749
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:13,523
l had rather killed you now.

750
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:15,425
As though l hadn't picked you up.

751
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,428
Go and get killed.

752
01:20:17,859 --> 01:20:20,327
Love, what the hell is love?

753
01:20:20,462 --> 01:20:24,523
What darn thing goes by
the name of Love?

754
01:20:25,233 --> 01:20:29,499
What God-forsaken thing is Love?

755
01:20:36,178 --> 01:20:38,942
Love can be pure, soft,
even many splendored.

756
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,947
Love can be a tryst, an affair,
even a commitment.

757
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:44,950
Solitude is no big deal
if there is love.

758
01:20:45,086 --> 01:20:47,850
l care, laugh or cry because of love.

759
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:51,392
Tell me what then is this thing love.

760
01:20:54,463 --> 01:20:59,423
Heaven, in Love, ages.
But love lives.

761
01:21:00,202 --> 01:21:02,762
You can't see clearly, can't wake up

762
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:06,007
l'm a bigot, a nut because l love.

763
01:21:06,174 --> 01:21:09,371
Now what the Hell is this Love?

764
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:15,548
Love... keeps the knight on his horse

765
01:21:16,351 --> 01:21:17,511
Love.

766
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:27,853
Why should you persecute us?

767
01:21:28,129 --> 01:21:31,690
Simple! Nobody is to get,

768
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:34,166
what l couldn't get.

769
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:36,065
You're selfish!

770
01:21:36,571 --> 01:21:40,234
Snatching brides
because you're not loved.

771
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:44,436
You've broken up many matches.

772
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,244
To us, there's very unfair.

773
01:21:48,617 --> 01:21:50,778
Heaven hasn't been fair to me either

774
01:21:51,052 --> 01:21:55,546
Calamity hit before l married.

775
01:21:56,758 --> 01:21:59,522
l have never had a moment of warmth.

776
01:22:00,529 --> 01:22:02,190
Least to say, love!

777
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:09,133
l thus have no worry, no pain.

778
01:22:10,272 --> 01:22:13,435
l'm set to wipe out
all love and care.

779
01:22:14,476 --> 01:22:17,445
So everyone is feeling less like me.

780
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:21,076
You're wrong.
Love doesn't have to be painful.

781
01:22:21,550 --> 01:22:23,211
Only you haven't met it!

782
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:27,947
Just like me and him, two worlds.

783
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:31,056
But our love transcends everything.

784
01:22:31,493 --> 01:22:32,960
That's bliss.

785
01:22:33,128 --> 01:22:34,891
We're inseparable.

786
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:40,163
He won't sacrifice himself for you!

787
01:22:40,802 --> 01:22:44,238
And l don't believe in true love.

788
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:47,899
Suppose there is. lt won't last.

789
01:22:48,009 --> 01:22:53,276
Mo Chiu...!

790
01:22:55,016 --> 01:22:55,778
Get away fast!

791
01:22:55,951 --> 01:22:57,418
Don't hurt her.

792
01:22:57,652 --> 01:22:58,914
Kill me instead.

793
01:22:59,154 --> 01:23:01,622
You sacrificing yourself for me!

794
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:06,460
Thank Heaven for
this moment of truth.

795
01:23:06,628 --> 01:23:10,587
Hold me, tight!

796
01:23:11,433 --> 01:23:12,491
Mo Chiu!

797
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,438
Are you alright, Mo Chiu?

798
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:25,513
Yes.

799
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,442
Why did you hurt Mo Chiu?

800
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:28,148
That was King Ghost.

801
01:23:30,418 --> 01:23:31,783
Too late. Run!

802
01:23:31,987 --> 01:23:33,454
- Mo Chiu, come on.
- Come on.

803
01:23:37,258 --> 01:23:39,419
You can't get away.

804
01:24:17,365 --> 01:24:19,128
Mo Chiu, come here.

805
01:24:21,202 --> 01:24:23,067
- Mo Chiu!
- You mustn't go.

806
01:24:23,204 --> 01:24:24,967
l want to save Mo Chiu!

807
01:24:26,675 --> 01:24:27,642
Don't.

808
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:51,659
Find the master.

809
01:26:12,914 --> 01:26:14,472
lt's me. Let's go.

810
01:27:01,729 --> 01:27:02,787
Master!

811
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:06,233
Look out for traps. Go!

812
01:27:26,988 --> 01:27:28,455
You can't get away.

813
01:27:49,310 --> 01:27:53,474
You're interfering and wicked.

814
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:55,276
So what?

815
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,485
Shih Erh, the sword.

816
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:03,552
Sword's back in sheath.

817
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,848
The gate to Hell is closing.

818
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:29,209
Poor scholar.

819
01:28:29,617 --> 01:28:31,084
Mo Chiu!

820
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:33,480
- Go now, get out of here now.
- Where is Mo Chiu?

821
01:28:34,155 --> 01:28:35,122
Hurry up.

822
01:28:36,457 --> 01:28:37,515
Get going!

823
01:28:37,992 --> 01:28:39,357
Mo Chiu!

824
01:28:40,762 --> 01:28:43,663
- Take him.
- Mo Chiu!

825
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:45,289
You must leave this place.

826
01:28:45,466 --> 01:28:46,228
l won't!

827
01:28:46,434 --> 01:28:47,901
lnto the picture, l'll lead you.

828
01:28:48,102 --> 01:28:48,966
Get going.

829
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:52,470
We are bound to be separated.

830
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:53,641
You'd better go now.

831
01:28:53,841 --> 01:28:54,808
Mo Chiu!

832
01:28:55,777 --> 01:28:56,937
Help us.

833
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:58,103
Let me be with Mo Chiu.

834
01:28:58,313 --> 01:29:02,875
Mo Chiu! Too late. Run.

835
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:05,019
l must stick to Mo Chiu.

836
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:07,087
Walk into the painting, Mo Chiu.

837
01:29:07,956 --> 01:29:08,820
Mo Chiu!

838
01:29:10,558 --> 01:29:12,219
Hold it and climb in.

839
01:29:13,227 --> 01:29:14,194
Mo Chiu!

840
01:29:20,034 --> 01:29:21,899
- Mo Chiu.
- Don't.

841
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:26,436
Hung Chien, don't...

842
01:29:29,544 --> 01:29:35,107
Mo Chiu.

843
01:29:37,151 --> 01:29:39,016
Grasp it fast.

844
01:29:40,221 --> 01:29:41,085
Come.

845
01:29:42,991 --> 01:29:44,549
Too late. Run.

846
01:29:50,031 --> 01:29:53,489
l'll be with you all my life.

847
01:29:55,937 --> 01:30:01,000
Tsui Hung-chien, grasp it tight.

848
01:30:01,776 --> 01:30:02,834
No time.

849
01:30:11,919 --> 01:30:17,482
Tsui Hung Chien.

850
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:36,743
Master, aren't they foolish?

851
01:30:37,779 --> 01:30:41,180
You're the fool.

852
01:30:44,552 --> 01:30:46,315
Do what you like to do.

853
01:30:49,123 --> 01:30:52,490
l'll come to get you, priest.

854
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,819
Take good care!
