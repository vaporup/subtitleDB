00:00:00,866 --> 00:00:02,128
Room 1954

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,463
- Certainly, sir
- Thank you

3
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:06,901
Who Am I, Christine,
South African Tribune. Remember me?

4
00:00:06,972 --> 00:00:08,769
Here, take one of my cards

5
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,408
I finally found you!

6
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,774
It's amazing
how hard it is to track you down

7
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,539
My editor's been asking...

8
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:15,136
Excuse me. Could you do me a favor?

9
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:18,112
My taxi's waiting outside.
Can you pay for it?

10
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,876
Then the interview. Okay?

11
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:23,144
OK, no problem. But remember the deal

12
00:00:23,222 --> 00:00:27,420
The interview as soon as I get back.
I trust you

13
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:30,753
Check her out

14
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,868
Thank you

15
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,437
Police, step aside, please

16
00:00:41,507 --> 00:00:43,737
Police? I didn't even see your I.D.!

17
00:01:00,793 --> 00:01:02,317
1954

18
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,161
He's gone that way!

19
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,038
What did you give him?

20
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,809
My card. I told you I'm a reporter

21
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,441
I'm doing a story on him

22
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,983
Sure. Story. Right

23
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:12,114
Come in, come in

24
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:16,153
What's going on?

25
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,391
What?

26
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:51,759
Go! Go! Go!

27
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,827
Stop!

28
00:03:56,969 --> 00:03:58,027
Start the car!

29
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:59,229
How?

30
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,368
I'll shift the gears!

31
00:04:04,443 --> 00:04:05,501
What?

32
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:06,908
What's going on?

33
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,904
Come in!

34
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:11,072
Wait! Are you crazy?

35
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,879
Slow down, come on! I'm not in yet!

36
00:04:16,755 --> 00:04:18,689
Come on, move it, get on!

37
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,358
Third, fourth gear

38
00:04:25,964 --> 00:04:27,056
Which gear you run?

39
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:27,791
I don't know

40
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:29,094
Look out!

41
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:39,236
Watch out!

42
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,337
Be careful!

43
00:05:20,018 --> 00:05:21,781
You stop messing the gear!

44
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:22,946
Find a better road!

45
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,383
Let me

46
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:25,514
Go! Go! Go!

47
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,070
Oh, no! We can't move!

48
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,071
Do you know how to drive?

49
00:05:50,148 --> 00:05:52,514
What do you expect? I only have one arm

50
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:54,818
Move, I drive

51
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,754
We're stuck!

52
00:05:57,055 --> 00:05:59,046
Don't worry, I can figure out

53
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,618
Do something. They're right behind!

54
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:38,588
Back to the car

55
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,608
Car 54, in pursuit

56
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,219
Hey! Watch out!

57
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,482
I'm driving

58
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,251
The police! We're saved!

59
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:09,157
Good!

60
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,885
No! Even the police are after me!

61
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,191
Why? What have you done?

62
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,162
Just keep going!

63
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:24,839
You're great!

64
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,104
Piece of cake

65
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,043
They're back there!

66
00:07:39,858 --> 00:07:41,553
It's a dead end!

67
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:44,893
Not again!

68
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:46,555
What was that?

69
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:49,530
Nothing, just sit tight!

70
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,946
Next time warn us about seat belts!

71
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:06,814
Sorry!

72
00:08:06,885 --> 00:08:08,512
Sorry? Christine, are you okay?

73
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:13,421
I'm all right, but they're
right behind us! Get us out of here!

74
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:14,789
Push me up

75
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,093
Let me show you what I'v got

76
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:30,373
They're behind us!

77
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,812
Come on, let's go, that way!

78
00:09:21,326 --> 00:09:23,385
We're gonna go over! Lean to the right!

79
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:24,087
We gotta help them!

80
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,129
OK

81
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:30,826
Come out! Hurry up!

82
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,166
Thank you

83
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,070
Don't thank him! Grab him!

84
00:09:52,824 --> 00:09:53,722
Sorry

85
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,127
You've gotta trust me

86
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,325
Will this work?

87
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:04,032
Yes. Good!

88
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,161
So why are those guys after you?

89
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,569
Everybody's after me

90
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:10,764
C.I.A., Secret Police, even you

91
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,469
You must be hiding something

92
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,008
Hiding what?

93
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,839
You must have stolen
something from them.

94
00:10:15,914 --> 00:10:17,279
Where is it?

95
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,475
Where is what?

96
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,313
I don't know! Try to remember

97
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:21,977
How did you do that so quick?

98
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,555
All I remember is I've got 6 passports

99
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:29,992
6 passports? No fingerprints? Amazing!

100
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:32,427
But this is not you. Who is this?

101
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:33,759
I got it from the dead body

102
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,096
Dead body? What a great story! Christine

103
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,567
It's not a story!

104
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,260
Eleven done one too many.

105
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:40,870
What does this mean?

106
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,834
- It's a puzzle.
- Eleven done one too many

107
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:44,500
You remember something, don't you?

108
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:45,372
Tell me!

109
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:46,967
I used to be good at that

110
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,578
Someone bring my memory back

111
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:54,944
What are you doing?

112
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,485
I'm trying to help him!

113
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,648
Don't you remember?
The doctor said it would help

114
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:00,247
I told you! Never do that again!

115
00:11:00,325 --> 00:11:01,485
OK

116
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:15,237
Who am I?

117
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:49,205
We ran into a slight snag. We lost him

118
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,037
I suggest you find him. Quickly!

119
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,409
He's lost his memory.
What harm can he do us?

120
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:57,045
You ever heard of short term amnesia,
you idiot?

121
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:57,979
What do you want me to do?

122
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,142
What you were supposed to do
in the first place. Kill him!

123
00:12:00,218 --> 00:12:01,412
Right

124
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,451
Africa's a bit bigger than Washington

125
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:09,292
Are you sure you want a piece?
Very juicy

126
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,356
Guys! I've broken the code!

127
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:14,031
It's a phone number.
A company in Rotterdam!

128
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:15,066
Rotterdam?

129
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:15,827
Yeah!

130
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,696
How do you know?

131
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,463
Eleven done one too many

132
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,333
The letters stand for
numbers on a phone key pad

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,098
The first number
is the international code, zero eleven

134
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,802
then the country and city codes.
Don't you see?

135
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,871
Done is d-one, right?
So look, d is three and one is one

136
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,473
31, the Netherlands!

137
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,448
Okay

138
00:12:33,518 --> 00:12:34,951
The company's name is Heinex Holdings

139
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,352
But all I got
was their answering machine

140
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,549
Sounds great! But I still don't get it

141
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,455
Where did you learn
to break codes like that?

142
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:43,719
Spy novels. I'm addicted to them

143
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:46,056
They could know my past.

144
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:46,961
I have to go there

145
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,000
You mean we have to go there?

146
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,591
You promised me a story, remember?

147
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,896
Besides,
the newspaper will pay our expenses

148
00:12:52,971 --> 00:12:55,599
Okay. But you go at your own risk

149
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,604
It sounds so exciting.
I wish I could come with you

150
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,911
Hey, let's take a picture
for my African scrapbook

151
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:03,407
No!

152
00:13:05,717 --> 00:13:06,911
What's wrong?

153
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,114
Something wrong?

154
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,615
I tried to scare him, just like you did

155
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,192
That was a good one!

156
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:19,195
I got you

157
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:20,322
Did it work?

158
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:22,757
Anyway, this one's out of film.
Let's try the other one

159
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:27,168
Forget it. Yuki, thank you very much.
We'll keep in touch

160
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,130
Say goodbye to your brother

161
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:30,401
Let's go

162
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,935
Where are you headed?

163
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,306
Airport

164
00:13:33,378 --> 00:13:35,039
You're going to walk?

165
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,272
I'll drive!

166
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,049
Good idea

167
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:42,244
What's wrong with my driving?

168
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,279
"Rotterdam, Holland"

169
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,451
This is the place

170
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:18,919
The encoded phone number belongs to
that building over there

171
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,088
Did you talk to anybody?

172
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:21,318
- Yes
- Who?

173
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,189
The operator

174
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,249
Then what?

175
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:24,158
I just hung up

176
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:25,059
You hung up?

177
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,859
Who am I supposed to talk to? There must
be over a hundred companies in there

178
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:36,469
The number is right

179
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,738
The matches from the dead body
are also from this restaurant

180
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,743
He must have been here

181
00:14:41,813 --> 00:14:44,441
That's obvious. So what do we do now?

182
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,543
Shall we just walk in and take a look?

183
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,815
I don't think so.
The place is heavily guarded

184
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,483
Even the police would have a hard time
getting in there

185
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,224
Where are you going?

186
00:15:00,598 --> 00:15:02,088
I've got to make a phone call

187
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,600
Here. Use mine

188
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,230
No. I'll use the pay phone.
Reception's better

189
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:18,041
Mr. Morgan

190
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:19,140
Hello? Who's that?

191
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:21,478
It's Who Am I. Remember me?

192
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,984
Yes, of course. How could I forget?

193
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,921
I found out something very important

194
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:28,219
Yeah? What's that?

195
00:15:29,594 --> 00:15:31,528
Are you there?

196
00:15:33,097 --> 00:15:35,531
A building. Maybe their headquarters

197
00:15:36,701 --> 00:15:37,565
Whose headquarters?

198
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:38,966
The people trying to kill me

199
00:15:39,137 --> 00:15:41,401
I'm at the coffee shop across the street

200
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:44,436
And whereabouts in South Africa
is this building?

201
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,602
No. I'm in Rotterdam!

202
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:48,870
He's across the road

203
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,107
What?

204
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,756
Hello? Are you there?

205
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:01,653
Yeah. I'm here

206
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:02,724
OK, don't do anything

207
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:05,058
Give me 30 minutes to arrange
back up for you, then call me

208
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,426
I need more information

209
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,465
OK

210
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:10,600
And remember, don't trust anyone.
Got it?

211
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:13,364
Hey, are you listening?

212
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:14,336
Yes

213
00:16:21,846 --> 00:16:22,904
What's going on?

214
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,846
Our native friend's in the coffee shop
across the street

215
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:26,406
Take your men and finish him off

216
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:27,178
Who?

217
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,549
Our African friend

218
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,245
What do you mean? The coffee sho...

219
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,117
And don't blow it this time

220
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:32,653
OK! Go!

221
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:34,918
Peter, wait!

222
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,291
Don't kill him! Bring him back here

223
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:38,590
Yes, sir

224
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,325
I need to find out what he knows

225
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,722
Yeah, I'm here. Okay, don't do anything

226
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,428
Give me 30 minutes to arrange
back up for you, then call me

227
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:19,993
I need more information

228
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:22,196
And remember. Don't trust anyone

229
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,376
Listen to me!

230
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,851
Why are you tapping my phone calls?

231
00:17:40,925 --> 00:17:42,324
I'm a reporter, remember?

232
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:43,621
What kind of reporter uses this?

233
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,357
The best!
I'll do anything to get the story!

234
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:48,825
Anything?

235
00:17:49,267 --> 00:17:53,294
Yes. Anything

236
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:13,753
Quick!

237
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,702
Look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
done that. I crossed the line

238
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,599
But I'm not the one
you should be worrying about

239
00:18:29,674 --> 00:18:31,699
Maybe your friend on the phone
is lying to you

240
00:18:31,776 --> 00:18:33,710
No. He's C.I.A.

241
00:18:34,412 --> 00:18:37,347
Every organization
has people on the take

242
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,751
Look, I didn't mean to offend you

243
00:18:49,827 --> 00:18:51,886
Here. You can have the tape

244
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:08,374
Let me explain!

245
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:11,609
This is a gun! You're not a reporter!

246
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,776
Now I know
how you broke the code so easily

247
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:15,250
And opened the handcuffs!

248
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:17,184
Who are you? What do you want?

249
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,586
Listen to me!

250
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:19,816
Who are you?

251
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:20,858
All right

252
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,691
I haven't been totally honest with you,
but it was for your own protection

253
00:19:25,329 --> 00:19:27,092
I'm with the C.I.A.

254
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,429
Now you're C.I.A.

255
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,129
Yes, but I'm on your side!

256
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:34,837
Nobody's on my side!

257
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:44,804
You call anybody in the bathroom?
Who were you calling?

258
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,543
What are you talking about?

259
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:48,283
You set me up!

260
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:05,530
You, round the back!

261
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,769
I've got him! Come here to help!

262
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:05,853
Think you can get away?

263
00:21:31,455 --> 00:21:32,615
Excuse me

264
00:21:55,546 --> 00:21:57,673
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

265
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,277
What's going on here?

266
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,142
Mind your own business!

267
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:03,612
Hey, you can't do that!

268
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,544
Feels good?

269
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,889
Get him!

270
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,380
Stop! Don't move!

271
00:23:57,001 --> 00:23:57,990
Don't shoot!

272
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,222
Here, Sweetie

273
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,890
Donation, Save The Children Fund

274
00:25:03,534 --> 00:25:04,865
Mr. Morgan?

275
00:25:05,336 --> 00:25:06,234
Who Am I?

276
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,294
You're right. Someone's after me

277
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,301
My men couldn't find you
at the coffee shop

278
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:12,706
What happened?

279
00:25:13,477 --> 00:25:14,967
I had to leave. Where are you?

280
00:25:15,046 --> 00:25:16,604
I'm on my way to Rotterdam

281
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,614
You stay put. Where are you?

282
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,274
How long till you get here?

283
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:23,286
3 to 4 hours.
I'll commandeer a military jet

284
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:26,283
Where are you?

285
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:29,125
I'll call you then

286
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:33,986
So why don't we just kill him?

287
00:25:34,231 --> 00:25:37,098
Because we still don't know
what he's found out

288
00:25:37,168 --> 00:25:38,795
The buyer's coming this afternoon

289
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:42,396
When the transaction's complete,
we'll have nothing to fear from him

290
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:46,605
You take care of
the three Einsteins upstairs

291
00:25:46,677 --> 00:25:49,202
When the deal's history, so are they

292
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,280
I want that lab pristine

293
00:25:51,348 --> 00:25:53,248
And no evidence left in the building

294
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:54,375
It's being dealt with

295
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,587
Hey, Mr. Armano

296
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:39,752
Hey, nice joint you got here

297
00:27:39,823 --> 00:27:41,552
I'm getting to like Rotterdam

298
00:27:42,092 --> 00:27:44,890
I see the General's got security
nice and tight

299
00:27:45,095 --> 00:27:46,653
Yeah. And he's been expecting you

300
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:15,119
Oh, sorry!

301
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,775
Over here. This entry point. And here

302
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:41,750
I want 24 hours surveillance.
Effective immediately

303
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:42,945
Yes, madam

304
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:56,256
What are you doing?

305
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:29,057
So that happened to the power station

306
00:29:29,133 --> 00:29:31,897
That rock is really something

307
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,307
Now that's what
I call quality advertising

308
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:42,368
Can you imagine the amount of energy
produced by these fragments?

309
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:45,142
My client prefers reality to imagination

310
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,682
That's why we're not giving you
all the money up front

311
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,114
But I would say that half a billion
dollars is more than enough motivation

312
00:29:51,188 --> 00:29:53,383
for you to deliver a quality product

313
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,153
Mr. Nelson is not giving charity

314
00:29:56,226 --> 00:29:58,057
Believe me, he's getting a bargain

315
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:01,291
He's only paid one third of the cost
of the research project in South Africa

316
00:30:01,365 --> 00:30:03,629
and he's getting a complete product

317
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,465
They're bringing the scientists
and the merchandise right up

318
00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:10,439
Bring in another pot of hot coffee

319
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,601
So you take 20% on the deal, Armano?

320
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:44,664
Frank, I'm just a poor boy
trying to make a living

321
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:51,708
This disc contains the only
remaining information about the formula

322
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:55,280
The rest of the research files
have been completely deleted

323
00:30:55,586 --> 00:30:57,850
And keep in mind that
we still do not have all the knowledge

324
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:01,652
to control the energy
expansion completely

325
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:02,987
Yes, sir. That's a problem

326
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,392
We need more time to solve this problem

327
00:31:05,462 --> 00:31:06,190
Once we solve it

328
00:31:06,263 --> 00:31:09,562
the energy could be used for
a positive purpose

329
00:31:09,633 --> 00:31:10,497
He's right

330
00:31:10,567 --> 00:31:12,125
That's very considerate, gentlemen

331
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:15,399
but we had something
a little bit different in mind

332
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,940
Can you imagine, an ordinary machine gun

333
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:21,000
with the destructive force
of a ballistic missile?

334
00:31:22,146 --> 00:31:27,448
You promise us that you should not
use the formula for destruction

335
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:28,815
We've already spoken about
your daughter, Manfred!

336
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:29,910
Wait a minute!

337
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,922
And now, you sell it to arms dealers.
Yes. That's it!

338
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,821
Take these gentlemen away

339
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:37,218
Seems they've overexerted themselves

340
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:41,022
This Mr. Nelson of yours
is not only a very astute man

341
00:31:41,098 --> 00:31:42,565
but he's also going to be very rich

342
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,727
because everybody's going top
want this weaponry

343
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:51,372
Can you believe this little piece
of plastic costs billions of dollars?

344
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:01,316
Champagne is ready outside, sir

345
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:05,477
Why don't you take our friend here
with you and show him our hospitality

346
00:32:07,357 --> 00:32:09,291
Yes, sir

347
00:32:14,364 --> 00:32:17,162
It's so hard to find a good help
you can trust these days

348
00:32:17,234 --> 00:32:18,292
Yes

349
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:28,836
Six, seven, eight zeros

350
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:32,075
Don't make a mistake. One zero makes
a hell of a lot of difference

351
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,982
I don't play around
when it comes to money

352
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:40,253
You know when I press this enter,
all that money's going to be yours

353
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,086
Let me

354
00:32:43,093 --> 00:32:45,118
"Your request is being processed.
Please wait."

355
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,296
Look at this.
They call this swift banking

356
00:32:55,372 --> 00:32:56,771
and I still got to wait

357
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,000
Come on!

358
00:32:58,075 --> 00:32:59,167
Calm down!

359
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:01,507
You waited this long,
what's a few minutes?

360
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:02,974
I need a drink

361
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:09,043
I'm the one
who should be worried about this

362
00:33:11,221 --> 00:33:12,210
General

363
00:33:12,823 --> 00:33:15,792
I still think there's too many people
that know about this

364
00:33:15,993 --> 00:33:17,255
What do you think?

365
00:33:17,327 --> 00:33:18,351
Relax!

366
00:33:18,428 --> 00:33:21,864
The commandos involved in the mission
all met with a tragic accident

367
00:33:21,932 --> 00:33:25,766
Oh yeah? Well according to my sources,
there was one survivor

368
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:28,637
He doesn't even know who he is

369
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:30,969
And by tomorrow, he won't exist

370
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:35,803
And our three learned gentlemen
will be disposed of along with their lab

371
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,547
Well, why wait? We got the disc.
Why not do it right now?

372
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:48,285
Yung, take care of the three gentlemen

373
00:33:48,358 --> 00:33:49,586
Yes, sir

374
00:33:51,094 --> 00:33:53,528
Your statement worries me a little

375
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,462
What? Am I going to be the next to go?

376
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:59,334
That's right. You did send me the five
hundred million dollars, didn't you?

377
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:05,264
I'm joking. I was kidding.
We're friends, Armano

378
00:34:06,877 --> 00:34:08,538
Now look! Friendship!

379
00:34:09,913 --> 00:34:11,175
Friendship!

380
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:16,210
"Save The Children Fund"

381
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:30,633
Coffee?

382
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:31,895
Yes, coffee

383
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,960
Coffee, coffee

384
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:45,908
How's it going?

385
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:49,877
We have a dress code. Tidy up

386
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:56,958
Congratulations, General

387
00:34:57,027 --> 00:34:58,551
All in good time

388
00:34:59,396 --> 00:35:00,954
"Transaction aborted."

389
00:35:01,031 --> 00:35:03,056
What's the matter? Not enough zeros?

390
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:07,100
That's funny. It's not on my screen

391
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,363
What are you talking about?
I just fonNarded it from our account

392
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,839
Here, take a look

393
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:16,443
The name of my account
is Heinex Holdings

394
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:17,480
So what?

395
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:19,412
It's not in Heinex Holdings

396
00:35:19,483 --> 00:35:22,816
It's in Save The Children Fund!

397
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:31,091
"Donation received. Thank you very much."

398
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:37,463
No!

399
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,229
Somebody's been messing
with my computer!

400
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,929
Someone sneaked in!
Knocked out one of our guys!

401
00:35:41,004 --> 00:35:43,598
It's him! Seal off the building!
Floor to floor search!

402
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,105
Find him! Kill him!

403
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:46,073
He's in the building!

404
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:46,973
Who's in the building?

405
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,103
What? He's in the building?

406
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,238
That's it! This is a set up

407
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,305
You guys are trying to set me up,
aren't you?

408
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:54,645
Yes, sir

409
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:55,878
That's the man! Right there!
That's the man!

410
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:57,419
When you were pouring the coffee

411
00:35:57,487 --> 00:35:59,512
you were messing with my computer,
weren't you?

412
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:00,487
No! It was your own man!

413
00:36:00,557 --> 00:36:01,421
My man?

414
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:02,685
Shut up! Where is he?

415
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:04,090
Just outside!

416
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,097
Go down. Search the kitchen!

417
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:17,871
Dont worry

418
00:36:17,941 --> 00:36:19,101
Don't worry

419
00:36:19,176 --> 00:36:20,575
I'll find him

420
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:24,080
The scientists! We can't kill them now!
Stop them!

421
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:27,713
Save the children. I hate children

422
00:36:27,784 --> 00:36:31,049
I want this building secure from top to
bottom. Seal off all the escape routes

423
00:36:31,121 --> 00:36:32,986
And check the ventilation system

424
00:36:33,056 --> 00:36:33,715
Groups of three

425
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,222
Stay alert. He's a special operative

426
00:36:36,293 --> 00:36:38,591
A million dollars to the team
that kills him

427
00:36:38,662 --> 00:36:39,629
Now get going

428
00:36:39,696 --> 00:36:41,095
Yes, sir

429
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,325
I'm depending on you two

430
00:36:44,401 --> 00:36:45,663
Yes, sir

431
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:50,668
Right. Before this goes any further,
I want my disc back

432
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,205
Are you still trying to
pull something on me?

433
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,903
You think I'm some little punk,
you can just push around?

434
00:36:54,978 --> 00:36:57,538
What's the matter?
Are you getting senile before your time?

435
00:36:57,614 --> 00:36:59,013
Don't you remember? I gave you the disc.

436
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:00,572
Like this

437
00:37:00,951 --> 00:37:01,940
You gave me the disc?

438
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:04,178
Well, I gave you the disc back.
Just like this

439
00:37:04,254 --> 00:37:05,516
You have it on you. Don't you?

440
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,648
Get your greasy hands off me!

441
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,856
That's the guy
who was pouring me coffee!

442
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:15,989
It's him!

443
00:37:16,066 --> 00:37:16,896
Him who?

444
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:18,400
Get out of my way!

445
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,103
Get the men here!

446
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:31,510
You missed! What an idiot!

447
00:37:33,416 --> 00:37:37,113
And you shortstuff. You got my disc!

448
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:38,786
Is this what you want?

449
00:37:39,923 --> 00:37:44,223
You got a fraction of a second to give
that disc back to it's rightful owner

450
00:37:44,294 --> 00:37:45,488
or I'm going to break your little...

451
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:47,621
Don't talk! Kill him!

452
00:37:48,298 --> 00:37:50,323
You shut up! I got it under control

453
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,664
What's the matter with your mind?

454
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,932
Because of this?

455
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:03,745
You stole and kidnapped,
and killed nine good men! All for this?

456
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,780
Why do you want to destroy life?

457
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:09,946
When you can make it better?

458
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,009
What do you want?

459
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,416
Nothing

460
00:38:13,323 --> 00:38:14,813
I want my life back!

461
00:38:16,026 --> 00:38:17,789
He's over here!

462
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:20,159
Get the disc and kill him!

463
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,758
The children thank you

464
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:28,899
General, are you okay?

465
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:30,371
Call an ambulance!

466
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,429
Get that disc!

467
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:33,040
Come on. Yes, sir

468
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,516
He's down there!

469
00:39:14,718 --> 00:39:15,776
Don't move!

470
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,577
Who Am I?

471
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,051
Morgan! It's you!

472
00:39:19,122 --> 00:39:20,885
Of course, it's me!
I've been trying to find you!

473
00:39:20,957 --> 00:39:22,288
You've come to kill me!
You're one of them!

474
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,520
What are you talking about?
I've come to get you out

475
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:26,685
You're lying. What are you doing here?

476
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,524
I'm working undercover

477
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:30,930
It's taken me two years to get into
Sharman's organization

478
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:32,969
I'm this close to nailing him!

479
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,871
Yeah. I guess you saw me
in the conference room

480
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,337
Once the money goes through, he's mine

481
00:39:39,876 --> 00:39:41,503
I sent the money to the children's fund

482
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:42,738
You what?

483
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,871
You know what you've done?

484
00:39:46,082 --> 00:39:48,949
You've blown a two year investigation!

485
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:52,783
The disc!
You must have had access to the disc

486
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,723
Have you got it?

487
00:39:55,258 --> 00:39:56,418
Yes

488
00:39:56,793 --> 00:39:59,591
Good. It's crucial evidence.

489
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,096
You keep it

490
00:40:01,431 --> 00:40:03,899
Now, let's get you out of here

491
00:40:04,401 --> 00:40:08,132
Wait a minute.
Your men found me at the coffee shop

492
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:09,795
I never told you where I was

493
00:40:09,873 --> 00:40:12,603
Of course they found you.
Remember the calling card I gave you?

494
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:14,007
It's got a microchip in it

495
00:40:14,077 --> 00:40:16,102
It gives your location
every time you use it

496
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:17,075
They tried to kill me!

497
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,307
They weren't my men

498
00:40:18,481 --> 00:40:20,745
By the time my men got there,
you were gone

499
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,349
Sharman must be tapping my phone!

500
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,648
Look, if I'd wanted to kill you

501
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:26,655
I could have done that in South Africa

502
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:37,091
Sharman must have sent the hit men
after you in Johannesburg

503
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:39,795
But don't worry, we'll take care of them

504
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:49,971
Look, I know you're confused

505
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,772
You don't know who to trust

506
00:40:52,148 --> 00:40:55,447
Like I said before, don't trust anyone

507
00:41:00,623 --> 00:41:03,114
You've got the disc. You keep it

508
00:41:03,326 --> 00:41:05,590
Now, let's get you out of here

509
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:18,163
I might not get out. You keep it

510
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:24,977
Let's go

511
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,066
You'll never know who you are

512
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:06,921
I might have an amnesia.
But I'm not stupid!

513
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,636
Don't trust anyone! Remember?

514
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:33,281
Get your hands off me! Go get him!

515
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,919
The disc!

516
00:42:36,986 --> 00:42:38,385
He's got the disc!

517
00:43:09,919 --> 00:43:11,409
You've got two choices

518
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:13,956
Give us the disc, and jump off

519
00:43:14,023 --> 00:43:16,082
Or no. 2, we take the disc

520
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:17,524
and throw you off

521
00:43:17,927 --> 00:43:19,326
I like the third choice

522
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:22,623
I keep the disc
and I throw you both off!

523
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,225
Good!

524
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:29,770
How long?

525
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:31,170
30 seconds

526
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:27,062
29 seconds. Not bad!

527
00:44:35,004 --> 00:44:36,028
Go and again

528
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:49,576
Behind you!

529
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:22,407
Take it easy, we've got plenty of time

530
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:23,775
20 seconds

531
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,572
Come on

532
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:41,647
Come on

533
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,321
Time's up!

534
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:46,521
Shut up!

535
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,912
Good!

536
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:14,354
Game's over!

537
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:15,721
Let's finish him!

538
00:50:03,933 --> 00:50:05,662
What are you fighting for?
Where is the disc?

539
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,927
It fell at the carpark!

540
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,896
Finish up, quickly!

541
00:50:14,877 --> 00:50:17,277
The black bag in the carpark,
pick it up

542
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,459
You want more fight?

543
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,339
Don't hit me!

544
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,627
He's up there!

545
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:30,704
Which side he's going off?

546
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:31,865
I don't know

547
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:33,968
You bunch of burns!

548
00:53:51,627 --> 00:53:53,891
I can't believe
you're still in one piece!

549
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:57,528
You've got no choice, come on

550
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:04,237
They gotta be kidding!

551
00:54:07,676 --> 00:54:09,041
We won't catch him in this!

552
00:54:09,111 --> 00:54:10,373
It's under control

553
00:54:10,546 --> 00:54:12,036
Execute Plan B

554
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:20,952
That's Plan B?

555
00:54:21,023 --> 00:54:22,285
No! Plan A!

556
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:23,188
What's plan B?

557
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,417
You'll see!

558
00:56:12,501 --> 00:56:13,490
Go!

559
00:56:17,106 --> 00:56:18,698
Think you can trust me now?

560
00:56:18,774 --> 00:56:20,742
Sorry. You're just so young to be C.I.A.

561
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:22,868
Young?
We've got people who are eighteen!

562
00:56:26,415 --> 00:56:28,815
What is this? I'm one of you!

563
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,815
NS1 Special Ops!

564
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:32,251
We know who you are

565
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:33,879
Then you know I'm undercover!

566
00:56:34,623 --> 00:56:36,113
Yes. I know

567
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:45,998
You're a disgrace to the C.I.A.
Get him out of my sight!

568
00:56:52,474 --> 00:56:54,635
All units! Search for the disc

569
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,004
Nice kick!

570
00:56:59,081 --> 00:57:02,073
Thank you.
We couldn't have done this without you

571
00:57:02,151 --> 00:57:03,448
Anybody would do it

572
00:57:03,786 --> 00:57:05,913
One thing I never forget
my father told me

573
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,478
Always do the right thing

574
00:57:07,556 --> 00:57:09,046
and stop the people who don't

575
00:57:09,124 --> 00:57:10,785
I wish everyone taught
their children that

576
00:57:10,859 --> 00:57:11,689
And don't worry,

577
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,323
Thank you

578
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:20,333
One last thing. Have you got the disc?

579
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:27,170
He also told me, respect nature

580
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,446
I dropped it somewhere

581
00:57:33,515 --> 00:57:34,675
I know

582
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,782
Where are you going?

583
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,009
Africa
