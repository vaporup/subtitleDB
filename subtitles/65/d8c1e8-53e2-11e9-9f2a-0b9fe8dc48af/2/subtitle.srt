1
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:06,643
When did you come back?

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,780
Why?

3
00:00:08,418 --> 00:00:10,113
You're so happy to see me

4
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:15,257
I came to get my trousseau

5
00:00:17,394 --> 00:00:19,885
Just kidding, let's go!

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:20,858
Great

7
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,589
Any new girlfriend?

8
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,664
Since I left?

9
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:26,766
No woman...

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,402
can tolerate...

11
00:00:30,307 --> 00:00:31,501
my drawbacks

12
00:00:33,043 --> 00:00:34,772
Have some self-confidence

13
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:39,980
You're so nice

14
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,681
I feel safe when I'm with you

15
00:00:44,087 --> 00:00:46,920
You'll do anything to help me

16
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:48,024
And take care of me

17
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:51,658
I wish I'd known you...

18
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,820
...before he did

19
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:55,824
Impossible

20
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,823
He knew me at birth

21
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,468
Watched me grow up

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,128
Is he handsome?

23
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:04,667
Old and ugly

24
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,867
Protective too

25
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:14,107
Wake up, let's go

26
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:17,582
Do you know why I came?

27
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,347
Your trousseau

28
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:23,756
Before I met you

29
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,126
I had never dated anyone but

30
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:29,521
My fiance Shunichi Kikukawa

31
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:32,201
And after we met?

32
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,202
After we met

33
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:36,865
I discovered...

34
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,032
It's not how long you've known each other

35
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:42,135
But how you feel

36
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:46,844
I never thought of him while I was here

37
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:52,753
But I missed you every day in Japan

38
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,957
Love is different from friendship

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,549
So

40
00:01:59,462 --> 00:02:00,929
I've decided not to marry

41
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,031
What are you doing?

42
00:02:04,467 --> 00:02:05,729
Calling my mom

43
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,335
To tell her to cancel the wedding

44
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:34,355
Happy?

45
00:02:36,266 --> 00:02:37,893
Answer me

46
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:57,953
Blue sky, I wonder why

47
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,881
You left out the rainbow

48
00:03:01,358 --> 00:03:04,350
Cars jammed like busy bees

49
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,930
Who will look at me

50
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,994
The world may be exciting

51
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:15,167
I see just black and white

52
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:19,004
Nothing to love. Nothing to hate

53
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,201
Wherever the music

54
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,349
My shadow follows

55
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,584
And dances with me

56
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:33,449
My lonely, silent world

57
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:36,456
Had no beauty

58
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,718
My black, my white

59
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,863
They were my future

60
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:45,864
I knew, I must wait

61
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,636
For someone

62
00:03:48,138 --> 00:03:51,335
To become my colour

63
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,039
ooh... lonely eyes

64
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,574
You are the ocean

65
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,777
Come to me

66
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,605
Open my dreams

67
00:04:01,384 --> 00:04:02,510
ooh baby

68
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:06,050
I can't wait; a new life

69
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,588
A new heartbeat

70
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:14,626
You are my only colour

71
00:05:25,268 --> 00:05:28,203
Blue sky, I wonder why

72
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:31,472
You left out the rainbow

73
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,969
Cars jammed like busy bees

74
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:38,678
Who will look at me

75
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,675
The world may be exciting

76
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:46,014
I see just black and white

77
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:49,692
Nothing to love. Nothing to hate

78
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:52,919
Wherever the music

79
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,192
My shadow follows

80
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,598
And dances with me

81
00:06:01,004 --> 00:06:04,064
My lonely, silent world

82
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:07,267
Had no beauty

83
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:14,273
Baby, what's your name?

84
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:15,581
My name is...

85
00:06:15,652 --> 00:06:16,744
Dreamy Wong!

86
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,688
I'm sorry

87
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,224
My black, my white

88
00:06:27,397 --> 00:06:29,729
They were my future

89
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:34,467
I knew, I must wait

90
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:36,434
For someone

91
00:06:36,506 --> 00:06:39,703
To become my colour

92
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,607
ooh... lonely eyes

93
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,336
You are my ocean

94
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:45,514
Come to me

95
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:49,382
Open my dreams

96
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:51,050
ooh baby

97
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:54,451
I can't wait; a new life

98
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:58,593
A new heartbeat

99
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,624
Here

100
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:03,828
They were my future

101
00:07:06,903 --> 00:07:08,393
Thanks

102
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:10,670
For someone

103
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,868
To become my colour

104
00:07:14,377 --> 00:07:15,674
ooh... lonely eyes

105
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,472
You are my ocean

106
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,773
My cold!

107
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:23,247
Open my dreams

108
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,148
ooh baby

109
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,019
Don't worry

110
00:07:28,858 --> 00:07:32,521
A new heartbeat

111
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:37,423
You are my only colour

112
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,455
Welcome, Chairman, to Shanghai

113
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:02,653
We're ready...

114
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:05,020
I came to find my daughter

115
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:11,390
She should still be in town

116
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,263
Before she leaves

117
00:08:15,304 --> 00:08:16,828
I must find her

118
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,341
- Let them see
- Yes

119
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:24,846
I announce

120
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:27,548
My son-in-law and I will reward

121
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,876
$3 million RMB

122
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,779
Find her first

123
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,790
Whoever finds my daughter

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,969
Will get all the money

125
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,706
Sorry

126
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,166
It's my fault

127
00:08:56,212 --> 00:08:58,237
You're so ill

128
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:01,145
Need a doctor?

129
00:09:02,452 --> 00:09:04,317
No doctors

130
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,420
I hate doctors

131
00:09:08,357 --> 00:09:10,120
Just take care of me

132
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,293
I want congee

133
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,932
Yuri...

134
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,274
Eat; then take your medicine

135
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,605
I've never made congee before

136
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:33,508
Thanks

137
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:54,530
Yuri...

138
00:09:54,604 --> 00:09:57,402
It's 3:00. Time for medicine

139
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,307
Must you be so punctual?

140
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,935
Yes, you'll get better faster

141
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:06,681
- Get up
- Thanks

142
00:10:15,892 --> 00:10:16,790
Congee is ready

143
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:18,151
Congee again?

144
00:10:18,528 --> 00:10:20,223
I'm well. Let's eat out

145
00:10:20,296 --> 00:10:21,593
I don't want congee every day

146
00:10:21,898 --> 00:10:23,092
It's only been 2 days

147
00:10:24,233 --> 00:10:25,131
What?

148
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:26,891
Two days

149
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,294
Two days?

150
00:10:28,504 --> 00:10:30,472
Let's go. My mom will find me

151
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,131
Let's go now...

152
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,196
You must eat

153
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,774
You're too weak

154
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:39,078
I'm still sick

155
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:40,472
You are?

156
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,179
What shall we do?

157
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,150
I'm heartsick

158
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:48,255
Do you treat all women so well?

159
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,425
Or just me?

160
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,425
Come, tell me

161
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:55,996
Tell me you only love me

162
00:10:56,065 --> 00:10:58,295
You only treat me so well

163
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:59,901
Then my heart will recover

164
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,794
Tell me, good friend

165
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,363
I love to hear it

166
00:11:05,775 --> 00:11:06,764
I shouldn't

167
00:11:10,112 --> 00:11:12,103
I shouldn't?

168
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:13,640
Get out!

169
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,285
I never want to see you again!

170
00:11:17,587 --> 00:11:19,077
Go to hell!

171
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:20,849
I'll get the door

172
00:11:23,593 --> 00:11:25,117
I shouldn't?!

173
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,329
Coco?

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,392
Is Yuri here?

175
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:33,526
In the room

176
00:11:34,904 --> 00:11:36,838
All Shanghai is looking for her

177
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,063
There's a $3 million reward

178
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,833
I'm afraid

179
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:41,672
they'll come here

180
00:11:42,645 --> 00:11:44,237
Look, Yuri

181
00:11:47,817 --> 00:11:50,251
My mom is good at this

182
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,880
Let's go

183
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:54,420
Thanks!

184
00:12:03,032 --> 00:12:04,124
The stairs!

185
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,097
Open the door

186
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,395
Yuri's here! Come out...

187
00:12:52,515 --> 00:12:53,709
Mr. Wong, here are

188
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,612
Two tickets on the next flight to Beijing

189
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,480
It takes off at 3, at Gate 17

190
00:12:58,554 --> 00:12:59,680
Thanks

191
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,518
Beijing first, then the Siberian Express

192
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,421
To Eastern Europe through Russia

193
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:05,457
Fly to Paris, sail to Morocco

194
00:13:05,995 --> 00:13:07,519
They won't guess that route

195
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:10,495
We'll enjoy ourselves in Africa

196
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,325
- Africa?
- Isn't it exciting?

197
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:13,696
I've always wanted to go

198
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,201
I love lions and elephants

199
00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:18,134
You don't want to?

200
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,369
I'll go anywhere with you

201
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,508
Beijing...

202
00:13:25,014 --> 00:13:26,208
- Let's go
- Wait

203
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,810
- Help, Philip!
- Henry?

204
00:13:30,886 --> 00:13:32,046
Yuri's fiance is holding...

205
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:32,916
...Nancy and me...

206
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:34,115
...at knife point

207
00:13:34,223 --> 00:13:36,191
They said if you don't bring Yuri back now

208
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:39,489
He'll throw us in the river

209
00:13:39,662 --> 00:13:41,459
I think he's a man of his word

210
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,029
Help!

211
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,631
Henry...

212
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,137
What is it?

213
00:13:50,973 --> 00:13:52,440
Henry said...

214
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,334
I must go take care of something

215
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,243
- Now?
- Yes

216
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:00,246
We fly in 2 hours

217
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:02,712
It's close by. I'll be back soon

218
00:14:02,985 --> 00:14:04,418
- I'll go with you
- No!

219
00:14:05,521 --> 00:14:06,818
It's dangerous

220
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:07,955
Come!

221
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,150
Hide; come out only when I call

222
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,497
- I'll be back soon
- Hurry

223
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,168
You're Philip Wong?

224
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,441
You're Shunichi Kikukawa?

225
00:14:29,512 --> 00:14:30,638
You dirty scumbag!

226
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,308
You terrorize my friends

227
00:14:32,882 --> 00:14:34,179
And you're eating cake!

228
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:37,515
Where are they?

229
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,321
You came quickly

230
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,714
Such a good friend!

231
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:49,564
You're at knife point?

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,558
Why are you eating chicken?

233
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,107
My baby cancels her wedding for you?

234
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,003
I thought you'd be handsome

235
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:05,941
So plain

236
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,415
You're... Auntie?

237
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,753
I don't know you

238
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,247
Call me Madame Sakurada

239
00:15:15,391 --> 00:15:17,188
This is my son-in-law

240
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,262
I'm Shunichi Kikukawa, nice to meet you

241
00:15:27,436 --> 00:15:28,596
You're Shunichi Kikukawa?

242
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:30,727
I'm just the translator

243
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,468
Ask before you grab next time

244
00:15:35,211 --> 00:15:37,145
Mom, let me talk to him

245
00:15:42,952 --> 00:15:46,080
Sorry my Yuri caused you so much trouble

246
00:15:49,024 --> 00:15:51,288
She's a playful girl

247
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:54,460
Loves practical jokes

248
00:15:56,031 --> 00:15:57,862
She wants to cancel the wedding!

249
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,796
Sorry

250
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,036
No one is clearer than I

251
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:10,578
That it was a moment of passion

252
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:13,209
It hurts!

253
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:17,149
So, sir, I hope...

254
00:16:17,386 --> 00:16:19,445
You'll forgive Yuri

255
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:27,994
Yes

256
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:30,265
We have

257
00:16:30,332 --> 00:16:34,325
the same necklace

258
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,307
Why?

259
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:41,933
Presents from Yuri

260
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:43,843
Now you see?

261
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:50,578
Bring her back

262
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:55,781
We'll take together, you'll know

263
00:16:57,726 --> 00:17:00,820
If Yuri really loves you

264
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:02,926
You're untouchable

265
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,830
- Philip!
- Don't talk to me!

266
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:13,940
You cried for help to get me back

267
00:17:14,276 --> 00:17:15,573
And you're eating chicken!

268
00:17:16,478 --> 00:17:17,945
Why did you lie to me?

269
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,580
Her mom and fiance are understanding

270
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,580
So we called you back to help

271
00:17:22,785 --> 00:17:23,979
Wake up

272
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,017
We're doing it for you

273
00:17:26,388 --> 00:17:29,152
She's a powerful princess

274
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,256
He's a powerful man

275
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:32,259
They're made for each other!

276
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:33,361
A perfect match!

277
00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:35,363
- A great pair!
- Match made in Heaven!

278
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,795
Your backgrounds are different

279
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,732
They're made for each other!

280
00:17:40,903 --> 00:17:42,632
As are you and Coco!

281
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,500
Don't break them up

282
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,602
Don't block their way

283
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:48,973
Don't block my way!

284
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,382
Yuri...

285
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:59,151
Are you all right?

286
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:02,790
You've thought about this?

287
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,759
It isn't a moment of passion?

288
00:18:05,594 --> 00:18:07,755
Of course it is, that's love

289
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,261
No one knows what's next

290
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:10,261
But I know...

291
00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:12,391
...I won't regret this

292
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:16,671
We'll be in Africa

293
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,805
We may have problems

294
00:18:21,277 --> 00:18:22,710
You're not just playing?

295
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,809
Do you think I am?

296
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,139
Why did you lie to me?

297
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:30,852
Shunichi Kikukawa is not bad

298
00:18:31,754 --> 00:18:33,949
Why did you say he's old and ugly?

299
00:18:35,457 --> 00:18:37,084
You checked up on me?

300
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:39,489
When did you see him?

301
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:41,423
What else are you hiding from me?

302
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,191
You don't trust me?

303
00:18:46,068 --> 00:18:47,831
You have no faith in me?

304
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:52,164
I have no faith in myself

305
00:18:53,742 --> 00:18:55,903
I afraid I won't be good enough

306
00:18:57,212 --> 00:18:59,077
Afraid I cannot give you happiness

307
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:02,079
Afraid of many other things

308
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:04,316
Like what?

309
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,478
I'm not afraid of you, but you are of me?

310
00:19:07,256 --> 00:19:09,383
I asked you to say "I like you"

311
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:12,352
You said "I shouldn't"

312
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:15,620
Do you know

313
00:19:15,898 --> 00:19:16,660
How a woman feels

314
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,290
hearing that?

315
00:19:23,639 --> 00:19:25,937
Sounds like I have a crush on you

316
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,377
I know

317
00:19:30,012 --> 00:19:32,378
You don't want the responsibility

318
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,574
You're selfish

319
00:19:37,586 --> 00:19:40,214
Otherwise, say it

320
00:19:42,691 --> 00:19:45,489
I...

321
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:46,858
I what?

322
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,428
You can't say it

323
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,658
Because you're the one just playing

324
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,838
And you betrayed me

325
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:01,799
Thank you

326
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:04,671
Split the $3 million among yourselves

327
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,509
No need, it's so much money

328
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:11,349
No need...

329
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,221
Henry, give it back!

330
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:18,119
Thank you...

331
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:19,817
Yuri, I didn't!

332
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,956
No, you didn't like me

333
00:20:25,501 --> 00:20:27,799
I was wrong about you

334
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,200
It's okay

335
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:39,610
He bullied me

336
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,641
Silly girl, no one does that when I'm around

337
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,784
No one can harm you

338
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,654
Too soft, I can't hear him

339
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,021
I can't translate

340
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,792
Mom, I'll return to Japan,

341
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,219
Marry Kikukawa

342
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,568
You scared me to death

343
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,331
Let's go This way

344
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:03,564
She said Let's go

345
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,903
End of translation

346
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:03,555
Great dancing!

347
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:06,360
Everything's back to normal

348
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,168
You worked hard, dry off

349
00:22:16,512 --> 00:22:17,706
Traitor!

350
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:19,504
I didn't betray you

351
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:21,212
They followed me.

352
00:22:21,483 --> 00:22:23,348
Could I stop them?

353
00:22:23,785 --> 00:22:25,878
They gave me money

354
00:22:28,824 --> 00:22:30,451
Could I refuse?

355
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:10,595
Must we do that, too?

356
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:11,960
Are you all right?

357
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:18,665
Still angry?

358
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,704
Will you feel better if you hit me?

359
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,805
I'll let you!

360
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:25,437
Hit me!

361
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:30,950
I'll have 3 years bad luck

362
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,512
Just once

363
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,497
We've been friends...

364
00:23:47,769 --> 00:23:49,532
...since I left Malaysia

365
00:23:49,938 --> 00:23:53,396
Twenty years

366
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,910
It's for your own good

367
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,907
Your relationship had to be tested

368
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,176
It's better to test it sooner

369
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:05,819
So you can find out

370
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:09,589
Are you still angry at me?

371
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,956
Are you?

372
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,330
Stop

373
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:23,367
Can't you see I've changed?

374
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:25,437
Let's have fun!

375
00:24:26,074 --> 00:24:27,541
That's right

376
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,178
Leave some for me

377
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,048
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

378
00:24:36,151 --> 00:24:37,618
Hi!

379
00:24:38,954 --> 00:24:40,012
You're here

380
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:44,852
We came to see you

381
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,556
You're not so cool today

382
00:24:49,731 --> 00:24:51,631
He's hot now

383
00:24:53,101 --> 00:24:55,160
When can we go out?

384
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,928
You won't turn off your phone?

385
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,873
Call me, I'll keep it on...

386
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:01,264
...for you

387
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:03,304
You turned it off for me

388
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:06,942
You're different

389
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:09,510
Come!

390
00:25:11,353 --> 00:25:15,847
Can you handle both?

391
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,086
Let me have one

392
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,954
What?

393
00:25:21,997 --> 00:25:23,521
What?

394
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:28,159
Selfishness brings bad luck

395
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,137
- Stop it!
- Where to?

396
00:25:31,473 --> 00:25:32,770
Your home

397
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:34,438
What for?

398
00:25:34,643 --> 00:25:36,634
Coffee

399
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,145
Let's go, don't want to see

400
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:41,677
Am I famous?

401
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,618
For my coffee?

402
00:25:45,954 --> 00:25:47,012
Got it!

403
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:50,654
Coffee time

404
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:53,061
Where's the coffee?

405
00:25:58,233 --> 00:25:59,666
Where are you?

406
00:26:05,574 --> 00:26:08,099
What are you looking at?

407
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:09,700
Aren't you getting coffee for us?

408
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:11,344
Who are they?

409
00:26:12,781 --> 00:26:14,874
- Where are you?
- Wait!

410
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:18,481
March 31

411
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,587
Marriage? Whose?

412
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,803
Dreamy Wong!

413
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,837
Coco?

414
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,118
Why are you here?

415
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,020
You want fulfillment?

416
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,461
Might as well be me

417
00:27:02,631 --> 00:27:04,064
I'm not so bad

418
00:27:05,233 --> 00:27:06,461
Don't do that

419
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:11,038
You want a twosome?

420
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,768
Nancy!

421
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:18,969
Okay, you're a bore

422
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:22,150
But for a friend

423
00:27:22,918 --> 00:27:25,443
What are you doing? Get up!

424
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,648
Here's one more!

425
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,185
Although I'm not gay

426
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:32,090
You wouldn't share with me just now

427
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:33,819
I'll let you do it!

428
00:27:34,296 --> 00:27:35,991
For my good friend...

429
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,691
...who was hurt by love

430
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:41,864
I sacrifice myself

431
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:48,939
To rescue you from the abyss

432
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,577
Although I'm too plump

433
00:27:52,247 --> 00:27:55,478
Hope you don't mind

434
00:27:55,684 --> 00:27:57,584
You got it wrong

435
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,617
Am I like that?

436
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:01,815
It's only a coffee date

437
00:28:02,023 --> 00:28:03,513
I know you're not like that

438
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:04,817
You miss Yuri

439
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:06,423
I'm not through yet

440
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:07,722
Don't try to stop me

441
00:28:07,829 --> 00:28:08,955
Philip!

442
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:12,128
I've decided

443
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,637
I'm going to Japan tomorrow for her

444
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,807
I don't care

445
00:28:25,947 --> 00:28:27,312
As a traitor...

446
00:28:28,316 --> 00:28:31,410
I should repay you by going with you

447
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,082
We'll go, too

448
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:34,619
Are you traitors?

449
00:28:34,823 --> 00:28:36,256
With passports?

450
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:39,020
You know the way, Traitor?

451
00:28:39,694 --> 00:28:40,888
It's easy

452
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:44,096
Fly to Narita Airport, Tokyo

453
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:45,759
I know that

454
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:47,493
Take the JR Express...

455
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:48,933
...to Shinjuku Exit

456
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:50,096
When you get out of the station,

457
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:52,264
There's a Sakura Department Store there

458
00:28:53,308 --> 00:28:56,175
See?

459
00:28:56,344 --> 00:28:57,777
Here's one

460
00:28:58,313 --> 00:29:00,372
How can we find her?

461
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:02,916
Start with this branch

462
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,543
That's crazy

463
00:29:05,053 --> 00:29:06,714
Sakura Enterprises

464
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:09,115
Wedding-tomorrow-11:00 a.m.

465
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,125
- Summer Shrine

466
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,489
Let's crash the party!

467
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:34,905
The wedding has just started

468
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:12,820
Hurry!

469
00:30:12,887 --> 00:30:15,754
After she drinks

470
00:30:15,824 --> 00:30:17,883
They'll be legally married!

471
00:30:18,093 --> 00:30:19,117
Say it now

472
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:21,292
I object!

473
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:23,087
Yuri!

474
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:25,059
I object!

475
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,365
I object!

476
00:30:26,634 --> 00:30:27,760
I object!

477
00:30:30,505 --> 00:30:32,370
- Get them out!
- Yuri!

478
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:35,905
I must speak to you!

479
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,569
- Say it!
- Yuri!

480
00:30:37,645 --> 00:30:39,306
Mom, the press is here

481
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:42,643
Don't use violence

482
00:30:43,018 --> 00:30:44,542
Yuri!

483
00:30:46,287 --> 00:30:47,413
Let him speak

484
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,451
Let go of him

485
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,532
Speak

486
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:07,270
Many told me to come

487
00:31:08,276 --> 00:31:11,268
But most of all

488
00:31:11,846 --> 00:31:13,245
I wanted to

489
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:15,506
Because most of all, I feared...

490
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:17,985
...losing you

491
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:21,182
If I didn't come

492
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:23,554
I'd regret it...

493
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:25,621
...all my life

494
00:31:27,996 --> 00:31:29,554
I was always...

495
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,589
...insecure

496
00:31:33,368 --> 00:31:35,302
and lack of self confidence

497
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:40,938
Saw only black and white

498
00:31:42,977 --> 00:31:44,604
Then I met you

499
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:48,214
I felt colours

500
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,050
You...

501
00:31:51,719 --> 00:31:54,654
...filled my life with colour

502
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,584
You appreciate me the most

503
00:31:59,928 --> 00:32:01,361
You said...

504
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,889
...you chose cherry blossoms

505
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:06,489
For their...

506
00:32:07,102 --> 00:32:08,729
...short-lived glory

507
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,868
I tell you

508
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:16,169
I choose that, too

509
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,508
So I had to take this chance

510
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:22,810
I may not be able...

511
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:27,215
...to change your mind

512
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:29,116
But I must say it

513
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:32,822
I dared not say these words

514
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:39,562
I feared losing you

515
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:44,234
But...

516
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:47,106
...if I dare not say them

517
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:50,538
I cannot tell you

518
00:32:51,446 --> 00:32:53,710
I'll take care of you all your life

519
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:57,446
Yuri...

520
00:32:59,053 --> 00:33:00,543
I love you!

521
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,626
I love you?

522
00:33:15,737 --> 00:33:17,170
I'm touched

523
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:18,664
Thank you

524
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:23,676
This is the best wedding gift

525
00:33:27,448 --> 00:33:29,109
But sorry

526
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,882
You're too late

527
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,202
I wish to complete the ceremony

528
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:56,809
Go now

529
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:32,844
Give him this, a present

530
00:34:32,914 --> 00:34:36,350
To thank him for coming

531
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:38,245
Yes, sir

532
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:45,224
Take this, from them

533
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,920
Thanks for coming

534
00:34:49,063 --> 00:34:50,621
You may go

535
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:06,113
Pardon us

536
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:08,645
Sorry

537
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:27,689
What a waste

538
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,161
You didn't open the fan?

539
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:36,099
Don't want to

540
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,472
Don't take my fan!

541
00:36:39,607 --> 00:36:42,542
No, look

542
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,577
April 1 st, that's today

543
00:36:45,713 --> 00:36:46,907
I'll wait for you...

544
00:36:46,981 --> 00:36:48,505
...at 11 a.m.

545
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:49,777
Ueno Park

546
00:36:50,084 --> 00:36:52,746
One hour ago, not too bad

547
00:36:53,454 --> 00:36:55,718
She's already married

548
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:58,682
And it's April Fool's Day

549
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,457
Up to you

550
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:04,064
It's okay to be late

551
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,533
We're leaving

552
00:37:59,587 --> 00:38:01,145
Please, stop!

553
00:38:01,222 --> 00:38:02,621
Great! Hurry!

554
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,059
Hi!

555
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:52,566
Are you looking for someone?

556
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,672
You are...

557
00:38:54,175 --> 00:38:55,301
You don't know me

558
00:38:55,409 --> 00:38:56,876
But you should know my lover

559
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,275
His name is Shunichi Kikukawa

560
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:02,649
Shinjuku... Colour?

561
00:39:03,417 --> 00:39:04,850
I don't understand

562
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,677
Or Kikukawa Shunichi

563
00:39:07,021 --> 00:39:08,113
Kikukawa Shun...

564
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:11,585
...ichi?

565
00:39:12,126 --> 00:39:13,593
Hello

566
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:17,063
My girlfriend

567
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,599
Excuse me?

568
00:39:26,173 --> 00:39:29,199
Yuri's and my late fathers were friends

569
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:33,177
They planned our wedding

570
00:39:34,949 --> 00:39:37,816
In conjunction...

571
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:40,649
...with our companies merging

572
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,287
When the news spread

573
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:50,827
Our share prices kept going up

574
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,606
To maintain this trend

575
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:02,034
Even though Yuri and I...

576
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:04,608
...are like siblings

577
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,048
We had to get married

578
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:09,876
Which I needed,

579
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:11,609
to get my inheritance

580
00:40:13,854 --> 00:40:17,790
But she nearly canceled for you

581
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,651
Fortunately at the airport

582
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:24,764
I was able to explain it to her

583
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:27,331
And she was willing

584
00:40:27,468 --> 00:40:30,631
To be my wife in name

585
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,876
She also wanted to test you

586
00:40:39,246 --> 00:40:41,305
We were worried

587
00:40:42,717 --> 00:40:44,446
But you came

588
00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:47,520
The fan was not made in vain

589
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,287
We'll secretly...

590
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,551
...divorce soon

591
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:57,120
Where is she?

592
00:40:58,633 --> 00:41:00,225
Dreamy Wong!

593
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:01,930
You're late!

594
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:10,233
Come, see the cherry blossoms

595
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:11,710
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

596
00:41:11,979 --> 00:41:13,344
Goodbye...

597
00:42:03,931 --> 00:42:04,727
I've been practicing

598
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:11,530
Come
