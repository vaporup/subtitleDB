1
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:31,903
Hey look,

2
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:36,068
Look at that hunk on stage!

3
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:38,235
Single

4
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:42,439
26 years, 38 months

5
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,208
A body of

6
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:46,816
40.05,

7
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,485
25.52,

8
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,885
36.36!

9
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:57,459
Are you lonely?

10
00:01:58,098 --> 00:02:02,034
- Want to know him?
- Yes!

11
00:02:02,202 --> 00:02:04,864
Any age or gender

12
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:08,936
He'll be your teacher

13
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:12,569
Right

14
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:15,046
He's Dance Fit Studio's...

15
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:20,178
Philip Wong!

16
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:45,710
We've combined keeping fit

17
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,311
With self-defense

18
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:51,173
A new idea!

19
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:52,784
Join our Studio today!

20
00:02:52,853 --> 00:02:56,846
Join our Dance Fit Studio!

21
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,326
You're watching 100 women

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,767
performing this kung-fu dance

23
00:03:11,037 --> 00:03:12,470
Combining

24
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:15,072
Kung-fu and dance

25
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:17,073
It will be so hot

26
00:03:17,377 --> 00:03:18,810
- Don't block my shot!
- Stop!

27
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,210
Sit down

28
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:27,119
I'm crashing, with your girl

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,651
That's double trouble

30
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:33,054
Give up and shut down

31
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,126
Your students can come to me

32
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:38,857
At King King Dance

33
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,791
Like she did

34
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:44,869
King, spare us

35
00:03:45,038 --> 00:03:47,768
Don't ruin our show

36
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:51,568
Get out! Shorty Henry!

37
00:04:02,088 --> 00:04:03,146
I don't know what you are talking about,

38
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:04,549
Anyway, no fighting here!

39
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:06,989
This is a dance contest

40
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:08,219
That's fine

41
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:11,995
Clear the stage

42
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:12,895
Music!

43
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,438
- Come back!
- I'm a friend

44
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,001
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

45
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,700
No entry!

46
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:07,954
Useless!

47
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,119
Sorry. You okay?

48
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:15,058
Are you okay? Sorry

49
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:15,889
Bye

50
00:05:17,597 --> 00:05:18,723
Who are you?

51
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,231
Your surprise guest

52
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:26,297
Bye!

53
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:51,187
A drink, Handsome?

54
00:05:52,198 --> 00:05:53,165
I don't drink

55
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:54,795
Cigarettes?

56
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,534
I hate smokers!

57
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,563
You're so tall

58
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:00,706
I can't buy you drinks

59
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,506
- You're so tall!
- Ass!

60
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:06,903
Yes?

61
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:08,241
- Soda
- Two, please

62
00:06:08,682 --> 00:06:10,172
Hi, Philip!

63
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:13,247
We came to see you

64
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:16,547
You're too cool

65
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:17,985
And you're hot

66
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,222
When can we go out?

67
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,821
Call me,

68
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:24,657
I'll turn off my phone

69
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,089
You're too cool

70
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,292
And you're hot

71
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:33,172
Help me out

72
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,772
When people talk

73
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:38,072
Entertain them, okay?

74
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,076
Fine

75
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,272
Hi

76
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,212
My name is Juliana Francoise Roberts

77
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,181
What's your name?

78
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,350
Long name. Is it foreign?

79
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,785
Your dad is foreign? Your mom?

80
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,216
Which country?

81
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:58,086
You're mixed? Impossible

82
00:06:58,231 --> 00:06:59,960
You don't look it

83
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,234
You're faking

84
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,665
What are you?

85
00:07:07,707 --> 00:07:09,470
How rude

86
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:10,666
I was still talking

87
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:13,702
You're so wasteful

88
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,247
of Earth's resources

89
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:20,417
Fulfill a man's role

90
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:23,752
Comfort a woman's lonely heart

91
00:07:23,857 --> 00:07:25,552
Not picking on them

92
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:27,122
I'm like that

93
00:07:27,594 --> 00:07:29,391
He is like that

94
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:32,154
What's wrong? He's frank

95
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:34,299
I pity you, Henry

96
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,197
No woman likes you

97
00:07:38,972 --> 00:07:41,304
You, go away!

98
00:07:42,675 --> 00:07:44,199
- Thanks
- Thanks

99
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:49,277
The surprise guest

100
00:07:50,517 --> 00:07:51,711
You don't know her?

101
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:53,751
You've asked 20 times

102
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,980
I don't

103
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:56,850
She's pink

104
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,019
Pink?!

105
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,521
Are you kidding?

106
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:02,956
True pink

107
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:06,930
Felt like it

108
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:10,196
Your dad named you well

109
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,032
Shut up

110
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,803
Dreamy Wong!

111
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,103
Yes, Dreamy Wong!

112
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,736
Cheers

113
00:08:18,812 --> 00:08:19,744
Here's to our

114
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,641
Happiness!

115
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,513
Happiness?

116
00:08:28,488 --> 00:08:31,616
I wish

117
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,081
By all standards,

118
00:08:34,627 --> 00:08:36,822
I should be happy

119
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:39,157
Like

120
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:42,197
I look okay

121
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,733
Business going well

122
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:47,967
I'm big

123
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,336
Not there

124
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:52,977
Big-hearted

125
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:58,080
Well, I shouldn't be unhappy

126
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,278
But

127
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,513
One thing makes me very sad

128
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,954
I'm colourblind

129
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,025
Totally

130
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:12,692
I don't see colours

131
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,233
Only black and white

132
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:17,336
My thoughts are all gray

133
00:09:17,403 --> 00:09:18,335
Dazzling... cool... proper

134
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,437
I feel I'm dull

135
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,508
Insecure

136
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,912
But there's dancing

137
00:09:30,783 --> 00:09:32,011
When I dance

138
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:34,777
I'm in control

139
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,447
Just a little

140
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:42,720
Look at that

141
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:45,258
I'm horny

142
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:46,532
How strange

143
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:49,964
He's crazy

144
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:07,410
Henry

145
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,520
- Henry!
- Philip!

146
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:13,521
You know I can't see

147
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:15,827
What's on my jacket?

148
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,955
You hate rejection by woman

149
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,290
To avoid them

150
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,367
I prepared a jacket for you

151
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:24,401
Your jacket says...

152
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,867
What?

153
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:28,030
I'm horny

154
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,741
I'm horny?

155
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,148
Help me

156
00:10:40,253 --> 00:10:41,220
Surprise guest?

157
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:42,650
What is it?

158
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,858
They are after me

159
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,150
- Japanese?
- He says, beat it

160
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:49,190
What's going on?

161
00:11:02,408 --> 00:11:05,536
Let go

162
00:11:05,912 --> 00:11:06,606
No fighting!

163
00:11:06,946 --> 00:11:07,776
He hit me!

164
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:08,836
These Japanese...

165
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:10,177
Stop! You first

166
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:12,178
They are after that girl

167
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,150
What girl?

168
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:16,912
Where is she?

169
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:20,416
- Gone
- Gone?

170
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:23,685
Again

171
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:38,843
You're lucky this time

172
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,478
They didn't arrest you

173
00:11:42,515 --> 00:11:43,607
So strange

174
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,917
Seeing her

175
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,178
I felt...

176
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:50,555
A fireball

177
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,859
A pink fireball coming at me

178
00:11:54,193 --> 00:11:55,820
Pink?

179
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,620
Fire is red!

180
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,427
It felt like fire

181
00:12:03,903 --> 00:12:05,336
But

182
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,001
I've never felt that way

183
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:16,371
It's as if...

184
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,981
There are colours

185
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:22,881
Colours?!

186
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:32,756
Your eyes have recovered?

187
00:12:35,268 --> 00:12:37,930
You're doomed!

188
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:41,539
Pink means women trouble

189
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,269
Stay away from her

190
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,146
Superstitious!

191
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:55,143
- You're worse!
- You're worse!

192
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,255
- You are!
- You!

193
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,252
You're worse!

194
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,880
We've been here 2 hours

195
00:12:59,025 --> 00:13:00,390
Where's she?

196
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:02,821
Millions of people in Shanghai

197
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:06,127
It's hard to run into her again

198
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:09,663
But I did, twice

199
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:12,866
Surprise guest!

200
00:13:13,473 --> 00:13:14,405
So plump?

201
00:13:17,143 --> 00:13:19,907
Sorry, Miss P

202
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:21,209
You know her?

203
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,110
Yes

204
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:23,347
Her name is P?

205
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:24,946
For Pig

206
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:30,981
Women like your look

207
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:33,217
But they find you boring

208
00:13:33,526 --> 00:13:35,391
To fulfill you

209
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:38,192
Play quick

210
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,662
A one-night stand

211
00:13:42,068 --> 00:13:45,060
Sorry, not without love

212
00:13:45,571 --> 00:13:47,596
I'm different from you

213
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:50,533
Not again

214
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:53,545
I was cursed

215
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,941
For saying the wrong thing

216
00:13:57,416 --> 00:14:01,216
Don't be my stepmother

217
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:05,888
Daddy says stepmothers eat boys

218
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:08,921
Traitor!

219
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,892
I'll curse you all

220
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:15,027
You'll never know women's love

221
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,136
Once they know you love them

222
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:21,201
They'll leave you

223
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:24,372
You won't find true love!

224
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,570
That's a mighty curse

225
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:27,806
Since then

226
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:30,512
All Dad's women left

227
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,774
My words I love you

228
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,852
Scared women away

229
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:37,117
Even now

230
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:41,223
My romances end badly

231
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,189
So

232
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,265
Isn't that a horrible curse?

233
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:49,626
It's not the curse

234
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:51,394
They dumped you because...

235
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,104
you're boring

236
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,407
And if those nonsense could kill

237
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:57,298
You deserve to die

238
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,908
1,2,3,4

239
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:02,105
5,6,7,8

240
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,111
And right

241
00:15:06,586 --> 00:15:08,918
Left, once more

242
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,980
Left

243
00:15:13,092 --> 00:15:14,286
5,6,7,8

244
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,850
1,2,3,4,

245
00:15:16,062 --> 00:15:17,620
5,6,7,8...

246
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:20,027
1,2,3,4...

247
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:10,448
How's your head?

248
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:11,847
Fine

249
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:15,180
You left that day

250
00:16:15,554 --> 00:16:16,521
I was worried

251
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:19,020
I forgot to thank you

252
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,251
I'm Yuri

253
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,188
I'm Philip Wong

254
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:24,495
Dreamy Wong, right?

255
00:16:25,431 --> 00:16:27,058
Your students told me

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,763
Funny you came to my school

257
00:16:30,136 --> 00:16:32,604
After 2 chance encounters

258
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:34,228
I came to see you this time

259
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:35,737
To see me?

260
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,843
I need a bodyguard

261
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:40,803
Bodyguard?

262
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,779
I've been followed since I arrived

263
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:46,110
They want to kidnap me

264
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:48,509
Those Japanese?

265
00:16:49,188 --> 00:16:50,314
Why you?

266
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:51,854
Why Japanese?

267
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:54,686
You're Japanese? Rich family?

268
00:16:54,794 --> 00:16:55,954
You called the cops?

269
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:59,460
You have many enemies?

270
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,225
Why so many questions?

271
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,625
All right, I'll answer

272
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:08,205
My family has some money

273
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:11,604
And some enemies

274
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,569
I'm the chairman's daughter of Japan's...

275
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:17,343
Sakura Department Store

276
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,048
So no cops, no publicity

277
00:17:21,187 --> 00:17:23,417
You answered more than I asked

278
00:17:24,824 --> 00:17:26,621
We'll get along

279
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,387
I thought I'd bore you

280
00:17:28,527 --> 00:17:30,495
No, this is fun

281
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,287
I do that, too

282
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,192
Thanks

283
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:35,759
You appreciate me

284
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:37,560
No need to be that grateful

285
00:17:37,636 --> 00:17:39,570
It's no big deal

286
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,669
Why me, as a bodyguard?

287
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,036
I'm new in town; I know nobody

288
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:47,270
You seem silly and nice

289
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,142
You fight well

290
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,680
And look nice

291
00:17:52,752 --> 00:17:54,481
I have questions

292
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,584
Ask

293
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:56,779
Are you Japanese?

294
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,651
You speak Cantonese

295
00:17:59,024 --> 00:18:01,117
Japanese dad? Or mom?

296
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:03,893
And, Yuri is not Japanese

297
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:05,690
Tell me

298
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:07,963
I went to school

299
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,260
in Hong Kong

300
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:11,027
My full name is Yuriko Sakurada

301
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,394
From HKSG

302
00:18:12,738 --> 00:18:13,762
HKSG?

303
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,203
Dad's dad is from Honshu.

304
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:16,308
Dad's mom, Kyushu

305
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,433
Mom's mom, Suzhou.

306
00:18:17,576 --> 00:18:18,736
Mom's dad, Guangzhou

307
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,978
So, HKSG

308
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,176
I'm going to Suzhou; come

309
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:26,679
Of course!

310
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:27,877
Anywhere you go!

311
00:18:28,721 --> 00:18:29,745
No need to pay me

312
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,513
Why not?

313
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,419
You appreciate me

314
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,024
I'll show you around

315
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:36,818
Thanks!

316
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:46,029
We'll meet here, 9 a.m.

317
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,540
You okay? Come out

318
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,177
Sure

319
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:55,479
You're cute

320
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:56,913
If my husband hears about this

321
00:18:57,049 --> 00:18:58,448
I'm going to Suzhou with you

322
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:00,017
He'll die!

323
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:01,014
What?

324
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:02,515
Husband?

325
00:19:02,988 --> 00:19:05,252
Not yet

326
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:07,358
End of March

327
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,222
Isn't this a huge,

328
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,421
sparkly diamond?

329
00:19:11,263 --> 00:19:12,423
Very sparkly

330
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:14,525
From my fiance

331
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,892
After this Shanghai trip

332
00:19:15,968 --> 00:19:18,300
I'll return to Japan

333
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,006
And plan the wedding

334
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:25,306
You really okay? Come

335
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:29,570
Congratulations

336
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:31,642
You're hoarse

337
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,378
You wanted to flirt?

338
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,249
You're disappointed?

339
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,489
Will you still be...

340
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:42,524
...my bodyguard?

341
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:56,039
Should I go tomorrow?

342
00:19:57,576 --> 00:19:59,066
Should I?

343
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:03,572
Such a decision...

344
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,782
Needs some serious making

345
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,684
1, I go. 2, I stay

346
00:20:20,132 --> 00:20:21,429
Channel 3?

347
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,624
Please go

348
00:20:23,202 --> 00:20:24,362
I can't

349
00:20:24,603 --> 00:20:26,002
Please

350
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:27,336
I can't

351
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,573
Go to hell!

352
00:20:33,412 --> 00:20:35,380
Bad omen

353
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:40,449
Heads, I go

354
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:44,484
Tails, I stay

355
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,038
A coin from heaven!

356
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:02,537
What was that?

357
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:05,769
Two

358
00:21:08,147 --> 00:21:09,614
Two

359
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:11,980
Even...

360
00:21:13,552 --> 00:21:15,383
...means I go

361
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:22,918
I cannot escape my fate

362
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,831
No! Try again

363
00:21:27,967 --> 00:21:31,300
It's the sixth time

364
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:34,102
I counted wrong

365
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,968
Use these

366
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:38,336
Runes

367
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:44,311
I'm not superstitious

368
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:46,909
You're not?

369
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:50,120
Be her bodyguard; it's just a trip

370
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:52,086
Why the fuss?

371
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:54,221
Just go

372
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:58,529
You know I like her

373
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:00,891
What if...

374
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,227
I like her more?

375
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,764
She's getting married

376
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,536
Then, don't go

377
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,739
If anything happens to her

378
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,278
I'll never forgive myself

379
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:17,242
So, go!

380
00:22:18,017 --> 00:22:19,712
Didn't you hear me?

381
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:21,953
She's engaged

382
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,987
I can't have feelings for her

383
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:26,956
Keep your thoughts pure

384
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:29,856
If I can't control myself?

385
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:31,792
Then go...

386
00:22:32,164 --> 00:22:33,495
...to hell!

387
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,633
Then I'll miss my date

388
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:38,400
I must at least tell her

389
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,070
I can't go

390
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:45,203
Listen

391
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:48,406
All right?

392
00:22:57,856 --> 00:23:00,654
He hasn't much hair

393
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:05,788
Even, I go. Odd, I stay

394
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:16,939
Stay still!

395
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:18,203
Go to hell!

396
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,953
Wake up

397
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,488
Today is very important

398
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:05,883
What?

399
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,819
Seriously, which shirt?

400
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:11,062
Which bag?

401
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:16,230
This bag... with this shirt

402
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:17,859
Any bag will do

403
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,362
You were right, simple friends

404
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,307
On a simple trip

405
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:25,299
Keep it simple

406
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:29,947
I never said that

407
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:31,805
It's in your mind

408
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:34,510
I can tell

409
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,784
Can you?

410
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,857
I'm with you

411
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:40,850
Yes, you are

412
00:24:41,393 --> 00:24:42,917
Hurry, go

413
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,623
- It's late
- It's not

414
00:24:45,798 --> 00:24:47,026
It is

415
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,531
It's only 7!

416
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,302
I'm early

417
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,501
because she may be too

418
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,376
A cup of coffee

419
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:04,408
Freshes me up

420
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,447
Two and I'll be fresher

421
00:25:10,022 --> 00:25:12,582
It's still early

422
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:17,690
Make it three

423
00:25:19,131 --> 00:25:22,532
Four, I'm super fresh

424
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:26,704
It's nine

425
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,030
She'll come soon

426
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:35,608
Not now

427
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:37,475
Oh, please

428
00:25:38,951 --> 00:25:40,009
Don't go

429
00:25:40,285 --> 00:25:42,810
Stay here

430
00:25:43,722 --> 00:25:47,419
She'll be here any second

431
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:49,626
It hurts!

432
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:52,730
She can't see me like this

433
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:53,523
It hurts!

434
00:25:55,267 --> 00:26:01,206
Hurry...

435
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:06,906
Done

436
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:07,775
Did she come?

437
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:09,072
Did she leave?

438
00:26:09,414 --> 00:26:10,540
Two whole minutes

439
00:26:10,716 --> 00:26:15,585
She's gone

440
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,618
I stood her up

441
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,722
Stupid coffee

442
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:23,827
Stupid restroom

443
00:26:23,962 --> 00:26:25,156
I should have stayed

444
00:26:26,632 --> 00:26:28,259
- Been here long?
- No

445
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,899
Afraid I'd stand you up?

446
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:30,798
No

447
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:32,561
Come here

448
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:35,572
Morning, Dreamy!

449
00:26:36,008 --> 00:26:37,305
King? Why are you here?

450
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,639
We met last night at a disco

451
00:26:41,346 --> 00:26:43,814
You know him?

452
00:26:43,982 --> 00:26:45,609
You fight well, he knows the way

453
00:26:45,884 --> 00:26:47,545
I'm safer with you both

454
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,953
And it won't look like a date

455
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:54,154
Yuri, he shouldn't go

456
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:56,557
Three's a crowd

457
00:26:56,728 --> 00:26:57,990
I have relatives in Suzhou

458
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:01,332
I paid you to rent this?

459
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,132
My cousin got married yesterday

460
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:07,897
I borrowed it for luck

461
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:09,972
Fine. Who's driving?

462
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:28,789
Good move! You drive

463
00:27:29,061 --> 00:27:29,925
Get in, King

464
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,532
What's wrong?

465
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:38,097
I don't have a license

466
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,872
I know why

467
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,279
You're cute

468
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,040
I try to be

469
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:56,348
Let's go!

470
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:01,655
Yuri

471
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:02,921
Didn't we buy candy?

472
00:28:02,995 --> 00:28:04,292
- Yes
- Get them out

473
00:28:05,764 --> 00:28:06,594
Here

474
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:09,296
Tell Philip to get a green one

475
00:28:09,468 --> 00:28:10,901
We like the green ones

476
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,727
Pick a green one. They're good

477
00:28:15,173 --> 00:28:16,800
I... like them all

478
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:18,307
Come, pick one

479
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:25,982
Well?

480
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:27,977
Can't?

481
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,031
That one?

482
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,761
Isn't it good?

483
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,563
I said the green ones are best

484
00:28:48,673 --> 00:28:50,038
We like it.

485
00:28:50,976 --> 00:28:52,603
Yes, it's good

486
00:28:55,914 --> 00:28:57,211
You said he can't

487
00:28:57,549 --> 00:28:59,744
He was lucky

488
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:01,380
Are you hot?

489
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:04,187
Yes, very

490
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:05,854
Turn on the air conditioner

491
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:08,652
Yes, he's sweating

492
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,451
I'll turn it on

493
00:29:11,663 --> 00:29:13,255
Sweaty after one candy?

494
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:25,376
I don't have an address

495
00:29:25,844 --> 00:29:28,745
It's hard to find

496
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:30,871
I want that well

497
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:33,342
Why?

498
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:35,416
I exist because of it

499
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:36,919
No well, no me

500
00:29:37,823 --> 00:29:40,018
Years ago, grandma's mom

501
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:43,184
Refused to let her wed Grandpa

502
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:45,189
One night

503
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,627
They attempted suicide by...

504
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:49,790
...jumping into a well

505
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:52,258
Chor-Sing

506
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:57,532
You'll do anything for me?

507
00:29:58,477 --> 00:30:00,069
I...

508
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,887
What? Tell me

509
00:30:11,189 --> 00:30:12,816
One second

510
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:16,893
Hurry

511
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:19,292
I'm hurrying

512
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:22,526
Then say it

513
00:30:23,835 --> 00:30:24,961
Wait

514
00:30:31,109 --> 00:30:32,303
Right

515
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,445
We are in love

516
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:38,646
I'll do anything!

517
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:40,678
Really?

518
00:30:41,086 --> 00:30:42,451
Yes!

519
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:46,422
You jump, I jump

520
00:30:55,033 --> 00:30:58,560
Let's jump together

521
00:30:58,703 --> 00:30:59,567
Yes

522
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:02,270
- You are...
- Jump!

523
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:06,639
Someone jumped into the well!

524
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,640
A woman came by

525
00:31:08,713 --> 00:31:09,645
and rescued them

526
00:31:09,714 --> 00:31:11,045
Their parents...

527
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:13,141
...were moved

528
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,613
And let them wed

529
00:31:15,086 --> 00:31:16,417
If I find a man...

530
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:17,512
...like Grandpa

531
00:31:17,656 --> 00:31:19,146
I'll marry him

532
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:21,022
You jump...

533
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,958
I jump

534
00:31:25,664 --> 00:31:26,858
What?

535
00:31:30,235 --> 00:31:32,100
I mean...

536
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:34,465
Your fiance'

537
00:31:35,707 --> 00:31:37,800
He'll do anything for you

538
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:38,807
Of course!

539
00:31:38,877 --> 00:31:41,038
Or I'll strangle him

540
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:46,546
- So noisy
- Where...

541
00:31:47,152 --> 00:31:48,779
Where are we?

542
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:50,982
Your uncle's diner

543
00:31:51,122 --> 00:31:52,680
And we have no food!

544
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:54,318
But

545
00:31:54,392 --> 00:31:55,256
Hurry

546
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,392
Let's go

547
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:57,788
To the kitchen

548
00:31:58,463 --> 00:31:59,293
Come

549
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:02,491
It's hot...

550
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:10,964
Well?

551
00:32:12,711 --> 00:32:14,838
Smells so good!

552
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,911
You've never had this?

553
00:32:17,249 --> 00:32:19,149
It's soy sauce chicken

554
00:32:19,451 --> 00:32:20,782
My favorite

555
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:22,684
Have some soup

556
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:23,721
Sure

557
00:32:24,923 --> 00:32:25,890
Taste it

558
00:32:28,226 --> 00:32:28,988
Smells good

559
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:32,387
Well?

560
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,632
Delicious!

561
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:38,865
Try the chicken

562
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,964
Thanks

563
00:32:53,785 --> 00:32:55,980
You eat green chicken?

564
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:59,816
It's green, Colourblind

565
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:04,960
Food colouring is edible

566
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:07,962
And the tea

567
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:12,294
I was joking

568
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:14,565
You're really colourblind?

569
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:16,503
You were so lucky

570
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:17,938
You picked the green candy

571
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:19,374
By luck

572
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:21,407
No wonder...

573
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:22,774
...you can't drive

574
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,905
How do you cross the street?

575
00:33:25,016 --> 00:33:25,880
Can't see the traffic light

576
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:28,441
Oh, I'll bet you

577
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,214
Look at the symbols

578
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:32,614
Great idea

579
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:33,655
He has...

580
00:33:33,892 --> 00:33:36,122
...no other choice

581
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,453
Are you angry?

582
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,659
He's upset

583
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,036
Stay

584
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,435
Sorry, I didn't mean it

585
00:33:47,572 --> 00:33:50,302
Don't be angry

586
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,572
Sorry

587
00:33:52,711 --> 00:33:53,678
I was joking

588
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:57,609
You shouldn't be insecure

589
00:33:57,749 --> 00:33:59,148
Onion is blind and deaf,

590
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,239
but brave

591
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,848
Who? You know him well?

592
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,649
I saw it in a movie

593
00:34:06,091 --> 00:34:07,217
Happiness is most important

594
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:08,792
Self-confidence will follow

595
00:34:09,527 --> 00:34:11,654
Don't be angry

596
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,721
It's just colours; sorry

597
00:34:13,898 --> 00:34:15,229
There she is

598
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:19,636
They're after me

599
00:34:30,915 --> 00:34:32,280
Good moves!

600
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:33,247
Come help us!

601
00:34:33,518 --> 00:34:35,679
No, thanks

602
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:37,882
He left us!

603
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,260
Let's go

604
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,390
This is fun

605
00:34:46,831 --> 00:34:47,695
This way

606
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,826
- Hurry
- Here

607
00:34:51,636 --> 00:34:52,466
Hurry

608
00:34:55,907 --> 00:34:58,341
Go, hurry!

609
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:05,138
Go to hell...

610
00:35:05,884 --> 00:35:07,283
You bully...

611
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,315
Go to hell!

612
00:35:18,096 --> 00:35:19,222
- Let's go!
- Are you okay?

613
00:35:19,297 --> 00:35:20,321
Yes

614
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,127
It's fun

615
00:35:24,569 --> 00:35:25,900
Excuse me...

616
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,130
Excuse me

617
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:39,981
Quick!

618
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:44,644
Where are they?

619
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:50,216
Where are they?

620
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:53,295
Over that way

621
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:57,432
Over that way

622
00:36:03,775 --> 00:36:05,003
What?

623
00:36:05,643 --> 00:36:08,111
Isn't this exciting?

624
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,705
Hold on to me

625
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:17,545
- I can't
- No!

626
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:21,687
Are you okay?

627
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,952
Yes!

628
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:23,789
You're sure?

629
00:36:26,064 --> 00:36:27,827
I fell, you fell

630
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:31,132
You're right

631
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,299
You're all dirty

632
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:39,874
Look!

633
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,402
The moon! Trees!

634
00:36:42,814 --> 00:36:45,681
This must be my grandparents' well!

635
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:49,343
Most wells can see...

636
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:51,185
...the moon and trees

637
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,617
I say it is!

638
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:56,326
I'm so happy I found it!

639
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:57,652
Congratulations

640
00:36:57,896 --> 00:36:59,591
Not angry any more?

641
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:02,492
A little

642
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:08,036
That's just to thank you

643
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:09,569
I know

644
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:11,368
Your phone

645
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:15,002
I know how to get out

646
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:21,681
Coward! I despise you!

647
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:23,815
I don't want to see you again!

648
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:26,356
That's all?

649
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:29,456
I risked my life returning

650
00:37:29,894 --> 00:37:32,761
Give me more severance

651
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,399
That's not... enough?

652
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:38,566
Bitch!

653
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:41,637
You deserve each other

654
00:37:41,773 --> 00:37:44,333
Rot together then

655
00:37:45,276 --> 00:37:46,402
Coward!

656
00:37:46,578 --> 00:37:47,545
Sit over here

657
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,306
There goes our ride back

658
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,180
Great, we'll stay another day

659
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:55,350
Sure

660
00:37:56,054 --> 00:37:56,884
Hungry?

661
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,250
Of course

662
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,482
I'll buy some food

663
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:07,565
Isn't this romantic?

664
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:14,366
I thought you like to talk

665
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:15,966
You were quiet

666
00:38:16,074 --> 00:38:17,666
after we made fun of you

667
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:22,806
Actually...

668
00:38:24,315 --> 00:38:26,408
I'm a bad talker

669
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:31,652
I always make mistakes

670
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,025
So I'd rather talk less

671
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,458
I'm also that way

672
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,528
Follow your heart

673
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:43,725
Speak your mind

674
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,764
You're insecure with everything?

675
00:38:49,407 --> 00:38:50,374
Dancing

676
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,743
When I dance, I'm in control

677
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,471
That's easy

678
00:38:55,647 --> 00:38:57,842
Dance your words

679
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,308
You'll be confident

680
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:01,551
Like, I want to...

681
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,586
...take you out

682
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:05,623
Or better still

683
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,586
I love you

684
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:08,749
I can't say that!

685
00:39:09,394 --> 00:39:10,486
No?

686
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:13,021
Then, show it

687
00:39:13,131 --> 00:39:14,393
Dance it out

688
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:16,891
Express

689
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:18,002
Your feelings

690
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:19,835
It's easy

691
00:39:20,271 --> 00:39:21,169
Good idea

692
00:39:21,305 --> 00:39:22,067
Yes!

693
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:24,274
You dance badly

694
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:26,502
Do you know that?

695
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,570
I do

696
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:32,547
You can teach me

697
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:33,413
Sure

698
00:39:33,718 --> 00:39:34,548
An easy one

699
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:37,316
Para Para

700
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:39,282
- You can do that?
- Sure!

701
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,852
Para Para describes leaves

702
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,728
Floating to the ground

703
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:47,391
Float, float

704
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:51,200
Like our cherry blossoms in Japan

705
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:54,497
Floating like snowflakes

706
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,663
Short-lived

707
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,602
But glorious

708
00:39:57,742 --> 00:39:59,471
If only love...

709
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:02,579
...can be like that

710
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:06,650
Do you agree?

711
00:40:06,851 --> 00:40:09,445
Would you go for that?

712
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:15,018
Short-lived but glorious

713
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,583
- Come, teach me
- Sure

714
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:18,360
Watch

715
00:40:19,731 --> 00:40:24,134
Do this, here

716
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:25,601
Step...

717
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,159
Step...

718
00:40:26,304 --> 00:40:28,738
Slow down

719
00:40:30,308 --> 00:40:32,299
I can't follow

720
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:33,934
I'm stupid

721
00:40:34,212 --> 00:40:36,942
Here, turn your hand in

722
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,742
Like a floating leaf

723
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:42,648
Softly, down...

724
00:41:05,343 --> 00:41:06,674
Stop staring

725
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,712
Teach me

726
00:41:09,147 --> 00:41:12,344
Step, 45 degrees

727
00:41:12,617 --> 00:41:14,847
And here, then turn...

728
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:17,652
I can't follow!

729
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:19,215
Watch

730
00:41:55,059 --> 00:41:56,048
We'll miss the train!

731
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:58,525
I'm not ready to leave

732
00:41:58,596 --> 00:41:59,995
Let's stay longer!

733
00:42:00,364 --> 00:42:01,092
Sure

734
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,129
This hotel is famous

735
00:42:04,235 --> 00:42:05,930
Yes, it is

736
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,432
It looks interesting

737
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:08,402
Let's spend the night

738
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:11,740
Sure

739
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:14,607
In separate rooms

740
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:15,908
Fine

741
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:18,706
Two single rooms

742
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:22,178
Yuri, run!

743
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:26,082
Let him go!

744
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,484
Now!

745
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,250
Call the police!

746
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,227
Wait

747
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:33,391
Wait?

748
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,260
They are my bodyguards

749
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:36,433
Bodyguards?

750
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,730
Mom dislikes me traveling alone

751
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,599
She made them follow me

752
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:42,636
Like ghosts

753
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:44,736
I had hoped you could...

754
00:42:44,909 --> 00:42:46,274
...help me lose them

755
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,306
Why didn't you tell me?

756
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:49,970
You wouldn't have joined me, then

757
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:52,480
I wanted drama, fun, excitement

758
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:53,915
Yes!

759
00:42:54,218 --> 00:42:57,415
Madame wants to speak to you

760
00:42:58,656 --> 00:42:59,816
Mom

761
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:02,117
I know

762
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,059
Yes

763
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,592
Bye

764
00:43:10,501 --> 00:43:11,763
What did she say?

765
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:14,169
I'm flying to...

766
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:15,762
Japan tomorrow

767
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,272
Tomorrow?

768
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:21,609
So soon?

769
00:43:28,653 --> 00:43:30,553
Don't be mad

770
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:32,382
At what I did

771
00:43:32,857 --> 00:43:33,789
I'm not

772
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:36,456
I ran into you twice

773
00:43:36,827 --> 00:43:39,318
That's fate

774
00:43:39,597 --> 00:43:40,529
Stop here

775
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:41,762
There is where I live

776
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,764
Thanks for the lift

777
00:43:51,876 --> 00:43:53,901
I'm on the third floor

778
00:43:55,112 --> 00:43:56,340
It's been nice

779
00:43:58,282 --> 00:43:59,772
Have a good trip

780
00:44:00,751 --> 00:44:02,616
Will you come to Japan?

781
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:04,681
Pretty cherry blossoms

782
00:44:04,922 --> 00:44:05,889
Cherry blossoms?

783
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:09,683
April

784
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,556
You'll be married

785
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,887
Come to my wedding

786
00:44:18,703 --> 00:44:20,671
Goodbye

787
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,266
- Let's go
- Yes

788
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:28,140
Come see me off at 9

789
00:44:30,715 --> 00:44:31,647
Goodbye!

790
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,008
Bye!

791
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,073
The TV's on

792
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:00,706
Well

793
00:45:01,746 --> 00:45:03,304
Channel 1, I go

794
00:45:04,548 --> 00:45:05,810
Channel 2, I stay

795
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:15,284
2, then I stay

796
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:23,690
1, it's telling me to go

797
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:32,132
So I'll stay

798
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,677
So I'll go

799
00:45:40,885 --> 00:45:44,082
No

800
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:47,821
I've had it!

801
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,483
Choose a channel!

802
00:45:50,628 --> 00:45:51,925
I like to surf

803
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:55,491
You're confused

804
00:45:55,699 --> 00:45:57,098
I saw everything

805
00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:00,169
You want her, go chase her

806
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,900
How can I?

807
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,643
It's been only 3 days

808
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:12,110
There you go

809
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:14,080
Insecure again

810
00:46:14,685 --> 00:46:18,246
Give up then

811
00:46:18,622 --> 00:46:22,058
Hide under the bed and cry

812
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:23,125
Stay sad

813
00:46:23,594 --> 00:46:26,290
Play the tragic hero

814
00:46:31,235 --> 00:46:34,534
You're in too deep

815
00:46:57,628 --> 00:46:59,186
Sorry, sir

816
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:05,732
Once more

817
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,444
You're so tall...

818
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:18,045
How can I...

819
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,748
So rude!

820
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:24,845
I'm polite

821
00:47:27,191 --> 00:47:29,955
But you're not

822
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:31,718
Soda

823
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:34,621
See Lu Lu

824
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:37,834
She can break the curse

825
00:47:38,169 --> 00:47:38,999
No

826
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:40,828
Why not?

827
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:43,065
It can only help

828
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:45,742
- Go!
- Go!

829
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:46,707
No!

830
00:47:46,877 --> 00:47:48,071
Go!

831
00:47:48,212 --> 00:47:51,181
- Can't harm
- Don't push!

832
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:52,406
I said no!

833
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,249
I'm not superstitious!

834
00:47:58,822 --> 00:48:01,723
Hi! I'm Lu Lu

835
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,784
Thanks

836
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:12,226
Let's break this curse

837
00:48:24,882 --> 00:48:27,680
Isn't that great?

838
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:29,944
Like opera

839
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:31,382
Pay attention

840
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:34,721
He can tell?

841
00:48:35,125 --> 00:48:36,592
The crystal ball

842
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:39,426
Tarot cards, star charts

843
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:43,390
All predict

844
00:48:43,968 --> 00:48:46,368
A woman for you

845
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:49,330
Actually, she...

846
00:48:49,473 --> 00:48:51,338
...has been with you

847
00:48:52,509 --> 00:48:54,636
Your destinies are...

848
00:48:54,912 --> 00:48:57,608
...very closely knit

849
00:48:58,716 --> 00:49:00,411
Look near you

850
00:49:01,252 --> 00:49:04,983
Bye bye cure

851
00:49:06,457 --> 00:49:09,585
Not me, I like women

852
00:49:09,893 --> 00:49:13,021
Not me either

853
00:49:13,163 --> 00:49:14,824
Look there

854
00:49:18,168 --> 00:49:20,898
I don't ask much of love

855
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:25,706
He doesn't have to say...

856
00:49:26,677 --> 00:49:29,475
...he loves me

857
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:33,641
I'll be the woman behind him!

858
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,685
Are you all right?

859
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:41,250
Fine

860
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,617
I'm very friggin cold

861
00:49:43,827 --> 00:49:44,987
Frigid cold?

862
00:49:45,362 --> 00:49:47,296
Redundant

863
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:48,789
Hong Kong people...

864
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:50,163
...speak bad Chinese

865
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,235
Frigid cold!

866
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,697
Stupid!

867
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,528
I am very frigid cold

868
00:49:56,807 --> 00:50:00,334
Coco is high-strung, so what?

869
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:03,508
Your dance school in Hong Kong failed

870
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,545
In Shanghai,

871
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:06,348
She founded Dance Fit here with you

872
00:50:06,517 --> 00:50:07,745
And so successfully

873
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:10,315
She deserves it

874
00:50:10,688 --> 00:50:14,351
Let yourself be loved

875
00:50:14,491 --> 00:50:15,685
Enjoy it

876
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,690
Let Coco in

877
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:19,522
Okay?

878
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:23,257
Of course

879
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:26,836
She wined and dined you

880
00:50:27,604 --> 00:50:28,901
But

881
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,305
I have no feelings for her

882
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:37,273
Why are you so stubborn?

883
00:50:37,448 --> 00:50:38,881
I like being stubborn

884
00:50:38,982 --> 00:50:40,609
Suit yourself

885
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:42,083
Mr. Stubborn

886
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,054
God!

887
00:51:05,242 --> 00:51:08,405
For your cold

888
00:51:23,761 --> 00:51:25,422
Chest out, belly in
