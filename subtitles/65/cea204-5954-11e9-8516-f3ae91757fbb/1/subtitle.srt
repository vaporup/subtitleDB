1
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:01,847
<i>Attention, please.</i>

2
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,208
- Mr. Hamilton?
- Yes?

3
00:06:56,652 --> 00:06:58,586
Scarsdale is next.

4
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,434
Good day?

5
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:50,872
- You?
- Very productive.

6
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,966
Got the roses out in back
all trimmed.

7
00:07:55,177 --> 00:07:57,168
Oh, letter this morning from Sally.

8
00:07:57,246 --> 00:07:59,271
Sam's finished internship.

9
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:01,748
Starts practice next week.

10
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:05,082
Well, he should specialize.
That's the only thing now.

11
00:08:05,154 --> 00:08:08,783
Maybe he just wants to get
the feel of things.

12
00:08:08,858 --> 00:08:11,349
Our little girl's done all right.

13
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:19,967
Something wrong?

14
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,806
That phone call last night?

15
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,309
What about it?

16
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:33,344
I heard you pacing around in the study
afterwards till almost 2:00.

17
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:40,078
Just a crazy prank.
Look, Emily, it was nothing.

18
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,955
<i>Art? It's me again.</i>

19
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:19,427
<i>Arthur?</i>

20
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,995
Look, I don't know
who you are, but...

21
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:26,261
- <i>Charlie Evans!</i>
- Stop saying that.

22
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:29,099
Charlie Evans is dead.
Now I want you to stop this...

23
00:09:29,171 --> 00:09:31,833
or I'll be forced
to call the police.

24
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:35,308
<i>There are two trophies</i>
<i>on the fireplace...</i>

25
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,040
<i>near the tennis team picture.</i>

26
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,207
<i>Pick up the phone</i>
<i>and walk over to them.</i>

27
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,320
<i>Go ahead.</i>
<i>You know the cord will reach.</i>

28
00:09:49,392 --> 00:09:52,884
- <i>Are you there?</i>
- Yes.

29
00:09:52,962 --> 00:09:55,430
<i>In the picture,</i>
<i>you and I are standing...</i>

30
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:58,296
<i>with our arms</i>
<i>around each other's shoulder.</i>

31
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,803
<i>We're both wearing</i>
<i>the same kind of wristwatch.</i>

32
00:10:01,871 --> 00:10:05,307
<i>Remember, we gave them to each other</i>
<i>after winning the doubles at Princeton?</i>

33
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,500
Yes.

34
00:10:06,575 --> 00:10:10,341
<i>Okay. Take</i>
<i>the doubles trophy there...</i>

35
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,347
<i>and turn it over.</i>

36
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:19,386
<i>One edge of the felt is loose.</i>
<i>Pull it back.</i>

37
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:29,427
<i>You scratched it there, down in</i>
<i>the locker room after we won the finals.</i>

38
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,090
<i>Remember?</i>

39
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,101
<i>With your belt buckle.</i>

40
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,670
L...

41
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,674
I had forgotten.

42
00:10:39,742 --> 00:10:42,438
<i>I didn't.</i>

43
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,445
It can't be you.

44
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:47,607
<i>Okay, now. Listen very carefully.</i>

45
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:50,015
- <i>Did you get the address today?</i>
- Yes.

46
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,677
<i>Good.</i>

47
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:54,348
<i>You're to use the name Wilson.</i>

48
00:10:54,423 --> 00:10:58,052
You can't be Charlie.
You just don't come back.

49
00:10:58,127 --> 00:10:59,560
<i>I'm alive!</i>

50
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:03,257
<i>More alive than I've been</i>
<i>in the past 25 years.</i>

51
00:11:03,332 --> 00:11:05,698
<i>You've got to come tomorrow.</i>

52
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:10,838
<i>Listen. If you don't show up,</i>
<i>that's it.</i>

53
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:14,471
<i>Think, for Pete's sake.</i>

54
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:17,637
<i>What have you got now? What?</i>

55
00:11:20,516 --> 00:11:22,347
I don't know.

56
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:25,114
<i>Tomorrow. Just past noon.</i>

57
00:11:25,187 --> 00:11:28,281
<i>Remember, use the name Wilson.</i>

58
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:31,918
L... don't know.

59
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,928
<i>I won't call again, buddy.</i>

60
00:11:40,302 --> 00:11:41,667
Is it that call again?

61
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:49,041
Stop cross-examining me
every time the phone rings.

62
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:51,909
Understand?

63
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,539
Perfectly.

64
00:11:57,586 --> 00:11:59,781
I'm sorry.

65
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:21,042
Excuse me.

66
00:12:24,346 --> 00:12:26,280
You're excused.

67
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,947
Any fever?

68
00:12:33,022 --> 00:12:36,219
No. Just old faithful.

69
00:12:36,292 --> 00:12:39,989
Make an appointment to see
Dr. Hogan tomorrow.

70
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:42,826
I will.

71
00:12:42,898 --> 00:12:44,490
Promise?

72
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,732
Promise. Thank you.

73
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:04,411
Therefore...

74
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,880
in view of the differential...

75
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,884
between your present equity...

76
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:23,062
Between your present equity
and the amount necessary...

77
00:14:23,131 --> 00:14:25,759
for capitalization...

78
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:30,635
we cannot extend the loan
you require.

79
00:14:30,706 --> 00:14:32,640
Should your equity...

80
00:14:43,318 --> 00:14:44,683
Where?

81
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,914
"Should your equity."

82
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,719
Should your equity increase,
do not hesitate to call on us...

83
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,783
for a personal reappraisal,
et cetera, et cetera.

84
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:54,795
Standard closing.

85
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,425
Yes, sir.

86
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:50,181
My name is Wilson.

87
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:55,890
I was told to...

88
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:01,754
I was told to come here.

89
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,627
Look, is this the place,
or isn't it?

90
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,700
They aren't here anymore.

91
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,914
I got it wrote down.

92
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,622
Thank you.

93
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:34,819
Move it! Let's go!

94
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:39,560
Let's go, you bunch of idiots.
Get that beef cut down.

95
00:16:39,634 --> 00:16:44,196
Damn! Get that truck going and
get the meat the hell out of here!

96
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:46,672
What are you gonna do,
take all day?

97
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:49,575
Don't let those hooks fall off!
Let's move it.

98
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:54,040
Okay, Johnny, get us
another truck up here.

99
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,777
Tighten up with it.

100
00:16:55,851 --> 00:16:57,785
Ah, Mr. Wilson.

101
00:16:57,853 --> 00:16:59,718
Let's go on the truck with it.

102
00:16:59,788 --> 00:17:01,255
Surely this isn't...

103
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,790
No, sir. Come with me.

104
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:05,759
Let's go, Frank!
Move that truck off!

105
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:08,261
Come on!
Let's hook it off! Hook off!

106
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:11,629
Don't just stand there.
Move that beef off the line! Let's go!

107
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,998
What are you, a bunch of jerks?

108
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:16,003
Come on! Go! Go!

109
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:18,562
Come on. Cut it down.
Coming in! Coming in!

110
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,108
All right, come on. Move!
Keep moving that beef up.

111
00:17:21,176 --> 00:17:23,007
Cut it down. Let's go.

112
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,679
Would you step in, please, sir?

113
00:18:02,751 --> 00:18:05,151
I'd much prefer to ride in front,
if you don't mind.

114
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm sorry, sir. The customers
are asked to ride in the back.

115
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:17,292
Your hat, sir.
It's only a short ride.

116
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,299
Thank you.

117
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:39,147
We're here, sir.

118
00:18:45,627 --> 00:18:48,255
Would you take the elevator
to your left, sir?

119
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:12,683
Ah, Mr. Wilson.
Will you come this way?

120
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:14,346
Yes.

121
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,220
There will be a short delay. Perhaps
you'd like some tea and a sandwich.

122
00:19:21,296 --> 00:19:23,230
- Thank you.
- Quite all right.

123
00:19:26,434 --> 00:19:28,368
Make yourself comfortable.

124
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:36,143
Here we go.

125
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,972
Pardon me.

126
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,811
Could you tell me
the way out of this building?

127
00:22:57,889 --> 00:22:59,823
Excuse me.

128
00:22:59,891 --> 00:23:01,950
I was wondering if you could...

129
00:23:02,026 --> 00:23:04,893
Excuse me.
I'm trying to find...

130
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:11,460
Excuse me. I'm trying to find
my way out of the building.

131
00:23:11,536 --> 00:23:14,164
I have a gentleman here
who wishes to leave the building.

132
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:18,073
<i>That would be Mr. Wilson. Would you</i>
<i>have him return to Mr. Ruby's office?</i>

133
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,474
<i>Mr. Ruby is waiting for him there.</i>

134
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:23,412
They want you at the end
of the corridor again.

135
00:23:23,481 --> 00:23:25,415
Yes. All right.

136
00:23:34,826 --> 00:23:36,418
Thank you.

137
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,637
Ah, there you are, Mr. Wilson.

138
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,642
Come in. Please.

139
00:23:55,146 --> 00:23:57,080
Would you close the door?

140
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,513
Please, sit down.

141
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:15,957
My name is Ruby.

142
00:24:16,034 --> 00:24:19,902
I've been assigned to go over the
circumstances of your death with you.

143
00:24:19,971 --> 00:24:22,701
- What?
- I know this seems strange to you.

144
00:24:22,774 --> 00:24:26,141
That's why I'm here.
You probably have a lot of questions.

145
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,408
Of course, the subject might appear
indelicate, but most of our clients...

146
00:24:30,481 --> 00:24:33,314
Get this straight.
I am not a client.

147
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:36,876
Oh, precisely, Mr. Wilson.
You are not a client yet.

148
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:44,091
Let me start by explaining
the cost factor involved.

149
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:46,096
To begin with...

150
00:24:46,164 --> 00:24:50,362
the procedure
is a rather complex one.

151
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:53,836
Seems to be your supper.
The chicken looks delicious.

152
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:55,429
No, thank you.

153
00:24:55,506 --> 00:25:00,102
As I was saying, the cost runs
in the neighborhood of $30,000.

154
00:25:00,178 --> 00:25:03,909
I know this seems rather high,
but in addition to...

155
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:07,348
the rather extensive
cosmetic renovation...

156
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,613
by way of plastic surgery for you...

157
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:12,679
CPS has to provide a fresh corpse...

158
00:25:12,757 --> 00:25:14,918
that perfectly matches...

159
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:18,223
your physical dimensions
and medical specifications.

160
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:20,093
CPS?

161
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:21,654
Cadaver Procurement Section.

162
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,430
Sure you don't want this chicken?

163
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:26,868
Absolutely sure.

164
00:25:26,938 --> 00:25:28,872
Oh, pity.

165
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,999
The next step...

166
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:35,011
is the carefully
planned obliteration...

167
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:38,276
of identifiable portions
of the cadaver...

168
00:25:38,349 --> 00:25:40,408
before it is found.

169
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:42,885
Features, dental structure.

170
00:25:42,954 --> 00:25:45,184
Fingerprints.
We can't leave anything to chance.

171
00:25:45,256 --> 00:25:47,383
No, I guess not.

172
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:50,588
Would you mind if...

173
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,295
Please.

174
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:55,525
Thank you.

175
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,902
Now, there is a problem that
the circumstances of your death...

176
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,872
must be simple.

177
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,343
A simple accident, strangely enough,
is costly, Mr. Wilson.

178
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:13,248
The trick lies in obliterating
just so much and no more, so that...

179
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:16,844
an identification still can
be made based on...

180
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:19,355
as I say,
general dimensions...

181
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:23,053
plus a credible
sequence of events.

182
00:26:23,127 --> 00:26:25,186
Witnesses, et cetera.

183
00:26:25,263 --> 00:26:27,663
The whole thing must be
very carefully staged.

184
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:30,064
We guarantee a death of this kind.

185
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:34,127
Excuse me. Delicious!
They have a wonderful way...

186
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:38,733
of baking cheese on it
so that it gets very crispy.

187
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:44,214
Now, there are any number of ways
you can be found. Excuse me.

188
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:47,774
I mean, your body can be found.

189
00:26:47,852 --> 00:26:52,755
The victim of some kind
of machinery, an explosion.

190
00:26:54,225 --> 00:26:55,866
A hunting misadventure.

191
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:02,003
Oh, but I think these
are somewhat too gross for you.

192
00:27:02,073 --> 00:27:06,737
I had thought perhaps
a hotel room fire.

193
00:27:06,811 --> 00:27:10,042
Would you like me to outline
the circumstances?

194
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:11,081
No, thank you.

195
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:15,141
Oh, good. I was hoping
you would agree.

196
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:19,451
No! I mean, I can't be sure.

197
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:21,354
Oh, of course.

198
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:25,486
We can't expect you
to decide all at once.

199
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:30,660
Think it over. There's so much else
to be done, Mr. Wilson...

200
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:33,863
but if I may say so...

201
00:27:33,938 --> 00:27:37,396
death selection may be the most
important decision in your life.

202
00:27:39,944 --> 00:27:42,572
Here are the trust instruments.

203
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:44,580
Mr. Joliffe, Mr. Brown.

204
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:46,741
My colleagues.

205
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,910
Now, this is your revised will...

206
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:52,183
drawn in accordance
with the requirements of the trust.

207
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:55,384
They're all predated, of course,
to save you the trouble.

208
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:57,450
It's standard procedure.

209
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,394
Effective at the time
of your death...

210
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:04,662
the trust provides
for very liberal settlements...

211
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:06,669
on your wife and daughter...

212
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:08,762
and more than sufficient funds...

213
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:12,104
for your financial needs
in your new identity...

214
00:28:12,176 --> 00:28:16,772
from sums assigned to us
as your trustees.

215
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:19,372
Insurance policies...

216
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,884
annuities...

217
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:23,886
real estate.

218
00:28:27,158 --> 00:28:29,092
If you'll sign right here.

219
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:53,848
The staging here is rather
authentic, you'll see.

220
00:28:57,955 --> 00:29:00,685
Of course, the drug made it
easier to manipulate you...

221
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:03,352
into the proper positions
and attitudes.

222
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:05,827
Rest easy, Mr. Wilson.

223
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,400
You did not ravage our girl.

224
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:19,939
Of course, the photography
is not too professional...

225
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,308
but I think it's clear enough.

226
00:29:35,726 --> 00:29:38,718
- So now it's...
- I have a message from Charlie.

227
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,900
He wanted me to tell you
that rebirth is painful.

228
00:29:46,971 --> 00:29:49,235
You were going to say...

229
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:52,742
"So now it's blackmail,"
eh, Mr. Wilson?

230
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:57,008
- What would you call it?
- Just kind of insurance.

231
00:29:57,081 --> 00:30:01,450
Isn't it easier to go forward
when you know you can't go back?

232
00:30:01,518 --> 00:30:03,645
But you knew that, didn't you?

233
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:08,181
The minute you hung up on Charlie
after that first call.

234
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:10,193
Ah, sure you did.

235
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:19,435
You're saying...

236
00:30:22,573 --> 00:30:24,700
I can never go back?

237
00:30:24,775 --> 00:30:27,403
Fact is, you really
don't want to go back.

238
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,143
Sakes, boy, you owe yourself
this thing.

239
00:30:33,217 --> 00:30:36,209
Rebirth. Life again.

240
00:30:36,287 --> 00:30:39,313
Begin again,
all new, all different.

241
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:41,324
The way you always wanted it.

242
00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:43,986
You've got another chance.

243
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:46,757
Heck, nobody's gonna
miss you, are they?

244
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,027
- My wife.
- What are you to her now?

245
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,774
- We get along.
- What does that mean?

246
00:31:01,245 --> 00:31:03,179
There's my daughter.

247
00:31:09,987 --> 00:31:12,581
We don't see much of her, actually.

248
00:31:14,658 --> 00:31:18,219
She lives out west with her husband.

249
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:22,356
She writes now and then...

250
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:26,135
to let us...

251
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:29,705
What are you to her now?

252
00:31:32,276 --> 00:31:35,404
Excuse an old fool prying, son...

253
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,606
but what does it all mean?

254
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:44,353
It can't mean anything now,
anymore.

255
00:31:44,421 --> 00:31:46,616
There's nothing anymore, is there?

256
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,624
Anything at all?

257
00:31:51,695 --> 00:31:56,928
I expect to be president of the bank
before too long.

258
00:31:57,001 --> 00:32:00,459
And I have my boat in the summer.

259
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,598
We have friends.

260
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:05,608
Anything at all?

261
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:14,317
Guess I...

262
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:18,319
never thought much about it before.

263
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:24,754
I leave Emily pretty much alone
to do what she...

264
00:32:30,968 --> 00:32:32,902
We get along, as I said.

265
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,138
We hardly ever quarrel.

266
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:46,541
Not that that's any...

267
00:32:46,617 --> 00:32:48,551
measure of our lives.

268
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:54,457
Frankly...

269
00:32:56,427 --> 00:32:58,793
during the last few years, we...

270
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:02,965
hardly ever...

271
00:33:09,106 --> 00:33:11,040
ever...

272
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:17,079
l... I don't know
why I'm telling you this.

273
00:33:17,147 --> 00:33:19,513
Because you want to.
Go on.

274
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,856
Ever...

275
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,964
ever...

276
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:40,836
show much affection.

277
00:33:46,777 --> 00:33:48,711
But as I said...

278
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,409
Boat.

279
00:34:00,691 --> 00:34:02,283
And...

280
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:08,721
So this is what happens
to the dreams of youth.

281
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:10,767
Go on, son.
Let it out.

282
00:34:10,834 --> 00:34:13,394
Nothing to be ashamed of.

283
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,404
Let it out.

284
00:34:20,177 --> 00:34:22,111
Time for a change.

285
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:27,913
Now, look. They'll both
be well taken care of.

286
00:34:27,985 --> 00:34:30,351
They don't need you,
and you don't need them.

287
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:34,250
You just can't help
each other anymore.

288
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:38,317
Now, look, son.
You know what I'm saying is true.

289
00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:40,329
There's nothing anymore.

290
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,830
What you need now is a good rest.

291
00:34:49,907 --> 00:34:52,137
A few things to be worked out
in the morning...

292
00:34:52,209 --> 00:34:55,838
but my boys will clear those up,
and you needn't worry none.

293
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,572
Your boys?

294
00:35:01,652 --> 00:35:03,586
You're the head of it all?

295
00:35:03,654 --> 00:35:07,385
There never was a struggle in the soul
of a good man that wasn't hard.

296
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:10,221
My papa told me that...

297
00:35:10,294 --> 00:35:12,319
and it's sure enough true.

298
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:15,432
Believe me, son. I know.

299
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:19,968
I believe you.

300
00:35:21,238 --> 00:35:23,172
That's fine.

301
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:35,466
You know, Mr. Wilson, you represent
something of a milestone around here.

302
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:37,530
When the bandages are removed...

303
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:40,542
I think you'll be
more than pleased.

304
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,910
In fact, I expect you to be prancing
around here like a stud bull.

305
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,451
Now, it's gonna take a while,
so try to be patient...

306
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,578
until we get you ready
for the world again.

307
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:54,323
Now, don't do that!

308
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:56,325
You can't talk because
we've extracted all your teeth...

309
00:37:56,393 --> 00:37:59,226
and given you a complete
vocal cord resection.

310
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,594
Give the tissues time
to pull together.

311
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,664
Now, you got a new set
of permanent teeth.

312
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:09,864
In a week, you won't know
the difference. Thank you.

313
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,034
That's what hurts
the most right now.

314
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:15,043
Everything's different.

315
00:38:15,111 --> 00:38:18,672
When the first healing's over, we'll
start conditioning for muscle tone.

316
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,584
Yes, yes. Those too.

317
00:38:22,652 --> 00:38:24,586
Fingerprints.

318
00:38:24,654 --> 00:38:26,588
Even your signature.

319
00:38:27,657 --> 00:38:30,956
Little thing we did with
the tensor ligaments of the hand.

320
00:38:42,806 --> 00:38:47,266
The orbicularis oris started to sag,
so we tightened them with ligatures.

321
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:49,073
Yeah.

322
00:38:49,145 --> 00:38:51,670
Then we worked on the mandible
to square up the bone.

323
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:04,325
Well, I never.

324
00:39:04,394 --> 00:39:07,659
Holy mackerel, I don't know
how you boys do it.

325
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:10,199
Doc, it's a masterpiece.

326
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:12,200
Good work.

327
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:37,421
Easy does it.
You'll be all right, son.

328
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:56,944
Your scars and hematomas will
disappear in a couple of weeks.

329
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:01,742
After several months
of physical conditioning...

330
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:03,752
the process will be complete.

331
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:32,280
My name is Davalo.
I'm your guidance advisor.

332
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:36,580
This is about your future career.

333
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:38,951
I'm afraid I haven't thought
very much about that.

334
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,889
Oh, yes, you have, sir.
Permit me.

335
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:46,622
<i>I want a ball, a big red one.</i>

336
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:48,891
Whoops.

337
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:51,957
I'm afraid we picked this up
a little too early.

338
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,969
Sit down. We recorded
these regressions...

339
00:40:54,037 --> 00:40:58,030
under pentothal
and caffeine sodium benzoate.

340
00:40:58,108 --> 00:41:00,406
At first, there's always
a touch of the infantile...

341
00:41:00,477 --> 00:41:03,469
but later on, we progress
to a more mature...

342
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:06,071
expressional infrastructure.

343
00:41:07,517 --> 00:41:09,451
Ah, here we are.

344
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,052
<i>What would you like</i>
<i>to do most of all?</i>

345
00:41:15,992 --> 00:41:18,017
<i>Of anything in the whole world?</i>

346
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:25,560
<i>I'd like to be</i>
<i>a tennis pro, I guess.</i>

347
00:41:25,635 --> 00:41:30,095
<i>Yes. That's what</i>
<i>I'd like best of all.</i>

348
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:35,068
<i>And suppose you couldn't be?</i>

349
00:41:35,145 --> 00:41:38,581
<i>What else would you choose?</i>

350
00:41:40,683 --> 00:41:46,315
- <i>I guess I'd like to paint stuff.</i>
- <i>Pictures?</i>

351
00:41:46,389 --> 00:41:50,348
<i>Pictures and things.</i>

352
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:55,772
Well, I think the creative wish
pattern is pretty self-evident.

353
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:02,738
You mean, l...
I ought to be a painter?

354
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,109
Exactly!

355
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:14,217
You see, painting allows you
a basic creative outlet...

356
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:18,886
as well as an environment in which
these sublimations will have free vent.

357
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:24,326
Now, let's take a look at the program
we've worked out for you.

358
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,334
Certificates of study.

359
00:42:30,406 --> 00:42:31,896
Abroad.

360
00:42:32,975 --> 00:42:36,467
Notices of first six one-man shows.

361
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:42,376
Your pictures are realistic
in treatment...

362
00:42:42,452 --> 00:42:45,944
but deal with poetic imagery
in choice of subject.

363
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:50,356
Not that I pretend to be
a critic of painting.

364
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,298
These diplomas...

365
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:02,965
from reputable universities...

366
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,803
They can't be forged.

367
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:11,279
I assure you, every item
is bona fide and valid.

368
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:15,350
How could I even approach
such a professional level?

369
00:43:15,418 --> 00:43:20,117
Simple. You are already established
in a position of some dignity.

370
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:25,126
Nothing conspicuous. Just a solid,
mildly successful sort of thing.

371
00:43:25,194 --> 00:43:28,721
You will be supplied
with fresh paintings periodically.

372
00:43:28,798 --> 00:43:32,199
In time, you'll
perfect your own style.

373
00:43:32,268 --> 00:43:34,566
Surreal, primitive,
impressionistic, whatever.

374
00:43:34,637 --> 00:43:38,437
It will be a transition
from this present work.

375
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:43,104
You see, you don't have to
prove anything anymore.

376
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,843
You are accepted.

377
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:52,479
You will be
in your own new dimension.

378
00:43:54,223 --> 00:43:56,191
You're a bachelor.

379
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:58,784
Birth certificate.
The only son...

380
00:43:58,861 --> 00:44:00,886
of deceased parents, and so forth.

381
00:44:00,963 --> 00:44:03,523
In short...

382
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,727
you are alone in the world...

383
00:44:06,802 --> 00:44:10,829
absolved of all responsibility...

384
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:14,104
except to your own interest.

385
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:19,675
Isn't that marvelous?

386
00:44:20,316 --> 00:44:23,752
<i>Your studio is</i>
<i>in Malibu, California.</i>

387
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:28,017
<i>Quite luxurious, very private.</i>

388
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:30,786
<i>You'll make your own adjustment</i>
<i>in your own way...</i>

389
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,090
<i>in your own time.</i>

390
00:44:33,162 --> 00:44:36,325
<i>Oh, you'll be</i>
<i>self-conscious at first.</i>

391
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:38,697
<i>Don't worry.</i>

392
00:44:38,768 --> 00:44:42,033
<i>It will wear off.</i>
<i>And remember, you've got...</i>

393
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:47,474
<i>what almost every middle-aged man</i>
<i>in America would like to have:</i>

394
00:44:47,543 --> 00:44:49,408
<i>Freedom.</i>

395
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,412
<i>Real freedom.</i>

396
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,012
<i>Ah, it's been a pleasure.</i>

397
00:44:57,086 --> 00:44:59,020
Pillow, Mr. Wilson?

398
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:02,790
Yes, thank you.

399
00:45:54,944 --> 00:45:56,969
Tony!

400
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,882
Hey there, you old rascal!

401
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:07,479
Slow down. Where's the fire?

402
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:11,390
Can't wait to get back to them
pretty little models, huh?

403
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,394
Uh-oh, I am late.

404
00:46:13,462 --> 00:46:17,796
If I didn't have to catch a plane,
I'd make you buy me a drink, by God!

405
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,732
See you soon. Got to run.

406
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:25,798
<i>Welcome home, Mr. Wilson.</i>

407
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,469
My name is John.
I've been assigned to help you.

408
00:46:52,735 --> 00:46:54,259
It's very nice.

409
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:56,897
I think you'll be
quite comfortable, sir.

410
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,383
Do you like your studio?

411
00:47:10,052 --> 00:47:12,486
- Yes.
- Perhaps you'd like to freshen up...

412
00:47:12,555 --> 00:47:14,489
and have a drink.

413
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:28,165
Afterward, I'll try to clear up any
point on which you may have curiosity.

414
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:38,502
The bath is through here.

415
00:47:38,581 --> 00:47:40,640
I'll unpack these for you later.

416
00:47:40,716 --> 00:47:42,308
Fine.

417
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,299
How long will you be here?

418
00:47:57,366 --> 00:48:00,460
John, sir.
For as long as you need me.

419
00:48:00,536 --> 00:48:03,232
The company is fully aware
that you may have problems at first...

420
00:48:03,305 --> 00:48:05,330
and will spare no effort
to help you solve them.

421
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:06,807
Thank you.

422
00:48:06,876 --> 00:48:08,343
Yes, sir.

423
00:48:30,332 --> 00:48:31,924
Yes, sir?

424
00:48:33,135 --> 00:48:38,072
I had a curious experience
at the airport.

425
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,937
What was that?

426
00:48:41,243 --> 00:48:45,145
Well, I was accosted by a man
who called me by name.

427
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:49,784
He seemed to know me,
and I'm certain I've never met him.

428
00:48:53,022 --> 00:48:55,718
I suppose it was a mistake
on his part.

429
00:48:55,791 --> 00:48:57,725
So it would appear, sir.

430
00:49:37,666 --> 00:49:40,692
What kind of people live here?

431
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:44,569
Professionals.
Some in business. Some write.

432
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,939
No artists, I hope.

433
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,410
I think you are the only one, sir.

434
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:22,302
If I may suggest, sir...

435
00:50:22,377 --> 00:50:27,076
perhaps you'd like to give a cocktail
party for the immediate neighbors.

436
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,743
Oh, well, l...

437
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,844
I'd better get myself
used to things first.

438
00:50:34,056 --> 00:50:36,183
Later on, maybe.

439
00:50:36,258 --> 00:50:38,192
As you wish, sir.

440
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:50,197
That's very good, sir.

441
00:51:50,265 --> 00:51:51,857
Thank you.

442
00:51:57,306 --> 00:52:01,675
Wouldn't you enjoy meeting
some of the people here, sir?

443
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,644
I told you I'm not ready yet, John.

444
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:07,614
I'll do this in my own way
and in my own time.

445
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:10,376
Of course, sir.

446
00:53:25,794 --> 00:53:27,386
Hello.

447
00:53:37,472 --> 00:53:38,905
Hey, wait.

448
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,943
I'm sorry about back there.

449
00:53:46,682 --> 00:53:49,116
How about if we try it again?

450
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:52,820
Hello.

451
00:53:52,888 --> 00:53:54,321
I'm Nora Marcus.

452
00:53:57,726 --> 00:53:59,489
I'm...

453
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:01,188
Tony Wilson.

454
00:54:05,667 --> 00:54:07,601
- Walk?
- Sure.

455
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:24,846
Ocean, I love you!
You're beautiful!

456
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:27,150
Beautiful!

457
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,925
All that power,
and she's got all the answers.

458
00:54:35,297 --> 00:54:37,094
Got a question!

459
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:55,582
What did you ask?

460
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:57,584
Oh, a tough one.

461
00:54:59,054 --> 00:55:01,215
"Who and what is Tony Wilson?"

462
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:05,793
And what did it say?

463
00:55:09,364 --> 00:55:12,299
It told me to mind my own business.

464
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:32,578
<i>That was my life.</i>
<i>Two boys, ages ten and twelve.</i>

465
00:55:32,654 --> 00:55:36,112
<i>Successful and indulgent husband.</i>

466
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:40,059
<i>A beautiful house,</i>
<i>complete with microwave oven...</i>

467
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:44,155
intercom, station wagon, et cetera.

468
00:55:44,232 --> 00:55:46,166
Ad infinitum.

469
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:56,578
And?

470
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:59,711
I made myself a cup of coffee,
dressed and left.

471
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:02,622
That was four years ago.

472
00:56:02,691 --> 00:56:04,659
You never went back.

473
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:07,320
I've seen them from
time to time, but...

474
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:10,091
it's different now.

475
00:56:10,165 --> 00:56:12,099
Maybe because I'm different.

476
00:56:14,736 --> 00:56:17,102
I don't expect you to understand.

477
00:56:17,172 --> 00:56:19,106
I think I do.

478
00:56:20,408 --> 00:56:21,807
You?

479
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,606
An artist?

480
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:26,510
Why should you understand?

481
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:30,017
You spent your whole life being.

482
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:34,280
You don't know anything
about me, really.

483
00:56:34,356 --> 00:56:36,187
Yes, I do.

484
00:56:37,692 --> 00:56:39,626
It's all right there in your face.

485
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,263
What is?

486
00:56:43,331 --> 00:56:45,265
Now you're fishing.

487
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:46,925
No. Seriously.

488
00:56:49,003 --> 00:56:50,436
This may hurt a little.

489
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:54,241
I agreed to take my chances.

490
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,780
Madam Marcus will read the leaves.

491
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:19,593
What kind of a man is he?

492
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:26,301
There's grace
in the line and color...

493
00:57:26,374 --> 00:57:29,639
but it doesn't emerge pure.

494
00:57:31,045 --> 00:57:34,811
It pushes at the edge of something
still tentative.

495
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:39,084
Unresolved. As if...

496
00:57:40,321 --> 00:57:44,655
somewhere in the man,
there is still a key...

497
00:57:44,726 --> 00:57:46,216
unturned.

498
00:57:49,297 --> 00:57:50,889
That's quite an analysis.

499
00:57:53,568 --> 00:57:55,297
Not really.

500
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:59,807
When you come to think of it,
it sort of fits everybody, doesn't it?

501
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,877
It's very nice here.

502
00:58:17,692 --> 00:58:21,025
The good things always happen
with the rain.

503
00:58:44,786 --> 00:58:47,414
When will I see you again?

504
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:51,084
I'm going to Santa Barbara tomorrow.
There's a kind of gathering.

505
00:58:51,159 --> 00:58:52,592
Can I come?

506
00:58:53,761 --> 00:58:55,456
It's going to be very wild.

507
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:59,330
Maybe that's part of
turning the key.

508
00:59:44,946 --> 00:59:48,746
To the god Pan.
To the gods of this place.

509
00:59:49,817 --> 00:59:52,718
Drink! See ye, ye gods.

510
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:57,681
March down upon this procession
and bless us all!

511
01:00:00,161 --> 01:00:02,459
The Queen of the Wine!

512
01:00:21,916 --> 01:00:23,850
Wine!

513
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:59,051
Wine!
The Queen of the Wine!

514
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,896
Stomp those grapes!

515
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:19,856
Stomp those grapes!

516
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,870
Stomp those grapes!

517
01:03:54,742 --> 01:03:59,008
Now the season ends,
and the old vines are buried deep.

518
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:03,141
Now, in dying,
Bacchus gives us his blood...

519
01:04:03,217 --> 01:04:05,151
so we may be born again...

520
01:04:06,087 --> 01:04:08,248
laughing, laughing.

521
01:04:09,957 --> 01:04:12,790
- Come dance with me.
- Nora, I don't know these people.

522
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:16,819
- I don't think l...
- Don't think me, Tony. Don't.

523
01:04:16,897 --> 01:04:20,560
I came here to feel... to be.

524
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:22,568
I'm dying, and that's the world...

525
01:04:22,636 --> 01:04:24,501
the whole bloody world!

526
01:04:25,473 --> 01:04:28,840
It's not a question of dancing.
I'm not part of this!

527
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:31,503
I'm dying, and that's the world!

528
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:34,241
The whole bloody...

529
01:04:37,118 --> 01:04:38,551
Don't!

530
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:13,486
Come back here!
Get out of there!

531
01:05:13,554 --> 01:05:17,081
Wait a minute. Get your hands off me.
Nora, get out of there!

532
01:05:18,692 --> 01:05:20,626
No, please don't!

533
01:05:27,601 --> 01:05:30,934
Stomp those grapes!

534
01:05:39,713 --> 01:05:41,647
Please!

535
01:05:51,926 --> 01:05:53,359
Kiss me!

536
01:06:04,972 --> 01:06:07,065
Yes. Yes!

537
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:40,156
- Thank you, John.
- Oh, Mr. Wilson.

538
01:07:40,234 --> 01:07:42,828
- May I present Mr. And Mrs. Lloyd?
- How do you do?

539
01:07:42,903 --> 01:07:44,495
- This is your host.
- Pleasure.

540
01:07:44,571 --> 01:07:47,039
- Mr. Filter.
- Pleased to meet you.

541
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:49,371
- How do you do?
- Hello.

542
01:07:49,443 --> 01:07:51,741
You have seen Tony's paintings,
haven't you?

543
01:07:54,248 --> 01:07:55,681
Cheers.

544
01:07:57,051 --> 01:08:00,020
- May I present Mr. Mayberry?
- Nice to meet you.

545
01:08:17,037 --> 01:08:18,470
Peekaboo.

546
01:08:31,485 --> 01:08:35,182
- Honey, please slow down.
- Never!

547
01:08:35,255 --> 01:08:36,722
Never!

548
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:40,419
Come. I'm taking you
to ze Casbah.

549
01:08:55,042 --> 01:08:58,308
As soon as these people leave,
I'm going to attack you.

550
01:08:59,276 --> 01:09:01,744
Why, Mr. Wilson,
you dirty old man.

551
01:09:12,923 --> 01:09:14,356
I really am.

552
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,388
I want you to know that.

553
01:09:18,462 --> 01:09:20,521
I'm counting on it.

554
01:09:20,597 --> 01:09:23,191
Miss Marcus, you shock me.

555
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:27,100
- Please, ease up.
- Why?

556
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:30,571
Because it's not like you.

557
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,801
Oh, I know that.

558
01:09:37,547 --> 01:09:39,879
I'm sorry.

559
01:09:42,986 --> 01:09:46,422
Guess I just needed
the added strength.

560
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:47,923
Well, that's silly.

561
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:51,188
They're all wonderful people.
Just give them a chance.

562
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:53,695
- Okay.
- Give yourself a chance.

563
01:09:54,765 --> 01:09:56,562
- Okay.
- Yes?

564
01:09:58,101 --> 01:10:00,228
I promise. No more.

565
01:10:03,407 --> 01:10:06,934
And I promise to behave myself.

566
01:10:13,116 --> 01:10:15,380
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

567
01:10:19,489 --> 01:10:21,218
I've embarrassed you.

568
01:10:22,292 --> 01:10:23,725
No, you haven't.

569
01:10:27,197 --> 01:10:30,496
I think I love you.

570
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:45,214
You're beautiful!

571
01:10:50,887 --> 01:10:53,754
- You're an ocean.
- Let's go back.

572
01:10:53,824 --> 01:10:57,817
The sooner we get rid of those people,
the sooner we can be together.

573
01:10:57,894 --> 01:11:00,988
- I'm going to hold you to your promise.
- Oh, God. You're evil.

574
01:11:01,064 --> 01:11:02,998
- Yes!
- God, how evil you are.

575
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:08,996
Henry Bushbain, my husband.

576
01:11:09,072 --> 01:11:12,064
- Nice to know you.
- How do you do?

577
01:11:12,142 --> 01:11:15,339
- You're staggering.
- Hank, that's a dirty lie.

578
01:11:15,412 --> 01:11:18,279
Watch out for this character.
He's a lawyer.

579
01:11:18,348 --> 01:11:20,282
Harvard, I want you to know.

580
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,477
- Really? That's a coincidence.
- Hold it!

581
01:11:23,854 --> 01:11:27,483
- Thank you.
- Me too. In fact, me too twice.

582
01:11:27,557 --> 01:11:29,320
Hollow leg again?

583
01:11:29,392 --> 01:11:34,193
Will you listen? At home, he
makes me look like a veritable piker.

584
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:37,965
Henry, you sneaking two-face, you.

585
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:43,533
- Private joke?
- No. I'm sorry.

586
01:11:43,607 --> 01:11:45,905
Come on, Nora.
Let's ditch these two sots.

587
01:11:45,976 --> 01:11:48,069
Help! Rape!

588
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:51,239
- Wait a minute. You can't do that.
- There's no way you'll get away.

589
01:11:51,314 --> 01:11:53,714
You're going to stay right here.

590
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:56,377
That's my woman. Hey!

591
01:11:58,221 --> 01:12:00,314
That's very funny.

592
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,585
What's funny?

593
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:06,095
Is he really a sneaky two-face?

594
01:12:06,163 --> 01:12:07,596
Yes.

595
01:12:09,633 --> 01:12:12,363
There's such a religious climate
out here. Don't you agree?

596
01:12:12,435 --> 01:12:14,027
- I love the climate.
- Yes.

597
01:12:14,104 --> 01:12:16,538
I belong to a special kind of group.

598
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,301
Nothing subversive, I hope.

599
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:22,675
Oh, good heavens, no!
We change sects.

600
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,343
I beg your pardon?

601
01:12:25,415 --> 01:12:29,351
Oh, no, no. Good heavens.
You thought I meant...

602
01:12:29,419 --> 01:12:31,751
"Sects." S-E-C-T-S.

603
01:12:31,821 --> 01:12:34,415
- Oh, sects!
- Yes.

604
01:12:34,491 --> 01:12:35,981
Well, thank God!

605
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:40,388
We change every month.
Right now, we're in Aztec.

606
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:44,957
Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl,
virgin sacrifice and all.

607
01:12:45,035 --> 01:12:48,698
I just love your paintings.
How do you ever do it?

608
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,473
Well, you see...

609
01:12:53,143 --> 01:12:55,771
It all began with a big, red ball.

610
01:13:00,217 --> 01:13:01,650
You see...

611
01:13:02,485 --> 01:13:06,148
I paint naked, Mrs. Filter.

612
01:13:06,223 --> 01:13:09,056
- The only way to get at the truth.
- How interesting.

613
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:12,891
Of course. In this way,
my inner essence is revealed...

614
01:13:12,963 --> 01:13:15,193
and I am presented to the canvas...

615
01:13:15,265 --> 01:13:18,359
in direct relationship
in my primeval state...

616
01:13:19,135 --> 01:13:22,127
without its sociological trappings.

617
01:13:22,205 --> 01:13:23,797
- Watch it!
- Oh, look!

618
01:13:23,873 --> 01:13:25,841
- Take it easy!
- I'm sorry.

619
01:13:25,909 --> 01:13:28,878
- I'm terribly sorry.
- You all right, hon?

620
01:13:31,214 --> 01:13:33,444
- That will never come out.
- I'm terribly sorry.

621
01:13:33,516 --> 01:13:35,882
- Excuse me.
- Look at this mess!

622
01:13:35,952 --> 01:13:38,716
- It's all right, honey.
- May I?

623
01:13:40,423 --> 01:13:43,324
I'm sure it won't stain.
It will all come out.

624
01:13:52,435 --> 01:13:54,665
Hey! You two
heard the one about...

625
01:13:54,738 --> 01:13:56,171
Yes, we have.

626
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:03,345
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

627
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:09,182
Seems like I'm doing
everything wrong lately.

628
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:13,018
Now, don't pout. Mama will
make everything better, okay?

629
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:16,816
Perfect. Say...

630
01:14:16,893 --> 01:14:19,191
I was thinking
about school just before...

631
01:14:19,262 --> 01:14:23,255
and your house at Harvard wasn't,
by any chance, Adams, was it?

632
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,631
- No, not exactly.
- Is anybody hungry?

633
01:14:25,702 --> 01:14:27,135
Yeah, I am.

634
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:30,872
Say, Hank...

635
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,272
Hey, Hank, here.

636
01:14:39,449 --> 01:14:44,011
Actually, I'm not
a Harvard alumnus either.

637
01:14:45,121 --> 01:14:48,750
That is, I used to be.
I'm not anymore.

638
01:14:48,825 --> 01:14:50,759
- Did you resign or something?
- Take it easy.

639
01:14:50,827 --> 01:14:52,556
That's priceless!

640
01:14:52,629 --> 01:14:57,191
No! I did go to Harvard, you see...

641
01:14:57,267 --> 01:14:59,827
and I was an alumnus...

642
01:14:59,903 --> 01:15:04,465
but that was before I became
a painter, and now I'm not anymore.

643
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:06,702
Come on!

644
01:15:06,776 --> 01:15:08,505
<i>Realized hopes we're dashing</i>

645
01:15:08,578 --> 01:15:12,036
<i>Into blue obscurity</i>

646
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:18,451
<i>Resistless, our team sweeps goalward</i>

647
01:15:18,521 --> 01:15:20,989
<i>With the fury of ze blast</i>

648
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:23,719
<i>We'll fight for the name of Harvard</i>

649
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:27,092
<i>Till the last white line is</i>

650
01:15:27,163 --> 01:15:29,563
<i>Passed</i>

651
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,026
That's absolutely wonderful!

652
01:15:34,104 --> 01:15:38,528
Truth is, I just stopped
being an alumnus. Simple.

653
01:15:38,661 --> 01:15:40,754
- Wilson!
- What?

654
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,856
You and I must play golf sometime.

655
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,366
Golf?

656
01:15:47,303 --> 01:15:49,828
Antiochus Wilson playing golf?

657
01:15:53,543 --> 01:15:55,340
Now...

658
01:15:55,411 --> 01:15:57,436
Arthur Hamilton...

659
01:15:59,348 --> 01:16:02,146
Looks as if our host is in orbit.

660
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:08,757
Wait a minute, you guys.

661
01:16:18,401 --> 01:16:20,335
- Put him down.
- Wait a minute.

662
01:16:20,403 --> 01:16:23,895
- Turn him around.
- Hey, listen.

663
01:16:23,973 --> 01:16:28,637
I got a nephew right in Harvard
right now!

664
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,274
- You don't have a nephew.
- What?

665
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:36,213
I don't have a nephew.

666
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:40,150
Okay, correct.

667
01:16:40,223 --> 01:16:42,157
I don't have a nephew...

668
01:16:43,626 --> 01:16:46,220
but he's there, all right.

669
01:16:46,295 --> 01:16:49,321
He's there, all right.

670
01:16:49,398 --> 01:16:50,831
My daughter...

671
01:16:53,236 --> 01:16:55,864
she's married to a doctor...

672
01:16:55,938 --> 01:16:59,169
and maybe by this time,
I'm a grandfather.

673
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:01,603
Believe me.

674
01:17:01,677 --> 01:17:04,305
They'll never drag it out of me.

675
01:17:05,815 --> 01:17:11,185
I'll stand right here
on my constitutional rights.

676
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:13,381
I'm not a grandfather.

677
01:17:13,456 --> 01:17:14,889
L...

678
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:19,220
Why are you all
staring at me like that?

679
01:17:30,139 --> 01:17:32,505
Why are they staring
at me like that?

680
01:17:32,575 --> 01:17:34,008
They know.

681
01:17:35,178 --> 01:17:36,611
They know what?

682
01:17:38,548 --> 01:17:40,140
They're like you.

683
01:17:43,286 --> 01:17:44,878
What do you mean?

684
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:47,279
Reborns.

685
01:17:57,500 --> 01:18:00,469
Shut up!

686
01:18:03,706 --> 01:18:06,470
Shut up, damn you!
Just who the hell...

687
01:18:06,542 --> 01:18:08,942
do you think you are?

688
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:15,907
My God!

689
01:18:25,494 --> 01:18:29,157
Save me. Please!

690
01:18:42,578 --> 01:18:46,344
- Yes?
- <i>It's me, buddy. Now listen to me.</i>

691
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:49,680
- Charlie?
- <i>Look, Arthur...</i>

692
01:18:49,752 --> 01:18:52,778
- <i>Listen to me!</i>
- Is it really you?

693
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:56,951
<i>Of course it is. Do you realize</i>
<i>how dangerous it is, what you're doing?</i>

694
01:18:57,026 --> 01:19:00,894
I've got to get out of here. You
don't know what they're doing to me.

695
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:03,193
<i>Come on, buddy. Calm down.</i>

696
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,928
- I've got to see you.
- <i>That's impossible right now.</i>

697
01:19:06,002 --> 01:19:08,266
- Why?
- <i>It just is!</i>

698
01:19:08,337 --> 01:19:11,329
<i>You've got to get ahold of yourself,</i>
<i>fast. You'll be sorry...</i>

699
01:19:11,407 --> 01:19:14,535
- You know what they did?
- <i>I can't explain, but...</i>

700
01:19:14,610 --> 01:19:17,101
There's this reborn, Nora.

701
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:21,707
<i>She's not one of them.</i>
<i>She works for the company.</i>

702
01:19:21,784 --> 01:19:23,718
- What?
- <i>That's right.</i>

703
01:19:23,786 --> 01:19:25,219
<i>An employee.</i>

704
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:28,723
But l...

705
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,955
Oh, no. She was so...

706
01:19:38,935 --> 01:19:41,699
Why, Charlie? Why?

707
01:19:41,771 --> 01:19:45,298
<i>Your adjustment was bound to be</i>
<i>difficult in the first stages.</i>

708
01:19:45,374 --> 01:19:47,308
<i>Don't you see?</i>
<i>The company simply provided...</i>

709
01:19:47,376 --> 01:19:48,809
An employee.

710
01:19:50,146 --> 01:19:53,172
<i>It means a lot to me personally.</i>
<i>I can't explain...</i>

711
01:19:53,249 --> 01:19:56,412
<i>but we're sort of tied together,</i>
<i>you and me.</i>

712
01:19:56,485 --> 01:19:58,783
<i>We're so close.</i>
<i>Don't throw it away.</i>

713
01:19:58,854 --> 01:20:00,583
- How?
- <i>Trust, please!</i>

714
01:20:00,656 --> 01:20:03,625
<i>Promise to stay put</i>
<i>until we can get someone to you.</i>

715
01:20:03,693 --> 01:20:08,289
<i>You've got to have help right now.</i>
<i>Please, will you stay there?</i>

716
01:20:08,364 --> 01:20:09,797
<i>Please!</i>

717
01:20:50,206 --> 01:20:52,674
- Yes?
- I'm Mr. Wilson.

718
01:20:52,742 --> 01:20:55,734
Come in, please.
I'll tell Mrs. Hamilton you're here.

719
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:23,731
I'm so glad you were able to come.

720
01:22:23,809 --> 01:22:26,539
- Thank you. I didn't mean to barge in.
- Not at all.

721
01:22:27,713 --> 01:22:30,147
It was very kind of you.

722
01:22:30,215 --> 01:22:33,207
I must have sounded strange
over the phone, but...

723
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:35,549
you see, Arthur never mentioned...

724
01:22:35,621 --> 01:22:38,749
I just met your late husband
last year, shortly before...

725
01:22:38,824 --> 01:22:42,123
Yes. Please, sit down.

726
01:23:02,514 --> 01:23:05,711
Mrs. Hamilton, I'm a painter...
an artist, actually.

727
01:23:06,919 --> 01:23:09,387
I admire your husband's watercolors.

728
01:23:09,455 --> 01:23:10,888
Really?

729
01:23:10,956 --> 01:23:15,450
Not that he was professional,
but he did have something.

730
01:23:15,527 --> 01:23:18,655
He mentioned some paintings
in a cupboard out in the garage.

731
01:23:18,731 --> 01:23:21,325
That's the reason l...

732
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,928
Well, I was wondering
if I might pick one up as a memento.

733
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:32,309
I'm sorry, but the garage
has been cleaned out.

734
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:35,271
You threw them away.

735
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:39,841
No, not exactly.

736
01:23:45,557 --> 01:23:47,491
You have a lovely place here.

737
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:49,584
Oh, thank you.

738
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:52,889
- This was the study, wasn't it?
- Yes, it was...

739
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:55,825
How did you know?

740
01:23:57,002 --> 01:24:00,267
Your husband talked
a lot about this house...

741
01:24:01,106 --> 01:24:02,471
about his family.

742
01:24:03,575 --> 01:24:05,509
I'm sorry.

743
01:24:05,577 --> 01:24:08,011
I didn't mean to stir up
painful memories.

744
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:12,440
No, it's not that.
It's just that...

745
01:24:15,554 --> 01:24:18,148
I never knew Arthur
to do that very much.

746
01:24:19,725 --> 01:24:21,158
How do you mean?

747
01:24:23,395 --> 01:24:25,522
- I don't want to bore you.
- No, please.

748
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:29,160
I'd like to know.

749
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:33,295
You see, I knew him
only for a short while.

750
01:24:36,942 --> 01:24:39,376
I'd really like to know.

751
01:24:40,446 --> 01:24:42,573
It's not just curiosity.

752
01:24:44,216 --> 01:24:49,153
We shared an interest in art.

753
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:54,185
The last time I saw him,
I did some sketches.

754
01:24:55,227 --> 01:24:57,161
Now I'd like to do a painting...

755
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:03,533
but all I have are lines... a face.

756
01:25:06,004 --> 01:25:08,029
Posthumous portraiture?

757
01:25:09,842 --> 01:25:11,571
I'm not joking.

758
01:25:12,778 --> 01:25:15,269
No, of course you're not.
I'm sorry.

759
01:25:15,347 --> 01:25:17,577
You've set me quite a task.

760
01:25:20,552 --> 01:25:24,784
He was a quiet man. The thing I most
remember him for were his silences.

761
01:25:24,857 --> 01:25:26,290
It was...

762
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:31,695
as if he were always listening
to something inside...

763
01:25:33,065 --> 01:25:34,498
some voice.

764
01:25:36,034 --> 01:25:40,596
He never talked about it,
so I never knew what it was.

765
01:25:40,672 --> 01:25:42,606
He was a good man...

766
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:49,809
but he lived as if
he were a stranger here.

767
01:25:49,882 --> 01:25:51,816
He never let anything touch him.

768
01:25:51,884 --> 01:25:54,944
He became absorbed in things,
his job mostly.

769
01:25:56,321 --> 01:25:58,255
He worked hard.

770
01:25:59,224 --> 01:26:01,158
He became more detached and...

771
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:06,319
Always a look around his eyes
as if he were...

772
01:26:06,398 --> 01:26:08,332
trying to say something.

773
01:26:11,003 --> 01:26:12,766
I don't know what.

774
01:26:14,273 --> 01:26:17,401
Protest against what
he'd surrendered his life to?

775
01:26:21,647 --> 01:26:23,581
I never knew what he wanted...

776
01:26:26,585 --> 01:26:28,519
and I don't think he ever knew.

777
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:34,726
He fought so hard
for what he'd been taught to want...

778
01:26:34,793 --> 01:26:37,591
and when he got it,
he just grew more and more confused.

779
01:26:37,663 --> 01:26:39,597
The silences grew longer.

780
01:26:43,068 --> 01:26:45,002
We never talked about it.

781
01:26:47,406 --> 01:26:49,340
We lived our lives
in a polite...

782
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:52,743
celibate truce.

783
01:26:54,646 --> 01:26:57,672
Arthur had been dead
a long, long time...

784
01:26:57,749 --> 01:27:00,183
before they found him
in that hotel room.

785
01:27:05,857 --> 01:27:10,157
Well, I guess I can't tell you
much more. Enough?

786
01:27:13,665 --> 01:27:15,098
Yes, it is.

787
01:27:20,305 --> 01:27:22,330
I really should be going.

788
01:27:24,543 --> 01:27:28,570
I hope I've been some help.

789
01:27:36,555 --> 01:27:37,988
Yes, you have.

790
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:42,492
Very much.

791
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:08,681
<i>You said that you wanted a memento.</i>

792
01:28:10,088 --> 01:28:13,649
<i>It won't be a painting, I'm afraid,</i>
<i>but it's all I have.</i>

793
01:28:27,606 --> 01:28:29,972
I'm sorry, Mr. Wilson.

794
01:28:30,042 --> 01:28:31,634
It doesn't matter.

795
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:47,552
- I want to go back.
- Of course, sir.

796
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:50,987
No, I don't mean to California.

797
01:28:52,564 --> 01:28:54,156
To the company.

798
01:28:55,233 --> 01:28:57,167
Start again, all over.

799
01:28:59,905 --> 01:29:02,999
Antiochus Wilson can die,
can't he?

800
01:29:05,944 --> 01:29:07,377
The company.

801
01:29:08,547 --> 01:29:09,980
Is it possible?

802
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:13,943
I think so, sir.

803
01:29:22,027 --> 01:29:23,460
Begin again.

804
01:29:26,788 --> 01:29:28,221
Quite honestly...

805
01:29:29,424 --> 01:29:31,790
I'm not the least bit sorry...

806
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,886
because there were certain mistakes
made in my case...

807
01:29:34,963 --> 01:29:37,761
Of course, but before we go
into all that, let me ask you...

808
01:29:37,832 --> 01:29:42,166
whether you can recommend
and sponsor a new client.

809
01:29:45,373 --> 01:29:46,863
What?

810
01:29:46,941 --> 01:29:48,568
An acquaintance outside...

811
01:29:48,643 --> 01:29:51,612
whom you feel would benefit
by the company's services.

812
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:53,671
You were sponsored
yourself, you know.

813
01:29:55,216 --> 01:29:57,480
Oh, yes, of course.

814
01:29:57,552 --> 01:29:59,782
A business associate, perhaps.
Someone down the street.

815
01:29:59,854 --> 01:30:02,448
You don't have to be intimately
acquainted with a man...

816
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:05,789
to realize he'd be receptive
to the sort of opportunity we offer.

817
01:30:10,131 --> 01:30:13,498
I'm sorry. Right now,
I just can't seem to...

818
01:30:13,568 --> 01:30:17,163
What I mean is,
I'd like to think about it.

819
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:18,830
That's all we ask.

820
01:30:18,907 --> 01:30:23,469
As you can imagine, our business
is acquired through present clients.

821
01:30:23,545 --> 01:30:26,173
It's a word-of-mouth operation.

822
01:30:26,247 --> 01:30:29,739
You don't suppose we can advertise
in magazines and newspapers.

823
01:30:31,286 --> 01:30:32,947
No, of course not.

824
01:30:34,389 --> 01:30:36,857
I think you'll come up
with something.

825
01:30:38,293 --> 01:30:40,056
Hold it. Thank you.

826
01:30:40,128 --> 01:30:41,755
Hold your arm up, please.

827
01:30:41,830 --> 01:30:44,162
- Excuse me. I don't understand.
- That's it.

828
01:30:44,232 --> 01:30:47,395
- Is all this really necessary?
- 131/2. Profile.

829
01:30:47,469 --> 01:30:50,870
- Turn sideways.
- Is this necessary for...

830
01:30:50,939 --> 01:30:52,497
Hold it.

831
01:30:52,574 --> 01:30:54,599
That's it. Back view.

832
01:30:54,676 --> 01:30:58,168
- What is this, preliminary for surgery?
- Certainly.

833
01:30:58,246 --> 01:31:01,044
Ayear's gone by. A lot happens
to the human body in a year.

834
01:31:07,989 --> 01:31:09,923
This one is yours, sir.

835
01:32:25,834 --> 01:32:27,267
Hello, Arthur.

836
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:33,373
- I don't believe I know you.
- It's me, buddy.

837
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:47,320
You're Charlie?

838
01:32:47,388 --> 01:32:49,185
Guess I am, old buddy.

839
01:32:51,826 --> 01:32:54,351
What are you doing here?

840
01:32:55,296 --> 01:32:57,264
Same as yourself. Waiting.

841
01:32:59,334 --> 01:33:00,767
What's the matter?

842
01:33:03,238 --> 01:33:05,035
Oh, nothing.

843
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:11,571
It's just that it's hard
to recognize somebody...

844
01:33:13,915 --> 01:33:17,180
and not recognize them
at the same time.

845
01:33:18,219 --> 01:33:20,153
How long have you been here?

846
01:33:21,656 --> 01:33:23,647
A while.

847
01:33:26,895 --> 01:33:28,829
When you phoned me, you were here?

848
01:33:30,331 --> 01:33:31,730
Even the first time?

849
01:33:33,001 --> 01:33:34,434
But you sounded...

850
01:33:36,571 --> 01:33:39,005
like the whole thing
was something tremendous...

851
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:42,736
this rebirth, everything...

852
01:33:42,810 --> 01:33:44,744
even when you hadn't
made a go of it!

853
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:54,786
I thought you'd have
a better chance.

854
01:33:54,856 --> 01:33:58,417
Good God! How long does a man
have to wait to get into surgery?

855
01:33:58,493 --> 01:34:00,017
Not long, usually.

856
01:34:01,596 --> 01:34:05,828
I had to stay around and
telephone you, if necessary...

857
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:09,301
through your first adjustment,
but now...

858
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:14,433
That's what you meant
about our being tied together.

859
01:34:18,379 --> 01:34:20,313
I couldn't help it.

860
01:34:22,116 --> 01:34:26,382
I had to find out
where I went wrong.

861
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:33,254
The years I've spent...

862
01:34:33,328 --> 01:34:37,890
trying to get all the things
I was told were important...

863
01:34:38,833 --> 01:34:40,892
that I was supposed to want!

864
01:34:41,970 --> 01:34:43,403
Things!

865
01:34:44,606 --> 01:34:47,302
Not people...

866
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,343
or meaning.

867
01:34:49,410 --> 01:34:51,640
Just things.

868
01:34:53,715 --> 01:34:56,616
And California was the same.

869
01:34:56,684 --> 01:35:01,621
They made the same decisions
for me all over again...

870
01:35:01,689 --> 01:35:04,419
and they were
the same things, really.

871
01:35:10,098 --> 01:35:12,658
It's going to be
different from now on.

872
01:35:15,136 --> 01:35:17,161
A new face and a name.

873
01:35:19,140 --> 01:35:21,472
I'll do the rest.

874
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:23,806
I know it's going to be different.

875
01:35:25,813 --> 01:35:27,747
I suppose you do too.

876
01:35:33,921 --> 01:35:35,513
Good morning, gentlemen.

877
01:35:36,524 --> 01:35:38,048
Mr. Carlson, please.

878
01:35:45,099 --> 01:35:47,966
Charlie. You?

879
01:35:52,807 --> 01:35:56,368
- Art, l...
- Mr. Carlson, please.

880
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:07,750
I have the feeling you're
going to make it this time.

881
01:36:14,365 --> 01:36:16,629
I'm sorry to disappoint
the rest of you.

882
01:36:16,701 --> 01:36:18,134
Perhaps tomorrow.

883
01:36:27,145 --> 01:36:30,273
You don't seem to understand
our problem.

884
01:36:30,348 --> 01:36:33,681
- I understand it perfectly.
- But you're not cooperating.

885
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:38,017
I've told you over and over again,
I cannot think of anyone.

886
01:36:38,089 --> 01:36:40,717
- I can't believe that.
- I've been shuffled around long enough.

887
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:42,725
I think it's time
I had the opportunity...

888
01:36:42,793 --> 01:36:45,819
to start living
some kind of meaningful existence.

889
01:36:45,897 --> 01:36:50,834
If I did sponsor someone, wouldn't
that delay my trip to surgery...

890
01:36:50,902 --> 01:36:54,201
in the event that I were needed
from time to time, to, say, advise him?

891
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:57,867
No, that's not likely,
not if the selection is a good one.

892
01:36:59,243 --> 01:37:02,838
I'm sorry. I don't seem to be able
to think of a single soul.

893
01:37:02,914 --> 01:37:05,849
- You mean you deliberately won't.
- Have it your way.

894
01:37:08,519 --> 01:37:10,146
Very well.

895
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:13,782
That will be all.
You can go back to the day room.

896
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:25,562
Processing, please.

897
01:37:25,636 --> 01:37:30,300
This is Ruby.
On Wilson, 722...

898
01:37:30,374 --> 01:37:33,104
I think we can go
to the next stage now.

899
01:37:52,296 --> 01:37:53,729
Hello, son.

900
01:37:59,837 --> 01:38:01,270
Oh, sir, l...

901
01:38:04,208 --> 01:38:08,611
You know, I sure hoped you'd make it,
find your dream come true.

902
01:38:09,447 --> 01:38:12,848
- What?
- I said I sure hoped you'd make it...

903
01:38:12,917 --> 01:38:14,851
find your dream come true.

904
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:20,623
I guess...

905
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:24,861
I guess I never had a dream.

906
01:38:24,929 --> 01:38:29,764
Maybe that's it.
That sure might have been it.

907
01:38:32,203 --> 01:38:34,137
If I did have one...

908
01:38:35,873 --> 01:38:40,572
it certainly wasn't
Antiochus Wilson.

909
01:38:45,783 --> 01:38:47,978
This time...

910
01:38:48,052 --> 01:38:51,112
I've got to be allowed, sir,
to make my own decision.

911
01:38:51,188 --> 01:38:52,621
You know, son...

912
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:56,922
when I began this business,
I was a young man with an idea.

913
01:38:56,994 --> 01:39:00,293
I wasn't aiming to make a lot
of money, helping others...

914
01:39:00,364 --> 01:39:02,559
helping them to find
a little happiness.

915
01:39:02,633 --> 01:39:04,658
Heck, not just the rich.

916
01:39:04,735 --> 01:39:06,828
I thought eventually...

917
01:39:06,904 --> 01:39:10,465
I got tremendous comfort in
the thought that, in my small way...

918
01:39:10,541 --> 01:39:13,601
I was waging a battle
against human misery...

919
01:39:13,678 --> 01:39:15,612
and I was too.

920
01:39:15,680 --> 01:39:19,446
Except we do have
a high percentage of failures.

921
01:39:19,517 --> 01:39:22,213
I guess that's to be expected...

922
01:39:22,286 --> 01:39:24,481
but it hurts me.

923
01:39:24,555 --> 01:39:27,922
Some reborns make a go of it.

924
01:39:27,992 --> 01:39:32,019
We're always working to find ways
to improve the system.

925
01:39:32,096 --> 01:39:33,688
Yeah, we make mistakes.

926
01:39:33,764 --> 01:39:36,892
The fact is, when our clients
first started coming back here...

927
01:39:36,967 --> 01:39:40,198
I wanted to chuck the whole thing,
but I couldn't.

928
01:39:40,271 --> 01:39:42,432
The organization
was pretty big by then.

929
01:39:43,107 --> 01:39:44,540
Now...

930
01:39:44,608 --> 01:39:47,771
board of directors,
on a profit-sharing basis.

931
01:39:49,246 --> 01:39:50,941
All those people.

932
01:39:51,015 --> 01:39:55,714
You've no idea what a financial
responsibility it turned into.

933
01:39:55,786 --> 01:39:59,586
Heck, we make mistakes,
but we admit them...

934
01:39:59,657 --> 01:40:01,591
and go forward.

935
01:40:01,659 --> 01:40:03,627
I won't see it in my lifetime...

936
01:40:03,694 --> 01:40:07,323
but some of the younger execs
like Ruby may.

937
01:40:07,398 --> 01:40:09,923
You can call it
wishful thinking, son...

938
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,867
but life is built on wishing.

939
01:40:12,937 --> 01:40:15,371
You've got to just keep
plugging away at them.

940
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:18,306
You can't give up...

941
01:40:18,376 --> 01:40:23,006
and you can't let the mistakes
jeopardize the dream.

942
01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:32,088
Well, here's your transportation.

943
01:40:32,156 --> 01:40:34,090
- What?
- Surgery, sir.

944
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,924
- But I've got to talk to you.
- We're on a tight schedule. Please.

945
01:40:37,995 --> 01:40:40,793
Why, I didn't expect so soon.

946
01:40:40,865 --> 01:40:44,028
It's efficiency.
You're lucky we got a match so quick.

947
01:40:44,101 --> 01:40:47,127
Hop aboard, son. Up there.

948
01:40:47,204 --> 01:40:48,796
The doctors are waiting.

949
01:40:52,476 --> 01:40:55,104
That's just so you won't fall off.

950
01:40:55,179 --> 01:40:58,580
But there's things we have
to talk about. I mean, my identity...

951
01:40:58,649 --> 01:41:00,913
We will later.

952
01:41:00,985 --> 01:41:04,352
Just relax, son.
Everything's going to be just fine.

953
01:41:04,422 --> 01:41:07,414
The thing about doing it on my own.

954
01:41:07,491 --> 01:41:10,187
You see, it's so important...
choice.

955
01:41:11,529 --> 01:41:14,054
You've got to change.
We have to talk about it.

956
01:41:14,131 --> 01:41:16,929
We will.
I'll look into it personally.

957
01:41:19,904 --> 01:41:22,839
Remember, son. We've got to keep
plugging away at the dream.

958
01:41:22,907 --> 01:41:25,967
The mistakes teach us how.
It wasn't wasted. Remember that.

959
01:41:32,383 --> 01:41:34,476
My name is Dr. Morris, sir.

960
01:41:34,552 --> 01:41:38,215
According to our records, you
were reared in the Protestant faith.

961
01:41:38,289 --> 01:41:41,486
Did you convert to any other
during your adjustment?

962
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:45,294
Good, good!

963
01:41:45,362 --> 01:41:49,321
That is, good in the sense
that we have a certain definition.

964
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,631
I am not suggesting
that being a Protestant...

965
01:41:52,703 --> 01:41:55,297
is any better
than being a Catholic or Jew.

966
01:41:55,372 --> 01:41:59,502
As a matter of fact, I am qualified
to care for you in those faiths as well.

967
01:41:59,577 --> 01:42:03,536
I was ordained in each...
a rabbi, priest and minister.

968
01:42:03,614 --> 01:42:07,880
I admit it unusual,
maybe a bit advanced.

969
01:42:07,952 --> 01:42:10,819
Wait a minute.
What's happening?

970
01:42:12,990 --> 01:42:16,983
Well, sir, when we have finished,
you'll go on to the next stage.

971
01:42:17,061 --> 01:42:18,494
I don't mean that!

972
01:42:18,562 --> 01:42:21,793
Ultimately, we'll be called
to face the Creator...

973
01:42:21,866 --> 01:42:24,096
and render up our last account.

974
01:42:24,168 --> 01:42:25,829
It happens to all of us.

975
01:42:25,903 --> 01:42:28,701
That's no answer!
What's happening to me now?

976
01:42:28,772 --> 01:42:30,364
Don't shout! Please!

977
01:42:41,345 --> 01:42:44,007
"Blessed shalt thou be coming in...

978
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:47,608
and blessed shalt
thou be in going out.

979
01:42:47,685 --> 01:42:50,552
And He said,
'Thou canst not see My face...

980
01:42:51,622 --> 01:42:55,524
for no man can see Me and live."'

981
01:43:08,906 --> 01:43:12,569
"I am the Resurrection and the Life.
He that believeth in Me...

982
01:43:12,643 --> 01:43:16,909
though he were dead,
shall yet he live.

983
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:21,144
And a stranger shalt thou not oppress,
seeing ye yourselves were strangers."

984
01:43:25,322 --> 01:43:28,052
"He that loveth life shall lose it...

985
01:43:28,125 --> 01:43:33,062
and he that hateth his life in this
world shall keep it unto life eternal.

986
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:36,531
Fear not thou them
which kill the body."

987
01:43:43,073 --> 01:43:45,041
"I am the door.

988
01:43:45,109 --> 01:43:48,909
By Me, if any man enter in,
shall he be saved."

989
01:44:03,127 --> 01:44:04,719
God be with you, sir.

990
01:44:09,399 --> 01:44:10,991
What's his data?

991
01:44:11,068 --> 01:44:15,596
"Wilson, mesomorph, age 51,
no current diseases.

992
01:44:15,672 --> 01:44:18,163
Requisitioned from
day-room stock May 6.

993
01:44:18,242 --> 01:44:22,542
Released for cadaver use last night.
CPS number 722.

994
01:44:22,613 --> 01:44:26,105
Disposition:
Death by automobile accident...

995
01:44:26,183 --> 01:44:28,515
caused by cerebral hemorrhage."

996
01:44:28,585 --> 01:44:30,519
All right. Acid etch.

997
01:44:30,587 --> 01:44:32,020
Yes, sir.

998
01:44:35,692 --> 01:44:39,093
- What's the solution strength?
- 5% at 10 cc's.

999
01:44:39,163 --> 01:44:40,596
Timer.

1000
01:44:41,532 --> 01:44:42,965
Five minutes.

1001
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,874
You were my best work.

1002
01:44:55,846 --> 01:44:58,076
I'm sorry it all
has to end like this.

1003
01:45:02,019 --> 01:45:03,452
Set him up.

1004
01:45:11,929 --> 01:45:14,727
I think we'll put the hemorrhage
right under the left exoccipital...

1005
01:45:14,798 --> 01:45:16,732
in the lingual gyrus.

1006
01:45:18,869 --> 01:45:20,803
Put that light over here.

1007
01:45:21,839 --> 01:45:22,771
Good.

1008
01:45:24,508 --> 01:45:25,941
All right.

1009
01:45:29,947 --> 01:45:32,040
Relax, old friend.

1010
01:45:35,586 --> 01:45:37,019
Cranial drill.
