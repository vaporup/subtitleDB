1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,632
Ask Wong to come in.

2
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,152
Feeling better?

3
00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:08,636
Mr Wong, Dr Sun would like you
to help him.

4
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:11,153
- Where is he?
- He's in the reception hall.

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,635
OK, lead the way.

6
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:05,229
He said thank you. He's never seen
anything like this. He's amazed.

7
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:07,787
Not at all, saving lives
is what matters.

8
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,349
- What's happening?
- Aunt Yee, don't! Stay with me.

9
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,395
I won't leave you.

10
00:02:41,559 --> 00:02:42,878
The children!

11
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:50,073
Watch out, Mr Luke. Get down.

12
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,917
The army have closed Telegraph House.
We've lost contact with Hong Kong.

13
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,229
Are we still going ahead
with our plans?

14
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,028
It's too risky.
We'd better lay low for now.

15
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,316
Let's split up and tell the others.

16
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:27,472
The telex at the consulate
is the only way we can contact them.

17
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:29,915
Mr Luke, you know
how to send a telex.

18
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:33,116
Stay here and keep contact
with the outside world.

19
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,750
- Sun, I...
- I've taken care of your family.

20
00:03:36,839 --> 00:03:39,990
I'll go back to the villa now,
and then go on to the wedding.

21
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,274
If you don't get a message from me...

22
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:45,352
take the boat to Hong Kong
tomorrow morning.

23
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:51,508
Don't be late.
Take my watch with you.

24
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,797
If I fail...

25
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:57,436
carry on the fight.

26
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,997
I will.

27
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:09,989
- Dr Sun, are you leaving?
- I've got something to do.

28
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:11,797
- I'll see you out.
- Thank you.

29
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,229
- Stay here.
- Be careful, Fei-hung.

30
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:19,358
The White Lotus Sect will drive
the foreigners out!

31
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:24,789
Dr Sun, how will you get out?

32
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,673
It's easier to save men
than their country.

33
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,876
It seems my medical case and I
can't save them all.

34
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,157
Get them out of here!

35
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,111
Get out of here! Go!

36
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,075
See you later, Master Wong.

37
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,193
Sir, we just want
to expel the foreigners.

38
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,349
We wouldn't kill our own people.

39
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,636
I'm glad to hear it.
Leave the negotiating to us.

40
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,155
If you were so capable,
we wouldn't have lost so much land.

41
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,957
It's all your fault!

42
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:10,711
If you continue to make trouble,
I'll arrest you all.

43
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,950
- Take the altar away.
- Yes, sir.

44
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,392
General Lan is here, make way.

45
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,629
I see Mr Luke is hiding here as well.

46
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,314
Mr Luke.

47
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,758
- Let's go!
- Yes, sir.

48
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,111
- Sam Fok.
- Sir?

49
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,678
Cut the wire pole down.

50
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:25,354
I want to stop all communications.

51
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:30,272
An army without information
is a dead army.

52
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,398
As soldiers we are men of the world.
We must do what is best.

53
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:36,468
Sir...

54
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:40,029
- I know. Just follow my orders.
- Yes, sir.

55
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,716
Carry out the General's instructions.
Go on.

56
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,310
The British are trying to divide us.

57
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,959
Pick up the altar!

58
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,314
Let's go.

59
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:41,392
If you are all up for this,
let's practise some kung fu.

60
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,272
Once you have your stance, don't
move. This is the Hanging Horse.

61
00:07:46,359 --> 00:07:49,157
One move and you're steady as a rock.

62
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,272
This stance brings unlimited power.
Perform the Unicorn Move.

63
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,674
Third move...

64
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,035
Hold the head, grab the hand, twist!

65
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:03,317
Watch carefully!
Return to your original position.

66
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,758
And again!

67
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,598
Not bad. Hold that stance
for two hours.

68
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,669
Foon!

69
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:16,994
Hold the head, grab the hand,
then twist... what do you do with it?

70
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,512
Grappling Hand?

71
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,750
Yes, I've learned it,
but I don't know how to use it.

72
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,276
That's easy. I'll attack
and you counter attack.

73
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:26,587
- Watch.
- OK.

74
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,593
Is it this way?
It doesn't feel right.

75
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,194
Foon, what are you doing?
Why are you holding Aunt Yee?

76
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,749
- I'm teaching her Grappling Hand.
- You teach her?

77
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,557
Do you think I can't teach her?

78
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,154
It's not right for you
to hold Aunt Yee. Knee bends, now!

79
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:53,358
- Master, I...
- Now!

80
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:00,395
Stop looking at me.

81
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:02,198
Carry on!

82
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:07,637
I'm going, Master.

83
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,512
What are you doing?

84
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:14,510
The stance.

85
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:16,078
That's not the way!

86
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,756
Fei-hung, don't be angry with Foon,
I asked him to teach me.

87
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,272
You did?

88
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,155
Why don't you ask him to come back?

89
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,916
Go on, then.

90
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:44,439
I'm punished for this? What would
happen if I taught her the Bear Hug?

91
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,676
These foreigners are really lazy!

92
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,193
If White Lotus came,
you'd be a goner.

93
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,712
Trying to scare me?

94
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:44,078
Wait for her to come down.

95
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:48,798
Mr Luke.

96
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,316
Have you seen Foon?

97
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,517
- White Lotus?!
- Help!

98
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,037
White Lotus is here!

99
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:30,354
They're here!

100
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:39,829
Wind and fire come together.
Kill all foreigners.

101
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,515
White Lotus, saviour of the world.
Eradicate all evil!

102
00:11:43,599 --> 00:11:46,591
Go and hide and don't come out.
I'll be right back.

103
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,908
OK, come back soon.

104
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,232
Come on, come on.

105
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,793
- Who is that? Mr Luke?
- Yes.

106
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,278
- Upstairs.
- You go first.

107
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:13,788
- General...
- Be quiet.

108
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:24,029
Now you'll die, you little brats!

109
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,833
The stance!

110
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,589
Foon, tie them up.
I'll see if there are any left.

111
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,870
- Arrest them, go!
- Yes, sir.

112
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,551
Arrest the White Lotus.

113
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,513
Leave!

114
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,757
- What are you looking at?
- They are fighting.

115
00:15:30,119 --> 00:15:32,873
Fei-hung, General Lan
killed the consul!

116
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,274
Don't move!

117
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,270
- Search everywhere!
- Yes, sir.

118
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,753
Nothing over here.

119
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,074
- Tell Sun to run for his life.
- OK.

120
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,874
I know you look on me as your aunt...

121
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,914
but you're the one for me
in my heart.

122
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,596
If we lose each other...
come and find me.

123
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,598
It's time to go.

124
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,109
Whatever happens,
we must survive this night...

125
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,069
so that future generations
can see a new dawn.

126
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,832
Do you understand?

127
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,674
Foon, you pretend to be Mr Luke
and distract the soldiers.

128
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,437
If you can, find the name-book
in the market for Mr Luke.

129
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,475
I will.

130
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,030
Leung Foon, take this watch.
Meet me at the pier at seven am.

131
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,356
It's down to you now.

132
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,792
Siu-qun.

133
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,388
You said my name!
It's the first time you've done that.

134
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,038
Who are you?

135
00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:52,713
I'm the interpreter
from the consulate, sir.

136
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:55,431
Go on, then.

137
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:01,157
Foon, go now.

138
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:11,034
Mr Luke! Mr Luke!

139
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,471
- Mr Luke?!
- After him!

140
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,993
- General.
- Wong Fei-hung.

141
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:26,392
Sir, I want to destroy their leader.
That way I destroy the whole sect.

142
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,798
And who's that?

143
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,871
Foon, come and meet the General.

144
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,994
Sir.

145
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,230
He was injured by the White Lotus.

146
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,675
Sir, we can't predict
what might happen.

147
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,512
Please take care of the children.

148
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,590
OK, I promise you.

149
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,794
Thank you.

150
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,752
- Escort Master Wong to the temple.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,118
White Lotus, I want to join you.

152
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,592
The White Lotus Sect welcomes you,
our guests.

153
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:34,989
Master Wong, there are so many
soldiers, how can we escape?

154
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:39,038
The temple is so big, we can just
disappear. I'm sure we can get out.

155
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,431
Under the incense,
long live the White Lotus Sect.

156
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,396
Is it safe in there?

157
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,074
Don't worry, just relax.

158
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:54,433
- Anyway, we can't go back now.
- Let's go in, then.

159
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,108
The Goddess comes to save all people.
White Lotus will free the poor.

160
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:08,829
Our sect brings peace to the world.
Prepare for our initiates.

161
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:10,797
Kneel!

162
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,188
Wong Fei-hung, Leung Foon,
come to the altar.

163
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,513
Come forward to be purified.

164
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,829
Let the ceremony begin.

165
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,709
Swallow the lucky token,
become a child of the sect.

166
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:43,278
We are all brothers.

167
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,829
We share a common bond -
for better or for worse,

168
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,387
for richer or for poorer -
all are equal.

169
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,393
Drink this
and you'll be a member forever.

170
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,789
May lightning strike down
all those who betray us.

171
00:20:58,879 --> 00:20:59,994
Master!

172
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,673
Be loyal before God. Drink it!

173
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,155
God in heaven, devils below.

174
00:21:17,239 --> 00:21:19,594
Protected by God,
nothing can harm me -

175
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,557
A thousand knives are deflected.
A million blades are deflected.

176
00:21:25,959 --> 00:21:28,757
The body is now as strong as iron.

177
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,432
Nothing can penetrate!

178
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,554
Master Wong!

179
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,032
Kill him now!

180
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,397
Seek the power within!

181
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:56,752
Wong Fei-hung,
how dare you make trouble here!

182
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,070
Priest Gao Kung's name is famous.

183
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,710
But I need to see him
before joining the sect.

184
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:06,751
I need to see him now!

185
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,235
We won't let you see
his righteousness!

186
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,593
You won't?

187
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,433
I'll fight my way in, then!

188
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,837
"White Lotus"

189
00:22:19,999 --> 00:22:20,989
How dare you!

190
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:22,114
Leave here.

191
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,833
Surround him!

192
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,275
You'll have to look out for yourself.

193
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,070
Sky, wind, earth, fire,
eight stances to challenge you!

194
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:40,911
Surround him!

195
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,958
You're all frauds!

196
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,312
That's enough.

197
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:05,107
God...

198
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:12,951
It's all a deception!

199
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,790
God will protect us.

200
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,194
Gao Kung, why don't you come out?

201
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,516
This whole thing is a fraud.
I want to reveal the truth.

202
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,356
Protect the altar!

203
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,353
White Lotus brothers, kill him!

204
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:03,156
Come and fight me if you dare!

205
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,633
God will protect us.

206
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,109
Stop, or I'll shoot!

207
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,797
Can't you see this idol
cannot protect you?

208
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:19,712
You must stop believing in it.

209
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,070
- You...
- Mr Luke!

210
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,310
Come this way
and we'll see who doesn't die.

211
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,151
Let me through!

212
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,753
God will protect me.
Your gun doesn't scare me!

213
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,388
God will protect you!
The body is as strong as iron!

214
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:44,279
Little girl, you will lose your life.
Get back!

215
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:50,507
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

216
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:53,914
Let's go, quick!

217
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:57,992
I've shot the girl!

218
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,309
Don't worry about that now.
You first.

219
00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:13,869
- Stay there!
- Look at these people.

220
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,312
They're giving up their lives
for this idol.

221
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,071
Mr Luke, let's go!

222
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,511
If they're all like that,
how will they ever change?

223
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:25,989
They know nothing else.

224
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,110
Surround them!

225
00:25:38,879 --> 00:25:43,395
There's nowhere to run to.
We can't escape.

226
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,754
Don't let them get away!

227
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:10,874
Beloved God, take over my body.

228
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:16,031
God will protect my body giving me
power to exorcise the evil spirits.

229
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:26,474
With God in my body,
I'll teach you the true way.

230
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,349
How dare you wake me to come here,
you fools!

231
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:38,036
Anger the gods and bring them
to earth. I'll teach you!

232
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,749
Come out, or I'll burn my own altar.

233
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:47,875
Gao Kung, the righteous, is here.

234
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,637
Welcome High Priest Gao Kung.

235
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,789
The invincible Gao Kung!

236
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,869
The universe is controlled by him!
All things obey his command.

237
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,667
The Goddess personally taught me.

238
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:41,389
She instructed me to set up an altar
to exorcise the evil spirits

239
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,789
and save us from this impure world.

240
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:45,949
Come spirit!

241
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,114
Come, spirit!

242
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,076
Here I come!

243
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,991
Come down here!

244
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,114
Be gone!

245
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:01,998
Trap him! Come on!

246
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,432
Yes, sir!

247
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,115
- Why do you need help?
- I'll do what it takes!

248
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,034
Come down!

249
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:28,558
Steady!

250
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:31,712
Yes, sir!

251
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,993
You set up a useless altar.
Come up here!

252
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,151
Supreme Being, come into my body!

253
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:42,715
I'll leave this broken altar for you.

254
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:49,391
Steady, steady!

255
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,552
How dare you!

256
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:56,835
How dare you wreck my altar!

257
00:29:57,759 --> 00:29:59,397
Protect Priest Kung.

258
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,757
Use the cloth as an altar.

259
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:10,557
Do you want to die?

260
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,036
Supreme Being, four Guardians
of Heaven, come to my aid.

261
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,110
Destroy my enemy.

262
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,633
Guardian of Anger!

263
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:22,028
Guardian of Mercy!

264
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,679
Guardian of Evil!

265
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,355
Little girl.

266
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,159
Guardian of Defiance! Come!

267
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,833
Gao Kung, you've summoned all
the guardians! Are you ready yet?

268
00:30:36,239 --> 00:30:39,391
If any guardian was of use,
one would be enough.

269
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,351
They will all punish you!

270
00:30:59,199 --> 00:31:01,076
Death to you, the guardian's enemy!

271
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:08,792
Die now!

272
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,632
Wind somersault!

273
00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,676
Mighty strike!

274
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:27,397
Evil being!

275
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,071
Priest Kung is invincible.
He will exorcise all evil!

276
00:31:36,999 --> 00:31:38,592
Get down!

277
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,352
No Shadow Kick from Fushan!

278
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:46,357
Protect Gao Kung!

279
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,112
Killer Cloth!

280
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,315
I am not any sort of god.
I'm Wong Fei-hung!

281
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,674
Can't you tell gods from what is not?

282
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:12,355
Wong Fei-hung, prepare to die!

283
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,236
White Lotus opens up!

284
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,837
Put your feet on the ground.

285
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:33,038
It's all a deception.

286
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,232
Wong Fei-hung,
how dare you challenge the gods!

287
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,914
Gods don't burn!

288
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:43,230
If that's true,
there's no justice.

289
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,836
Solar explosion!

290
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,592
Gao Kung.

291
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:09,070
Your show is over now.

292
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,793
You demon!

293
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:15,393
You say believe in God
and peace will reign.

294
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,835
How many people have you killed?
Let's see you survive this!

295
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:29,593
- Nobody can stop me!
- I can.

296
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,197
Claw Knife!

297
00:33:58,719 --> 00:34:00,277
A metal plate!

298
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:02,395
His magical powers amount to this.

299
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:07,795
Now they've no god,
they must look after themselves.

300
00:34:08,759 --> 00:34:12,958
- God!
- Master!

301
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,475
How can this happen?

302
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,518
Let's go.

303
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,476
What kind of number...?

304
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,154
I can't even read it,
this is no use to me.

305
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,233
Master.

306
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,949
Good, we meet again.

307
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:45,190
It's six o'clock,
there's still time.

308
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,917
Hey, where is the name-book?

309
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,193
Name-book?

310
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:51,989
Oh, no! I was distracted
by the soldiers and forgot it!

311
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,956
Why are you so careless?!

312
00:34:54,039 --> 00:34:54,994
I'll go back and get it.

313
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,558
Do we have enough time?

314
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,278
I must get it,
it's a matter of life and death.

315
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,952
Let's go.

316
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:06,797
"Gatehouse"

317
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:10,557
Mr Luke, it's well-guarded,
do we have to go in?

318
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,518
I must get the name-book.
The boat leaves in 30 minutes.

319
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,954
We can't be late
meeting Sun at the pier.

320
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:21,392
Wait there.

321
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:36,068
- Foon, see if Mr Luke is ready yet.
- OK.

322
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,638
I'll keep watch.

323
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,227
- Mr Luke, can I help?
- I've got it, let's go.

324
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,038
Soldiers, let's hide.

325
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:53,507
Search the building.

326
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,596
Master Wong, this way.

327
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:01,118
Hurry!

328
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,952
I'm going to die this time.

329
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,074
Help him up.

330
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,909
Where are you hurt?

331
00:36:11,999 --> 00:36:14,593
It hurts, it really hurts.

332
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:19,951
Luckily they shot your watch...

333
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:25,513
Mr Luke!

334
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,998
You bastards!

335
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,998
Foon, you go first.

336
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:38,592
Mr Luke, I'll carry you.

337
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,512
This way, Master.

338
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,070
Don't move!

339
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,272
Master, there's a way out.

340
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,108
Let's go.

341
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,514
- Are you all right?
- I can't go on. Leave me here.

342
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,038
Let me help you.

343
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,269
The name-book is vitally important.

344
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,951
Don't let the Government have it or
many Chinese people will be killed.

345
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:28,678
Take me over there.

346
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,673
You can't burn this cloth.

347
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,592
Master Wong, I beg you,
deliver this to Sun personally.

348
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:48,311
Tell him I died for the revolution.
He must live for the revolution.

349
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,469
There's blood here.
They're over there!

350
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,231
Foon, look after Mr Luke.

351
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,558
General Lan?

352
00:38:12,799 --> 00:38:14,517
We meet again.

353
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,435
- Arrest the rebels!
- Yes, sir!

354
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,315
Hold it. What are you burning?

355
00:38:23,279 --> 00:38:26,989
Wong Fei-hung, this will be
our last chance to spar.

356
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,068
I wonder how many of my moves
you can withstand.

357
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,477
Give me that now!

358
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,514
Here you are!

359
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,873
How dare you!

360
00:39:09,759 --> 00:39:11,159
The name-book?

361
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,078
Foon, stay where you are.
Carry on with what you're doing.

362
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:21,714
Master, take care.

363
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,788
Lan, didn't you want to test me?

364
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:48,871
Wong Fei-hung!

365
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:54,353
Come on, then!

366
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:01,998
Come down!

367
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,273
You come up!

368
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,153
Come down!

369
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:16,032
You wanted to fight?

370
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,236
Son-of-a-bitch! This is too much!

371
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,309
Why aren't you down yet?

372
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:26,592
Mr Luke!

373
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,318
Time...

374
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,038
is vital.

375
00:40:33,919 --> 00:40:36,911
Be on time... at the pier.

376
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:39,950
Meet Sun Yat-sen.

377
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,278
Mr Luke!

378
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,512
Mr Luke.

379
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,397
Wong Fei-hung, there's no way out!
Come back.

380
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,909
You killed the British consul,
everyone will know sooner or later.

381
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,075
There's no way out for you either.

382
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,711
Well... we're both doomed, then.

383
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:02,397
Foon, you can't burn that cloth!

384
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,556
- Master!
- Foon, go quickly. Time is vital.

385
00:43:52,879 --> 00:43:55,393
It's a dead end, there's no way out.

386
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:05,391
Foon, what time is it now?

387
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,588
I can't tell the time,
but it's getting light.

388
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:27,310
There's not much time left.

389
00:44:29,279 --> 00:44:31,713
Mr Sun must meet Mr Luke
before he sails.

390
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,950
Wong Fei-hung.

391
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,711
Please give me the name-book
so I can go back to the Governor.

392
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,752
He won't let us go.
Try and find a way out.

393
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:16,313
Quick! go!

394
00:45:17,999 --> 00:45:19,557
Cloth Staff!

395
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:23,592
Foon, make the hole bigger.

396
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,518
Well done!

397
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:55,154
Thank you.

398
00:46:00,679 --> 00:46:03,318
- Foon, get out of here.
- Yes, Master.

399
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:18,237
- Master, we can go now.
- Yes, you can go to hell!

400
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,708
Foon!

401
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:29,876
No Shadow Kick!

402
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:18,351
Master.

403
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,998
All aboard! Hurry up, everyone!
All aboard!

404
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,556
- Where's Mr Sun?
- Hurry up.

405
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,231
We've found him.

406
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:46,875
Don't move! You're coming with me.

407
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,833
Out of the way!

408
00:47:51,919 --> 00:47:54,513
Grab the hand, crouch down and twist.

409
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,199
Master.

410
00:48:08,279 --> 00:48:09,553
Fei-hung!

411
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:11,954
Aunt Yee!

412
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,592
Where is Mr Luke?

413
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,318
Dr Sun!

414
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,272
May a new dawn break
over our land.

415
00:48:41,319 --> 00:48:44,311
May we never forget
our martyrs' blood.

416
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:52,507
Mr Luke, your spirit will always be
remembered in our hearts.

417
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,477
Don't worry, I'll meet
you at the pier!

418
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,079
Foon, are you missing Aunt Yee?

419
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,192
Are you, Master?

420
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,031
I asked you the question.

421
00:49:41,159 --> 00:49:44,038
I think you're the one
who's missing her.

422
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,711
- Really?
- Yes.

423
