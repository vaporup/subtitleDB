00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:51,476
"Temple of the Goddess"

2
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,034
The King rules heaven

3
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,558
The devil rules hell

4
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,349
Between the two there is White Lotus

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,596
Keeping our country safe

6
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,837
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,753
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

8

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,950
On September the first, 1895,

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,918
I became a disciple
of the White Lotus Goddess.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,468
I speak these words
before the heavens

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,950
to show my powers
and spread my word to the people.

15
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,677
Mystical powers protect me!

16
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,552
Impervious to water and fire!

17
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,349
Goddess, lend me your powers!

18
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,955
Welcome spiritual master, Gao Kung.

19
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,711
Goddess, make me as strong as iron -
fearless before blade or sword.

20
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,074
Stabbing and slicing have no effect.

21
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,719
I'm fearless before cannons
or gunshot!

22
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,188
49 levels of transformation!

23
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,432
Holy Army under my command!

24
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,158
My bones are like pillars
supporting the sky!

25
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,713
The fierce flames
are like dust to me!

26
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:23,715
Unlimited mystical powers
at my disposal!

27
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,031
The White Lotus Sect...
eradicates evil!

28
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,711
A thousand knives are deflected!
A million blades are deflected!

29
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,027
A thousand knives are deflected!
A million blades are deflected!

30
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,552

Mystical power protect me!
Mystical power protect me!

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,394
Cannon fire is as flying sand to me!
Bullets are mere raindrops!

33
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,511
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

34
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,670
Bring out the objects of evil.

35
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,476
What's this animal? It's so ugly!

36
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,117
It's a Western dog, Master!

37
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,430
It has spots, so it is evil, kill it!

38
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,994
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

39
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,435

Steady, Master.

52
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,639
'He doesn't spill a drop
to either side.'

53
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,954
'Good footwork.'

54
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,315
Aunt Yee, the train is rocking
so much, how will we eat?

55
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,187
You're not used to it.
Look, the foreigners are coping fine.

56
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:06,348
Come and sit here.

57
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,194
Now it's much better,
this journey used to take all day.

58
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,430
The trees look like they're flying.

59
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,795
- I feel ill.
- What's wrong, Foon? So much talk!

60
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,869
Nothing...

61
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,394
My stomach is churning.

62
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,074
You're trainsick!
Don't eat or you'll throw up.

63
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,993
But I must! There's Western food
to eat, right, Master?

64
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,033
Excuse me, waiter,
we haven't ordered yet.

65
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,192
You don't need to order your food
on the train.

66
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,509
- Miss, the soup.
- Thank you.

67
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,317
It's all been prepared.

68
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,390
You mean it's not fresh?

69
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,354
- Solar eclipse?
- Don't be so scared, idiot!

70
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,428
Aunt Yee, what's going on?

71
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,918
We're in a tunnel.

72
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,836
A tunnel? The train is strong enough
to go through a mountain?

73
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,998
Amazing!

74
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,717
Idiot!

75
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,878
Foon, we're all together now, but
don't run off when we get to town.

76
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,914
OK.

77
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,754
There will be a lot of foreigners
at the medical convention.

78
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,239
Don't embarrass us.

79
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,072
I understand, Master.

80
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,793
'So many hands!'

81
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,629
Fei-hung, eat the soup
while it's hot.

82
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,278
Foon, eat the soup
while it's hot.

83
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,470
I don't know which hand is mine.

84
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,431
'I can do it that way.'

85
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,636
- Have you finished your soup, sir?
- I'll finish it later.

86
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,073
Only meat? Where's the rice?

87
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,628
Miss, have you finished your soup?

88
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,437
I don't want it.

89
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,592
Thank you.

90
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,352
Fei-hung, it's a steak,
use your knife and fork.

91
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,270
I've seen this before.

92
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,077
You're always doing this.

93
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,038
What a waste! Don't throw it away.

94
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,673
Waste not, want not.

95
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,269
Watch me.

96
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,916
- Are you OK?
- I'll clean your face.

97
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,355
Yes, I'm fine. Here's your steak.

98
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,307
Master, don't throw it away!

99
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,230
It's all your fault.

100
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,197
Forget it, let's eat.

101
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:06,830
Why are you so quiet?

102
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,359
No reason. Why are you so quiet?

103
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,836
Oh, no. I can't hold it any more!

104
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,559
I told you not to eat.

105
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:22,107
Hold on, we'll be in Canton soon.

106
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,235
- Really?
- Yes.

107
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,958
Riding on a train
is quite a challenge.

108
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,078
Waiter, can you pack this?

109
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,197
- What did you say?
- I just don't want to waste it.

110
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,634
Chicken buns!

111
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,991
Give me a pot of tea.

112
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,278
- Old man, you owe me money. Pay up!
- If I can't play, I can't pay.

113
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,595
Look, a crowd. What's on the banners?

114
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,591
- Support the scholar's proposal!
- Support the scholar's proposal!

115
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,467
- We object to the cession of Taiwan!
- We object to the cession of Taiwan!

116
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:56,833
Where is Taiwan?

117
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,558
We lost the war and gave it to Japan.

118
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,077
Taiwan must be near the sea...
or it wouldn't be called Tai-island.

119
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,879
I don't even know how big it is.

120
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,315
We can't even manage Canton,
forget it.

121
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,355
- Let's drink.
- Yes, let's drink.

122
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,236
Eat, we'll talk later.

123
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,552
We object to Li Hung-chang's
concession to Japan!

124
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,552
- We object to the cession of Taiwan!
- We object to the cession of Taiwan!

125
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,916
Look at the clothes on that woman!

126
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,591
- Where?
- Over there.

127
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,399
The one in the rickshaw.
Come and have a look.

128
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,119
She's wearing Western clothes.

129
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,234
Sister?

130
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,553
Let's do the lottery.
Nine is my lucky number.

131
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,833
No, I don't want to.

132
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,229
Support the scholar's proposal!

133
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,869
We object to the treaty
of Shimonoseki!

134
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,475
We object to Li Hung-chang's
concession to Japan!

135
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,756
We object to the cession of Taiwan!

136
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,196
Support the scholar's proposal!

137
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,118
Money first, look after your tickets.
Get your ticket and move on.

138
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,633
The lottery!

139
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,230
Roast pork buns!

140
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:13,908
We're here, sir.

141
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,831
- Ten cents, please.
- Thank you.

142
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,595
Let's eat. Pulling this rickshaw
will be the death of me.

143
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,759
That's a pretty dress.
Can I take a picture?

144
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,990
You're not a foreigner. Get her!

145
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,798
Get her! Get her!

146
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,269
- Come with me.
- Go away, you pesky kids!

147
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,677
Throwing things at people!

148
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,553
No manners!

149
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,517
- Foon!
- Get lost...

150
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,113
Don't hit the children.

151
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,918
I'm bleeding!

152
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,318
Sister!

153
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,630
- Look, you've made trouble again.
- Master...

154
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:50,032
Let's go, we'll tell Uncle Gao.

155
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,796
Those kids are so naughty, throwing
things at people. Look at the mess.

156
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:57,398
Attention, please.

157
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,075
White Lotus are meeting
at Telegraph House. We should all go.

158
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,355
Don't leave! Don't forget to pay!

159
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,629
Master Wong,
I'm going to have a look.

160
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,870
Aunt Yee... Aunt Yee!

161
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,154
Foon! Foon!

162
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,876
Hurry! They're about to start!

163
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,677
Come on, hurry up!

164
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,432
In the name of the people's army
stand down!

165
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,556
Damned soldiers,
working for foreigners! Stone them!

166
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,996
Get out of the way.

167
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:38,158
Move!

168
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:43,467
Wind and fire come together to kill
the foreigners in one fell swoop!

169
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,075
White Lotus has come to save you
by driving evil away!

170
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,394
- Burn down Telegraph House!
- Burn down Telegraph House!

171
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,789
Excuse me, please.

172
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,428
- Aunt, let's take the photo here.
- Help me set up the tripod.

173
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:01,589
Over there.

174
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,308
Wind and fire come together...

175
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,077
It's starting now.

176
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,068
- I can't see. I can't take pictures.
- Get on my shoulders.

177
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,639
Get on your shoulders?

178
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,870
OK, keep still.

179
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,157
White Lotus is divine!
Power to the people!

180
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,072
Protect your home
for the sake of the country!

181
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,798
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace!

182
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,309
Foon, this position is no good.

183
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,197
So good.

184
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:43,349
White Lotus has come to save you
by driving evil away!

185
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,192
What was that?

186
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,878
Thank you.

187
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,034
She can make lightning, run away!

188
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,552
Arrest that evil spirit!

189
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,471
The top one or the bottom one?

190
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:04,754
The foreigner on top.

191
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,273
Arrest her!

192
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,429
Calm down! She is Chinese,
she's not a foreigner! Have a look.

193
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,195
Look at the way you dress.
It proves you're evil. Arrest her!

194
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,955
Stay calm! Don't!
Aunt Yee, run! I'll protect you!

195
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,272
My camera!

196
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,428
Aunt Yee!

197
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,077
Aunt Yee! Where are you, Aunt Yee?

198
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,629
Foon! Help me, Foon!

199
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,109
Kill all foreigners
so we can live in peace.

200
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,429
Take her to the temple,
burn her to death!

201
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,594
Fei-hung!

202
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,879
Who the hell are you to stop me?
Tell me your name!

203
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,995
I'm Wong Fei-hung from Fushan.

204
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,957
- Fei-hung?!
- And Leung Foon too!

205
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:05,510
I hear his kung fu is deadly.

206
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,830
Kick you, kick you... to death!

207
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,116
Leave him alone, pick on
someone else. You'll hurt him.

208
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,713
- Who else? Where?
- Hit them, don't hurt them.

209
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,313
That's enough.

210
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,276
Ten-finger punch!

211
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,749
Thank you, thank you.

212
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,307
Master.

213
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,118
- Are you all right, Aunt Yee?
- You came just in time.

214
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,438
What is it? It smells sweet.

215
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,997
It's sleeping powder.
Foon! Take care of Aunt Yee.

216
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,479
Aunt Yee, Aunt Yee.

217
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,633
Mystical power...

218
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,269
All this trickery and mumbo jumbo and
you claim to be acting in God's name!

219
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,112
Aunt Yee, wake up! Aunt Yee!

220
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,794
Aunt Yee! Help her up.

221
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,914
Foon, take Aunt Yee back to the inn.

222
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,550
Foon, what are you waiting for?

223
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,190
He's one of Canton's Ten Tigers.
His kung fu is legendary.

224
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,951
Get back!

225
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,148
Master Wong, don't!
That thing is evil!

226
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,759
Stand back!

227
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,796
Master Wong, can I be
your apprentice?

228
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,597
Back! Don't follow me!

229
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,596
- Fei-hung.
- You're awake.

230
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,430
They covered you in sleeping powder.

231
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,512
- Did you carry me back here?
- No, Foon did.

232
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,635
Why did he carry me back?

233
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,755
Foon is preparing your medicine.

234
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:39,957
Take it and rest for two days
and you'll be fine.

235
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,109
- Master Wong.
- Come in.

236
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,670
Don't go out alone,
this town is in turmoil.

237
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,035
Rest a while, don't worry.

238
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:56,349
Fei-hung, I'm all right.

239
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,954
I can still be your interpreter
at the convention tomorrow.

240
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,509
Let's talk about that later.
Take your medicine now.

241
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
- Master Wong, sorry to disturb you.
- It's OK.

242
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,557
Oh, you're awake. Did you know...

243
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,118
You carried me back.

244
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,637
Yes, I did.

245
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,627
The medicine is very hot, be careful.

246
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,795
Mr Mak, what can I do for you?

247
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,598
I sent my servant
to buy these clothes.

248
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,114
Please ask her to wear them.

249
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,588
- That's very kind of you.
- Don't mention it.

250
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,638
Mystical kung fu is very popular now.
Foreigners make them mad.

251
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,508
Master Wong, I've known you for
a long time, I'll be frank with you.

252
00:20:44,599 --> 00:20:48,673
If Miss wears her own clothes,
she'll definitely get into trouble.

253
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
I understand. How much were they?

254
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,752
- There'll be no charge.
- Thank you.

255
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:57,558
Thanks for your help, Master Wong.

256
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,234
'lf I'd known it'd be so boring,
I'd have asked So to come.'

257
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,519
'There's another one!'

258
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,192
'lt's not any of them.
Another foreigner.'

259
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,151
- Dr Wong, it's your turn.
- Foon, it's our turn.

260
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,515
- I'll let you out.
- We'll go together.

261
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,271
Thank you. Thank you.

262
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,675
My topic of discussion
for today is Chinese acupuncture.

263
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,828
Louder.

264
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,069
There are 360 pressure points...

265
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,951
Do you want him to speak louder?

266
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,919
That's not what he means.
Dr Wong, may I interpret for you?

267
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,673
- May I know your name?
- My name is Sun Yat-sen.

268
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,275
- Mr Sun, I'm most grateful to you.
- Don't mention it.

269
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:44,315
Thank you.

270
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,914
The five elements are gold,
wood, water, fire and earth.

271
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,228
They form a network.

272
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,959
Acupuncture regulates
the nervous system.

273
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,155
Dr Wong, Dr Thompson
doesn't quite understand.

274
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,633
His demonstration shows the Western
understanding of the nervous system.

275
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,472
That's quite simple -

276
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:48,155
I can use needles to close two nerves
so that he can't move his leg.

277
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,357
Master, are you going to stick
those in me?

278
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,871
Dr Sun, ask them
to test his reflexes now.

279
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,269
Join White Lotus
and save your country!

280
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,634
Foreigners out, leave us in peace!

281
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,679
Master!

282
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,755
The White Lotus Sect again!

283
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,195
Master! I can't move!

284
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,913
I'll be shot! I'm a goner!

285
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,397
Master, I've only been stabbed
by you, not them.

286
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:26,508
- Mr Sun, your bag.
- Leave it.

287
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,874
We're finished here.
Back to the Temple!

288
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,836
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

289
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,875
Mr Sun, here's your bag.

290
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,030
If we get the opportunity,
let's exchange ideas, shall we?

291
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:47,680
China needs more men like you.

292
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,159
You flatter me.

293
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,558
See you soon.

294
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,551
The White Lotus Sect is
always making trouble.

295
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,711
Master, Aunt Yee must still be
at the inn.

296
00:25:57,799 --> 00:25:59,836
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

297
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,877
The White Lotus Sect?

298
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,949
Come out!

299
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,907
Fei-hung!

300
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,435
Master, what's the matter?

301
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,112
Nothing, come on, out.

302
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,509
Master, you look pale,
something must have happened.

303
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,955
It's just a woman changing.
Mind your own business!

304
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,472
But you saw it.

305
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,710
- What a terrible noise!
- Tell him to stop.

306
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,788
Here!

307
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:16,239
Thank you, thank you...

308
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,912
Sir.

309
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,391
Telegraph House is our only contact
with the outside world. Protect it.

310
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,469
Yes, sir.

311
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,433
Sir.

312
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,915
There are a lot of bystanders,
take care not to hit them.

313
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,433
Drive the White Lotus
towards the gate.

314
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:46,555
Yes, sir.

315
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,070
Sir, if this continues,
we will be outnumbered.

316
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,428
Master!

317
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,753
Master!

318
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,553
Dinner time!

319
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,237
I got a nice treat
to help Aunt Yee get well.

320
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,719
- Is it game?
- Yes, it is.

321
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:12,755
What is it?

322
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,352
Foon, haven't you told Aunt Yee
what this is?

323
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,588
Don't you know?

324
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,710
Aunt Yee, do you like dogs?

325
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,112
They're man's best friend.
I like them more than cats, anyway.

326
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,231
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Let's eat.

327
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,075
People like dogs in different ways.

328
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,517
They went that way.

329
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,834
Canton is in chaos.
Foon, pack our things after dinner.

330
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,036
We'll go to the station
early tomorrow.

331
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,634
- Take Aunt Yee back to Fushan.
- OK.

332
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:04,997
You'd better eat well tonight, you
don't want to be sick on the train.

333
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,515
Come outside when you've finished
the dog meat, I'd like a word.

334
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:13,510
You'd like a word with me?

335
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:17,549
What did you say? This is dog meat?

336
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,597
- Is it really?
- Yes.

337
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,470
Yes, Master loves dogs.

338
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,712
- Aunt Yee.
- Yes.

339
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,792
- I want to teach you kung fu.
- Me? Why?

340
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,632
These are troubled times.

341
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,038
You could use it for self-defence.

342
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,557
The basic technique has 36 stances.
The advanced has 72 stances.

343
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,269
- There are 108 pressure points...
- Fei-hung...

344
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,237
Do I need to remember all this?

345
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,311
No, just listen
and try to get the basics.

346
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,992
Remember, for punches,
attack from the side.

347
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:08,911
For kicks, come from below.

348
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:13,829
What if someone has a knife?

349
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,069
I'll teach you that another time.

350
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,353
Look, this is the single,
this is the double.

351
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,276
- Such effort! Why don't I use a gun?
- Shut up!

352
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,069
I was a bit rude.
That's how I speak to my students.

353
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:38,957
I'm fine, let's continue.

354
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,432
OK.

355
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,633
The first move.

356
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,753
Go for my head.

357
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:49,874
Pay attention.

358
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,234
Grab the hand,
crouch down, then twist.

359
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:54,310
Grab the hand, crouch down...

360
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,230
- then twist.
- Then twist.

361
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:57,798
Let's try again.

362
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,429
Grab the hand,
crouch down, then twist.

363
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,271
The second move, throat lock.

364
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,308
Come on, attack my throat, harder.
Grab the hand, crouch down, elbow up.

365
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,634
Aunt Yee?

366
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,075
Be careful!

367
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,671
Why aren't you concentrating?

368
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,192
I was practising in my head.

369
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,479
Try it once more.

370
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:05,391
The first move, grab the head.

371
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,833
What's next?

372
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,197
Then punch!

373
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,393
Are you OK?

374
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,994
I'm OK, it's better to be your friend
than your enemy.

375
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,429
Sir, we've received a telegram
from Hong Kong.

376
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,317
We've no time for that now.

377
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,277
It says someone's planning
a rebellion here.

378
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,351
Here's the message.

379
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,592
Sir, it's another telegram
from Hong Kong.

380
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:47,748
This is serious,
guard Telegraph House well.

381
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,639
- I'll inform the Governor.
- Yes, sir.

382
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:36,358
Your Excellency.

383
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,637
The British consul invited me here,
can't this wait?

384
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,032
Our spies in Hong Kong
cabled us twice today.

385
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:48,318
The Chiu Chow Society are planning
to smuggle weapons to Canton.

386
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,597
- They want to start a revolution.
- A revolution?

387
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,034
- Is it the White Lotus Sect?
- No.

388
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,195
Their leader is called Sun Yat-sen.

389
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,557
Sun Yat-sen?

390
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,914
Officer, who is this Sun Yat-sen?

391
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,869
He's the one who started
the Agricultural Society.

392
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,188
He's a doctor,

393
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,717
he's always giving speeches
and criticising the Government.

394
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,237
He encourages democracy too.
He says China should be a republic.

395
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,719
How can a doctor rebel?

396
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,278
Do we not have enough men?

397
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,432
White Lotus has been causing trouble
recently, so we're under-manned.

398
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:30,672
The Government is having trouble
with the French in the north.

399
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,512
I think there'll be war soon.

400
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:34,795
It won't be easy
to get reinforcements.

401
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,557
The British are our allies,

402
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,393
they'll help keep the other
foreigners at bay.

403
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,878
Put the army and navy on alert
and extra men at ports and stations

404
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,518
till we find Sun Yat-sen.

405
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,431
- What was that society?
- The Agricultural Society.

406
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,668
Who else is involved with
Sun Yat-sen?

407
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,956
Someone called Luke Ho-dung
is the money man.

408
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,869
Sir, should we bring him in
for questioning?

409
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,509
- Yes, let's bring him in.
- Yes, sir.

410
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,554
- Sir?
- I'm not going.

411
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,074
Sir.

412
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,438
Chow, tell Snake to get up,
it's not his day off!

413
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,918
Did you spend all night
at the brothel? Get up!

414
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,672
Be careful, Aunt Yee. Take it easy.

415
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,351
Foon, what are you doing?

416
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,918
She twisted her ankle.

417
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,630
How come? I only showed you
hand movements. What happened?

418
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:12,512
I don't know,
it was just hurting when I got up.

419
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,597
Foon insisted on carrying me
when he found out.

420
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:17,795
Foon...

421
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,233
I don't mind, Master.

422
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,277
Well, let me carry her,
you take the luggage.

423
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,157
OK.

424
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,398
It hurts.

425
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,875
I always do the carrying.
Now you want to get involved.

426
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,748
Waiter!

427
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,672
May I help you?

428
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,398
We'd like to check out.

429
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,994
- Leave me alone!
- Get up.

430
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,592
You're too much!

431
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,237
- Mr Mak.
- Master Wong?

432
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,596
- We are leaving now.
- Oh, thank God!

433
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,715
No, no, I mean have a safe journey.

434
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,155
Sorry for the trouble.
If you're ever...

435
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,514
Fei-hung, look, what's going on?

436
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,907
Hey, what's going on?

437
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,275
The White Lotus have burned down
Friendship Hall.

438
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,793
What's Friendship Hall?

439
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,793
It's where they teach foreign
languages. It's full of students.

440
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,996
- Mr Mak, where's the school?
- Near the fruit market.

441
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:21,307
Don't go there!

442
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,867
- Aunt Yee!
- Master, where's she going?

443
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,916
Foon, you lied to me, she's OK.

444
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,150
It was her idea, Master.

445
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:29,467
Wait for me.

446
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,710
"Friendship Hall"

447
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,472
Is this it?

448
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,438
Master! Wait for me!

449
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:01,594
- What is it?
- Skin.

450
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:03,431
It's human skin.

451
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,954
Master.

452
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:25,827
It's the younger students.
It's lucky they were hiding.

453
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,992
What's happening?

454
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:34,708
Let's go and have a look.

455
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,233
What's going on in there?

456
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,992
They've gone now.
Don't worry. Be good.

457
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,719
Are you hungry? Eat something.

458
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,108
It's so gloomy in here.
Mr Mak is here!

459
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:46,554
Master Wong!
Why are you still here?

460
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,436
Are these children with you?

461
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,431
They're students.
We just needed a rest.

462
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,195
They can't stay here!
If White Lotus comes, I'm finished!

463
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,068
I don't know them, even worse,
they study foreign languages.

464
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,275
Take them to the courthouse.

465
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,112
Can't we rest for a moment?

466
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:07,112
I don't know how to fight.
This inn is all I have.

467
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,760
If it's burnt down, I'll...

468
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,909
- Mr Mak!
- Mr Mak!

469
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,472
Have you got some salts?

470
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,831
You've made him faint.
Who do you think you are?

471
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,831
If he dies, I'll call the police.

472
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,548
Then I'll back off.
Foon, Aunt Yee, let's go.

473
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,476
Let's send them home.

474
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,514
Where do you live?

475
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,193
I'm from Kwangsi Province.

476
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,190
I'm also from Kwangsi.

477
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,271
I'm from Fukien Province.

478
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,313
He's from Chuijao,
they're from Kwangsi.

479
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,072
I guess the rest
are not from here either.

480
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:45,594
Do any of you live here?

481
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,989
Miss, I live by the north gate,
so does he.

482
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:51,039
I live in Sha Min.

483
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:54,317
I think I live near the east gate.

484
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,958
I live in Shu Zhao!

485
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:57,791
Anybody else?

486
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,474
I came here on the train,
I don't know where I come from.

487
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,070
We'll take these two home.
The rest come with us.

488
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,434
I'll carry you.

489
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,230
Foon! Order some chicken rice
for our journey.

490
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,393
Waiter, 20 portions of chicken rice!
Come on, you, too.

491
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,268
Sir...

492
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,719
what can I do for you?

493
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,032
I'd like to know if the children from
Friendship Hall came here earlier?

494
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,311
Students? No, no, you've come
to the wrong place.

495
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:49,195
Have any of you seen the students?

496
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,909
There are no students here, you fool!
Maybe the boogie man's got them.

497
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,351
The King rules heaven

498
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,431
The devil rules hell...

499
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:04,436
It's lucky the students are gone.

500
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,389
Between the two there is White Lotus

501
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,632
Keeping our country safe

502
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,074
- Lucky tokens!
- I want one.

503
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,152
The hanging lantern
will keep you safe.

504
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,119
Lucky tokens
will protect your family!

505
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,356
- Light the lanterns.
- Here's the offering.

506
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,193
Lucky tokens
will protect your family!

507
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:35,396
- This will keep you safe.
- Of course, of course.

508
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,438
Give more offerings
to ensure your safety.

509
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,233
Finish up in there. We have to leave.

510
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:06,472
- I'm scared.
- Be quiet.

511
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,313
- What happened to your hands?
- It's not my blood, it's his.

512
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,559
It's everywhere.

513
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,715
He's badly injured.
We can't stay here.

514
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:22,190
I'll go to the courthouse to see
if they'll take them. Stay here.

515
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,518
- Foon.
- Yes.

516
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,159
- Help me bandage the poor kid.
- I haven't finished yet.

517
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,550
Don't be naughty. Come back here.

518
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:34,994
I just wanted to know
where he was going.

519
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:38,030
Foon, you stink.

520
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,719
- You peed on me!
- I told you I wasn't done yet.

521
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,398
"Only the truly brave reach the top"

522
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,280
Sir, Wong Fei-hung
is here to see you.

523
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,277
Master Wong, come in.

524
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,992
Sir!

525
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,715
Sir.

526
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,833
Master Wong, now I see why
you're so famous.

527
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,114
- Sorry, sorry.
- It was nothing, sir.

528
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,192
I just wanted to spar
with you a little.

529
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,157
Master Wong, your Shaolin
staff is excellent.

530
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:44,471
Maybe you can teach me
some other time.

531
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,152
Have some wine.

532
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,797
Thank you.

533
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,228
His Shaolin staff isn't that good.

534
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,074
He hit that pole, but it didn't
even move. Wong is full of himself.

535
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,914
All our troops are busy
protecting foreigners.

536
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,230
It may not be that safe here either.

537
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,878
If the students come here,

538
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,713
the White Lotus will come
to cause trouble.

539
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,789
Sir...

540
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,030
I know it's my job
to protect the people.

541
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,429
The trouble is
even though I can fight,

542
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,510
I don't have the men to support me.

543
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:27,356
I'm deeply ashamed.

544
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:39,514
Foon, come over here.

545
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,827
Stay out of the way.

546
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,351
He is still bleeding.

547
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,349
Master isn't back yet.
What shall we do?

548
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,193
- He's not moving.
- Why isn't he moving?

549
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,233
- It's Mozart.
- What do you mean?

550
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,039
Listen. Can't you hear
the foreign music?

551
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:02,875
There must be
a foreign consulate nearby.

552
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,711
A consulate?

553
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,398
Beware of fire!

554
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:16,793
Beware of thieves!

555
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,871
Aunt Yee, Foon!

556
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,992
- I need to pee.
- Wait until you're home.

557
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:24,876
It's bad for my kidneys.

558
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,711
So? They're rotten anyway.

559
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,835
Don't move!

560
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,148
Stay there!

561
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,309
Where has the sect taken
the woman and children?

562
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,478
We aren't with White Lotus.

563
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,472
My children are in bed now.
My woman has run off...

564
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,478
Foon, where did you go?

565
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,748
Aunt Yee took the children
to a safe place.

566
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,193
Really?

567
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:54,637
Why are you holding
a White Lotus lantern?

568
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:58,507
To bring us good luck.
But it doesn't seem to have worked.

569
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:00,112
- May I go now?
- Yes!

570
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:04,190
Come on, hurry.

571
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,876
Foon, let's go.

572
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,713
Don't you remember me?
I came with the children...

573
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,836
and a beautiful lady.

574
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,356
I only left to find my master.

575
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,110
I don't understand you.

576
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:23,157
Foon, did Aunt Yee bring
the children here?

577
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:25,753
Yes, he let us in before,
but now he won't.

578
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,108
Aunt Yee! Aunt Yee!

579
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:31,110
I've come with Master!

580
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,195
- Did he ask us to stand up straight?
- That's what I heard.

581
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,592
Aunt Yee, we are waiting
at the entrance.

582
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,875
Master, they're opening the gate.

583
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,155
- How dare you!
- Foon, stay calm.

584
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,036
Don't hit me!

585
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,110
- Tell them why we're here.
- I have!

586
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:00,112
- Put your guns down.
- They don't understand.

587
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:02,429
- Stop pointing that at me!
- Stop!

588
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,512
Pardon me.

589
00:51:10,519 --> 00:51:12,795
My name is Luke Ho-dung, and yours?

590
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,632
I'm Wong Fei-hung from Fushan.

591
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,030
Wong Fei-hung?
You saved the children!

592
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,829
Yes, they're all inside,
but the soldiers won't let us in.

593
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,148
Allow me.

594
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:22,152
I don't understand...

595
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:27,952
Why do foreigners believe in a god
whose face has so much suffering?

596
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,110
Everyone has a god in their heart.

597
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:35,394
When we're young
we believe in one god,

598
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,835
when we're older
we believe in another.

599
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,434
Finally we realise all beliefs
are just lies.

600
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:46,909
Why are you always looking at your
watch? Are you expecting someone?

601
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,355
A bad habit I picked up
from a friend.

602
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,150
He says time is valuable.
We Chinese waste a lot of time.

603
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:00,309
I still can't read foreign numbers!
I'll never keep good time.

604
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,590
Stay where you are.

605
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,159
Don't be afraid.

606
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,434
Foon, take them upstairs.

607
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:35,793
They're foreign merchants
and their families.

608
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,474
They've been attacked by White Lotus
and have come to seek refuge.

609
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,398
They need a doctor.

610
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,869
Master is the one they need. Master!

611
00:53:57,639 --> 00:53:59,994
They're looking for a doctor.

612
00:54:07,639 --> 00:54:09,789
They don't want Chinese doctors.

613
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:17,277
Mr Sun.

614
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,952
Mr Wong.

615
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:20,954
This is...

616
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:24,952
No need to introduce me. He's the one
who's always looking at his watch.

617
00:54:25,719 --> 00:54:27,789
White Lotus will free the poor!

618
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,077
Kill the foreigners
so we can live in peace!

619
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:42,278
Burn the foreigners' belongings!

620
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,679
Aunt Yee.

621
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,918
Burn it down!

622
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,559
White Lotus will free the poor!

623
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:53,188
Kill the foreigners
so we can live in peace!

624
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,793
White Lotus are making trouble again.

625
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:02,954
Mr Luke.

626
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:08,275
Which one tells the right time?

627
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,717
Your watch is fast, Sun.
Mine can't keep up with yours.

628
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,233
Enough of this,
let's check the injured.

629
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,711
Foon, I never thought
time was so important.

630
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,869
I didn't think you'd understand.

631
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,153
Burn the foreign devils!
Chase them out!

632
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,599
Aunt Yee.

633
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:56,239
Oh, no, they must have
taken her soul!

634
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,914
If they're so clever,
they would have won by now.

635
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,152
They're just trying to scare us.
Don't worry, just relax.

636
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:07,632
What if she vomits?

637
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:11,271
We're not on the train now.

638
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,235
Mr Luke.
