1
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,391
You again!

2
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,568
You threw up in my cab.
Took me hours to clean it!

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,876
You're not worth the $15 fare!

4
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:17,985
Shut up!

5
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,901
Stay back, or I'll kill her!

6
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,029
Stay back!

7
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,974
Calm down, Mr. Wong

8
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,503
Let me see your boss Eric Chow

9
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:35,213
Or I'll kill this bastard

10
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,909
Tell me! How did you cheat me of my money?

11
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:40,051
I didn't, sir, I'm sorry

12
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,115
You seemed arrogant enough just now

13
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,985
You were forcing me to repay you.
Now you're backing out?

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:48,983
Stay back!

15
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:50,151
Mr. Wong!

16
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,153
Calm down, Mr. Wong!

17
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,424
Stop talking and call the press!

18
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,230
I'm prepared to die

19
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,560
Fine

20
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,029
Where's the press?

21
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,070
There's a grenade; I'm not going there

22
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,874
Calm down Mr. Wong, the press is here

23
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,446
Say anything, just calm down

24
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:13,674
Please

25
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,219
Point the camera at me

26
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,848
Come out, Eric Chow

27
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,326
You leach, you forced me
to gamble on stocks...

28
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,258
You said I'd make big money
and everything would be fine

29
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,723
Told me to use company funds

30
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,999
You want my life?

31
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,202
Here it is

32
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,270
Eric you bastard, come out!

33
00:04:32,705 --> 00:04:33,729
Come out!

34
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,699
What are you doing?

35
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,973
Stay back! Calm down!

36
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,139
Nobody move!

37
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:06,932
Inspector Chan! Get the hostage!

38
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,601
Open the manhole cover!

39
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,345
There! Quick!

40
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:25,780
Get down!

41
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,361
Are you all right?

42
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,134
I'm fine, disperse the crowd

43
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,973
Go! Give me back my money!

44
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,706
Thank you, Officer Chan

45
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:50,971
He's crazy

46
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,912
In stocks, some win, some lose

47
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,246
Throw the book at him

48
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,717
Put him in jail

49
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,783
I'd be broke if everyone's like him

50
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:03,451
Who are you?

51
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,963
Here's my card

52
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,631
I'm Eric Chow

53
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,256
Call me if you want to speculate

54
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,744
Don't just stand there, move it,
collect the evidence

55
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:19,934
Yes, sir. I'll help you

56
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:21,502
Good thing you wore two bulletproof vests

57
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,195
Look at you, so you've got a few awards

58
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,228
So proud of yourselves

59
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,568
You think we're that good?

60
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,398
Chiu, you worked crowd control

61
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,303
How did all those people get past you?

62
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,376
All the reporters became hostages as well

63
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,047
A lot of people could have been hurt

64
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,386
Were you controlling the crowd
or was the crowd controlling you?

65
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,955
Come here, Hong

66
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,786
How can you let the criminal
draw faster than you?

67
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,290
Didn't I teach you how to draw? Show me

68
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,294
Your jacket is in the way

69
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,610
Your pocket is too full

70
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,283
Put in a lucky stone

71
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,314
Listen to your future brother-in-law;
stay sharp!

72
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:38,746
Yes, sister

73
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,489
Everyone, take lunch

74
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,823
Great, lunchtime!

75
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:48,458
Wing, don't you have something
to say to me today?

76
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,957
What?

77
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:53,438
Don't you have a birthday message
for the rest of your team?

78
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:55,732
Do I have to?

79
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,807
Happy birthday; let's eat!

80
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,069
Open the safe!

81
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:16,670
Open it!

82
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,448
I'm just a worker

83
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,286
We're the bomb!

84
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,586
Do you have a phone?

85
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,455
Yes

86
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,959
Call the cops!

87
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:41,965
Call the cops!

88
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:13,533
Don't hurt me, I'm just a worker

89
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,205
Just a worker

90
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,425
Police! Drop your guns!

91
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,705
They're heavily armed --

92
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,669
Three, four...

93
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:53,875
Three, four...

94
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,342
Five! Okay!

95
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:00,416
Five, six...

96
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,031
Calm down!

97
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,687
Yeah, man!

98
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,586
Go!

99
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,176
Don't move!

100
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,612
Drop your guns!

101
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,683
Drop your guns!

102
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,855
Check the alley Yes, sir!

103
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,524
Clear

104
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,736
Kin!

105
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:08,778
The Bank of Asia was robbed today
by 5 masked gun men...

106
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,307
Listen, Joe gets 100 points.

107
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,977
Fire and Tin Tin 80 each, me 60.

108
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,152
20 points for hitting a cop
30 points for an officer

109
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,617
10 if you blow up a police car

110
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,054
That's $1 million per point,
The rest goes in the pot

111
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:28,263
But Sue you dropped the money,
You lose 200 points

112
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,993
Nonsense! No one helped me!
How can you do this to me?

113
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,437
Stop fighting about money.
Money is not important

114
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:44,942
Sue, another mistake and you're out

115
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,618
The police held a press conference

116
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,985
Senior Inspector Chan said:

117
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,716
3 hours

118
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,184
We're confident we'll get them in 3 hours

119
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,391
Their actions of challenging the police...

120
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,260
show that they're just naive crooks

121
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,262
I guarantee to the public...

122
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,996
we'll put them away

123
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,538
Are you okay?

124
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:18,772
Sam

125
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:21,583
I almost died

126
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,422
I want to get out of the hospital
and catch them myself

127
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:28,951
Don't worry, we'll get them tonight

128
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,485
You have any leads?

129
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,721
My informant found their hide-out

130
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,802
They plan to use police officers as targets

131
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,131
Notify SDU

132
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,271
Don't you know, I am the SDU!

133
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,068
Don't worry, Sam

134
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,838
We're better than the SDU

135
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,414
Yes, you guys...

136
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:05,287
Some thugs from a finance company
came to see you today

137
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,400
Don't worry, I'll pay the debt

138
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,228
If you need help, tell me

139
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,867
I'll do what I can

140
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,063
Sure

141
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,198
Wing...

142
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,942
Show no mercy in dealing with them

143
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:25,772
They're crazy

144
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,012
Sneak out for a drink tonight if you can

145
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,487
I.D. them tomorrow if you're okay

146
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:37,023
I admire your self-confidence

147
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,962
You must quit gambling

148
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:25,837
Stay in the car, relax,
let me take care of this

149
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:27,971
Looking for a promotion?

150
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,479
Why not? Hurry, I have things to do later

151
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:31,673
Me too

152
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:33,985
I must pack for my vacation tonight

153
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,846
Leave it to me, sir!

154
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,181
Nice try

155
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,378
It's not your turn yet

156
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,723
Get to work

157
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,550
We'll relax at dinner

158
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,929
Separate into two teams, A Team goes first

159
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:46,221
Yes sir!

160
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,760
Move!

161
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,224
Clear! Clear!

162
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,624
Someone's there! Calm down

163
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,427
Don't move or I'll shoot! Don't move!

164
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,179
Split up into A and B, two men stay here

165
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,246
Copy!

166
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,034
Time to play!

167
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:37,964
What?

168
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,999
Don't panic!

169
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,776
Inspector Chan...

170
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,943
Tin Ming?

171
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,815
He can't hear you

172
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,115
Tin Ming!

173
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:56,883
Rick!

174
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,363
Hoi, stay here with the men

175
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,771
Yes, sir!

176
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:11,965
Hong, come with me

177
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,451
Where are they? Where did they go?

178
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:28,682
Stay back!

179
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:46,633
Freeze!

180
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,105
Tin Ming!

181
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:53,740
Open up!

182
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:01,815
Quick!

183
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:05,352
Gunfire!

184
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,947
Where are they?

185
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:34,981
Quiet!

186
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,050
Hold on

187
00:22:04,589 --> 00:22:05,578
Come out!

188
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,324
Kwong...

189
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,492
Inspector Chan...

190
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:14,292
Stay calm

191
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,569
Someone's there

192
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,709
Hong, stay!

193
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,375
Hong!

194
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:38,179
Stop!

195
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,561
Hong!

196
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,590
Inspector Chan, help me!

197
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,013
Brother-in-law...

198
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,820
Hong! Brother-in-law...

199
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,014
Hold on, Hong!

200
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,434
What happened?

201
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:36,297
Help me...

202
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,901
Where are you?

203
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,408
Come out! Why did you do this?

204
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,086
The fact that you're still alive
doesn't mean you're better

205
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,080
It just means we're not done
playing with you yet

206
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:54,786
Who are you?

207
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,860
We're cop haters

208
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,989
Let them go

209
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:04,795
After you drop your gun

210
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,959
Let them go!

211
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:13,833
No!

212
00:25:20,785 --> 00:25:23,379
Chiu!

213
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,490
I'll say this once

214
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:31,718
What do you want?

215
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,587
To play with you

216
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,500
You're the police pistol champion right?

217
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:42,105
You must know how to field strip a gun
let's see who does it faster

218
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:43,997
Come on!

219
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,802
What are the rules?

220
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,183
These are your men's guns

221
00:25:54,185 --> 00:25:57,177
Whoever assembles them the fastest wins

222
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:58,611
We're playing for two men

223
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,462
Okay

224
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,629
Ready, One...

225
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,733
Two...

226
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,028
Three!

227
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:27,312
Help, Brother-in-law!

228
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,263
You lose!

229
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:44,562
No!

230
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,404
What else do you want to play?

231
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:50,830
My turn!

232
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,241
You're the police combat coach

233
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,220
I bet I can beat you in 20 seconds

234
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,379
For two men

235
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,882
Sure

236
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,955
Ready... Go!

237
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:39,512
Good-bye!

238
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,825
No!

239
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,360
You lost again!

240
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:50,726
Kill me too!

241
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:52,760
Aren't you the bragger who said...

242
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,167
you'd get us in 3 hours?

243
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,541
You're less sure now, aren't you?

244
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,140
Let them go!

245
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,703
On your knees

246
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,652
Kowtow!

247
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:15,285
Please let them go

248
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,792
Okay, one more chance

249
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,889
Same rules

250
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,857
Come on

251
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,363
Okay

252
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,339
For four this time!

253
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,241
Bravo!

254
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,037
Okay!

255
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,376
Ready? Go!

256
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:01,294
Great!

257
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,909
But you took 3 seconds too long.
Take one for each second

258
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:11,080
Yes, sir!

259
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,677
No!

260
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:20,389
Why?

261
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:33,235
Why?

262
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,706
Brother-in-law, go

263
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,871
Hong, hang in there!

264
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:44,975
Don't kill him yet

265
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:45,642
Hong!

266
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,072
Wake up!

267
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,947
You're okay, hang on

268
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:01,351
Bombs! I've got to get them out

269
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,525
Hong, hold on! I'll get you out

270
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,456
Help!

271
00:35:05,002 --> 00:35:06,230
Stop the robbers!

272
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,339
Out of my way!

273
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:12,431
Move it!

274
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:15,936
Move it! Get out!

275
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,174
You drunk!

276
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,777
His wallet

277
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,514
He's a cop

278
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,024
Just for that, let's go!

279
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:28,181
There are so many great things waiting for you

280
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:34,185
Forget the past, turn your pain into your power

281
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,411
Who are you?

282
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,957
PC 1667 reporting for duty!

283
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,921
I'm your partner Frank Cheng

284
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,650
I don't need a partner

285
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,724
I'm taking a year off

286
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,628
Inspector Tai cancelled your leave

287
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:22,995
Don't touch my stuff

288
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,035
But it's a mess

289
00:37:26,811 --> 00:37:29,507
Your attitude is unacceptable

290
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:33,306
In order to change your life,
You must first change yourself

291
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,482
Throw out useless things...

292
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:38,921
so you can find what you want

293
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,088
Stop nagging and get me some water!

294
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,782
Your girlfriend was here

295
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,960
She has something very important
for me to give to you

296
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:46,790
A ring

297
00:37:53,304 --> 00:37:55,966
Don't touch it, just go

298
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,303
I have more to say

299
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:00,706
Please listen to me

300
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,074
Listen

301
00:38:07,251 --> 00:38:10,743
The bank robbers from 3 months ago
pulled another job...

302
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:12,652
we lost many men

303
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,421
Inspector Tai wants you to handle this case

304
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,888
Of the thousands of policemen
in Hong Kong, why me?

305
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,965
I don't know why, he didn't say

306
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,372
They're insane they're not doing it for money

307
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,106
and recently...

308
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,301
they've turned your case into an online game

309
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,945
I think they're using the online game to

310
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,784
Don't talk about the case anymore,
get out of here!

311
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,187
Go! Go away! Listen to me sir...

312
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:45,544
Go!

313
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,219
Inspector Chan, it's me

314
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,761
You again! Leave me alone!

315
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,163
I'm at your girlfriend's home

316
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,324
Is something wrong?

317
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:08,097
Of course

318
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,028
What happened to her?

319
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:11,404
Why else would I call?

320
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,564
How is she?

321
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,236
Come quickly

322
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,844
Don't go anywhere, I'm coming

323
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,208
Smells good!

324
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,281
It's better with more olive oil

325
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,478
Let me taste

326
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:27,991
It's hot

327
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:32,985
It's good

328
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,122
Of course

329
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,456
I've given him the ring

330
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,899
He was shocked to see it

331
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,801
He cares for you

332
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,999
He just can't forgive himself

333
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,157
Who is it?

334
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,431
Just come in

335
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:30,676
Sit down

336
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,150
What are you doing here?

337
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,888
I only did what you asked
and now you're kicking me out?

338
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:51,136
You asked me to buy it, It's about $200

339
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,999
and $500 for hurting my eyes

340
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:56,873
I thought you forgot

341
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:14,562
He chose the cake, I just delivered it

342
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:35,848
Happy Birthday to You...

343
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,823
Happy Birthday to You...

344
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:51,224
Happy Birthday to You

345
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,408
It's a happy day, smile

346
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:12,080
Make a wish, blow out the candle

347
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,399
Oh, I forgot the door

348
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,165
Sit down

349
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,693
Eat while it's warm

350
00:43:57,001 --> 00:43:57,990
What are you writing?

351
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:02,594
Nothing

352
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,735
I know

353
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:07,968
sorry

354
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,481
Why don't you throw them away?

355
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:28,462
Why should I?

356
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,128
You can't throw away the memory

357
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,037
I know you won't forgive me

358
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,507
That's only what you think

359
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:50,044
I'm a nurse and all the time I'm wondering...

360
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,414
If there's a cure for missing someone

361
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,013
What do you think?

362
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,450
There is

363
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,597
It's to see the person you miss

364
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:06,958
What if you don't?

365
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,944
In time it becomes...

366
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,246
a memory

367
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:25,677
I understand

368
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:30,627
I can't forgive myself

369
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:47,872
Does drinking help?

370
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:52,608
You want to avenge your team,
But all you're doing is...

371
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,712
drinking yourself to death

372
00:45:57,554 --> 00:46:00,523
So catch them as fast as you can

373
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,791
How else can you get even for your men?

374
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,693
I've researched them for you

375
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,631
They're not after money

376
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:21,775
Let me finish

377
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,908
My research indicates...

378
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,343
they love video games

379
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,280
The weapons they use...

380
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,885
are European imports which indicates...

381
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:33,312
it's not cheap stuff. These guys are rich

382
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:37,858
Go home

383
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,317
Help! Over there!

384
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,588
I've been robbed!

385
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,254
Police! Freeze!

386
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,488
My bag!

387
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,406
How dare you?

388
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,072
Get him!

389
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:05,777
Go to hell!

390
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,024
No...

391
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,158
Get away!
Wake up! Stop him!

392
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:22,165
Chan, you're a policeman. Stop the thief!

393
00:47:23,707 --> 00:47:26,938
You again? Move it!

394
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:30,304
Move it!

395
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,009
You're a policeman!

396
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,645
You asked for it!

397
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,053
Ow!

398
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,751
Let go of me, drunk!

399
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,428
You'll break my arm...

400
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:10,384
I was greedy and I...

401
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:16,423
took her bag, sorry

402
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,262
I feel very...

403
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:24,991
How do you spell guilty?

404
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,463
I... forgot

405
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,566
Guilty?

406
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:36,735
As in I am guilty?

407
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,812
Look it up in jail; you'll have time

408
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,550
Then you'll remember it

409
00:48:47,724 --> 00:48:50,454
Write gully, it's close enough

410
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,720
Madam

411
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:59,728
I need a tissue

412
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:01,826
I'll get it

413
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,933
How do we get them to their cells?

414
00:49:08,245 --> 00:49:09,405
Just do it

415
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,545
I mean, how?

416
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,511
Sorry, I'm new here

417
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:23,181
Go

418
00:49:24,094 --> 00:49:25,425
Say a good word for us

419
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,118
Thank you

420
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:28,153
Stop crying

421
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,422
Remember to look up guilty

422
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:33,491
What did they do?

423
00:49:34,271 --> 00:49:35,260
Misdemeanor

424
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,807
I'm Frank Cheng senior inspector...

425
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,301
I'm not done yet

426
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,544
I'm the senior inspector's partner

427
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,807
PC 1667

428
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,178
I...

429
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,350
I'm Sasa, technical support

430
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,472
Look everyone, our hero's back

431
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:20,339
What award do you want this time?

432
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,610
You're not ashamed?

433
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,547
You're not welcome here

434
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:32,087
Who are you, the Police Commissioner?

435
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:34,352
Who are you?

436
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,022
PC 1667, sir!

437
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,626
Who's your superior?

438
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,497
I'm on the Bank of Asia case, sir

439
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,104
I didn't know I had a partner

440
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,338
I didn't mean you. I'm with Inspector Chan

441
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:57,019
I'm in charge of this case, not him

442
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,149
Go ahead, go with him

443
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,457
I transferred to be with you, not him

444
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:12,023
Can he solve this case?

445
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:18,303
Let me tell you Chan's story

446
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:25,272
He led 9 men on a mission

447
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,910
They all died, didn't you know?

448
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:32,478
All of us here have lost...

449
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:34,415
someone close

450
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,156
Because of his arrogance!

451
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,489
Tell me, who's responsible for their deaths?

452
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:41,619
Yes, sir!

453
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:45,100
But I know he solved...

454
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:48,832
every other case before the Bank of Asia

455
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,774
He's here to finish the job

456
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,471
So if you're afraid...

457
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,613
he'll solve it faster than you...

458
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,545
I'll completely understand, sir!

459
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:15,453
All right, I'll let the two of you work on it

460
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,532
See who solves it first!

461
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:18,990
What's at stake?

462
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,500
The loser kowtows and apologizes

463
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:23,862
I accept

464
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,263
Who asked you?

465
00:52:28,578 --> 00:52:31,706
Inspector Chan?

466
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:33,838
I refuse to bet

467
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,751
He offered

468
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:41,853
Loser will resign

469
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,381
Stop!

470
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,421
Deal!

471
00:52:47,564 --> 00:52:48,553
Deal!

472
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:56,194
Where are we going?

473
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:57,862
Home, to sleep

474
00:52:58,308 --> 00:53:00,640
We made a bet

475
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,300
We'll lose for sure

476
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,035
Why did you bet?

477
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,945
I don't want to be a cop

478
00:53:06,216 --> 00:53:08,013
But I'm your partner!

479
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,916
Why must you investigate this case?
Who are you?

480
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,584
PC 1667

481
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:19,384
And?

482
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,089
PC 1667

483
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,096
I am Kwong's younger brother

484
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:32,098
Remember your teammate Kwong?

485
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:35,001
I'm his brother

486
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,143
I must get the gang that killed him

487
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:45,246
So you know your way home

488
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:48,180
Where were you last night?

489
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,287
I had a meeting, none of your business

490
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,389
You're my wife!

491
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:57,156
If I can't handle you,
how can I handle the police?

492
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:00,698
What are you, just trash!

493
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,130
You're just a cop

494
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,203
People are nice to you because of my dad

495
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:09,836
Lucky your son's not like you

496
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,681
You think you're great...
because you're a superintendent

497
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:14,372
What are you talking about?

498
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,880
I've worked hard to get where I am

499
00:54:18,688 --> 00:54:21,782
Your son is just like you, trash!

500
00:54:21,958 --> 00:54:23,755
What? You spoiled him!

501
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,952
What kind of a father are you?
All you do is beat him

502
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,632
Get up! Trash

503
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,257
Look at the time

504
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:34,969
Look!

505
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,764
All you do is surf the web
and spend money all day

506
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:42,102
I'm the chief superintendent,
you've made me lose face

507
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:49,007
Look at yourself, you're not like me at all!

508
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,111
Trash!

509
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:59,252
Joe, don't mind him

510
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,359
If you don't want to work today, stay home

511
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,097
Mommy will give you some money

512
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:07,192
Do what you want, okay?

513
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,245
Recently, citizens complained...

514
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:18,778
about police attitude

515
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,583
I say again

516
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,148
When on duty, police officers...

517
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:30,290
must be lawful and fair

518
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:36,190
I guarantee the police will...

519
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:40,300
handle problems properly and justly

520
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:28,776
You know, guys, when you found that
one thing that gets you really excited,

521
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:34,046
it's higher than any drug in the world!

522
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:37,819
Oh, man!

523
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,036
I told you they love video games

524
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,103
They turned your case into an online game

525
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:00,872
Who are they?

526
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,887
Hard to say, they posted it
on servers from different countries

527
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,580
Sasa

528
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,996
This is the alley behind the Bank of Asia

529
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:17,591
Watch this criminal...

530
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,201
before and after entering the alley

531
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:26,397
The bag

532
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,905
Sam ran into them there

533
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,342
That means he's with them

534
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,039
Sam?

535
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:37,712
Why do you always wear this?

536
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,081
This jacket is important to me

537
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,688
What do you want?

538
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:51,722
Sam Wong

539
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:53,698
Who is Sam Wong?

540
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:55,095
One of your bosses

541
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,369
He used to be a cop

542
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:02,878
Sam Wong?

543
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,305
Don't know him; beat it!

544
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,306
Don't shove me!

545
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:09,574
Careful!

546
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,808
Move it!

547
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,586
How dare you?

548
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:15,556
What are you doing?

549
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,456
Police!

550
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,482
Help!

551
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,384
Calm down!

552
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,672
You hit a policeman

553
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,667
Don't come out!

554
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,535
Oh! He's the man!

555
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,705
Wing

556
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,291
What's up, Sam?

557
01:00:03,866 --> 01:00:05,026
Why are you hiding here?

558
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,801
I'm not hiding, it's business

559
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:11,738
Sam

560
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,741
What?

561
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,764
Boss wants you

562
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,338
What's up, boss?

563
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,345
Why are the police here?

564
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:24,343
Don't think you're so great
because you're a shareholder

565
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:26,283
It won't happen again

566
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:29,048
Next time I can't protect you

567
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:30,247
Yes sir

568
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,018
Get out of here!

569
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:45,272
I'm here about the robbery

570
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:48,676
Only you were in that alley

571
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,312
Wing, I really can't remember

572
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:54,344
I can't remember

573
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,183
You were a policeman, shouldn't
you have been more observant?

574
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:02,947
Do you remember...

575
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,589
a woman with a bag?

576
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,157
You're talking nonsense, kid!

577
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:15,160
Wing, I really can't remember

578
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,401
Don't ask me again

579
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,335
I quit the force because of this case

580
01:01:23,646 --> 01:01:26,706
I welcome you as a friend

581
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:30,714
But if you want my help, I'm sorry

582
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:32,877
Sam

583
01:01:34,757 --> 01:01:38,921
They were like my brothers; Help me

584
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,884
All I know is, one is a woman

585
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:06,811
They love to play X-Games

586
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:10,391
I pulled this watch from her

587
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,120
That's all I can do

588
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,858
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

589
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:18,989
Be careful

590
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:36,683
This is the X-Crusader's logo

591
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,654
A gang of X-Gamers

592
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:48,662
They're at the roof of Shing Mau Center today

593
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,593
Got it, Thanks, bye

594
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:53,858
X-Game

595
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,169
B-Team, follow them

596
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:12,870
How stupid!

597
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:32,356
The red-haired one

598
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,233
Move in!

599
01:04:42,311 --> 01:04:43,710
Move, police business!

600
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:46,143
Move, police business!

601
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,243
The cops are here

602
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,847
Try to get out, I'll meet you downstairs

603
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,933
Find them for me or you'll be sorry

604
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:08,325
Be careful

605
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,665
Everyone quiet!

606
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:18,969
Your friend
