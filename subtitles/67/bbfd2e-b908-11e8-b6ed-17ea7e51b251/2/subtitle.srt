1
00:00:02,972 --> 00:00:05,270
Get down! Get down!

2
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,555
We've a man down, PC 1667 call an ambulance!

3
00:00:23,726 --> 00:00:25,353
Sam...

4
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:32,493
I took that bag of money...

5
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:34,366
to pay the loan sharks...

6
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:39,362
but they found me...

7
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:47,037
I told them your plans...

8
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:54,986
I'm responsible... for the death of the team

9
00:00:55,924 --> 00:01:00,327
I'm so sorry...

10
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:04,455
Wing...

11
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:09,201
I'm sorry...

12
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,528
Stay calm! Get down!

13
00:07:07,362 --> 00:07:12,356
Stay where you are! Don't move!

14
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,826
Frank!

15
00:07:22,144 --> 00:07:26,240
Frank!

16
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,320
You're the man!

17
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,097
Inspector Tai!

18
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,271
I bow to you...

19
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:04,074
as soon as you return you cause problems

20
00:08:04,686 --> 00:08:06,984
I have 72 complaints...

21
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:08,689
from other...

22
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,754
governmental departments...

23
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,586
and citizens

24
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:15,460
You tell me...

25
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:18,129
what to say to them

26
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:19,956
Sorry, sir

27
00:08:20,802 --> 00:08:23,100
We found the gang that robbed the Bank of Asia

28
00:08:23,338 --> 00:08:25,465
Wait, when did you come back?

29
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,104
You had me brought back

30
00:08:28,109 --> 00:08:29,167
I did?

31
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:32,345
You told PC 1667...

32
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,420
Do you make noodles for everyone?

33
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,278
No

34
00:08:42,724 --> 00:08:46,455
Noodles are comforting

35
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:48,995
When I need comforting, I think of you

36
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:52,257
It's that simple?

37
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,057
What more do you want?

38
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,594
Inspector Chan?

39
00:08:58,273 --> 00:09:00,434
We were just talking about you

40
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:08,705
I'm busy

41
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,490
Why are you impersonating a policeman?

42
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:30,637
More than 10 years ago,
a man stole food for his son

43
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:35,803
When he came out of the store,
he was run over by a truck

44
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,504
A kind policeman...

45
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:47,046
I gave you a chance to explain.
Why are you still lying?

46
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:49,148
I'm telling the truth

47
00:09:51,026 --> 00:09:52,994
You are not Kwong's younger brother

48
00:09:53,795 --> 00:09:54,784
Who are you?

49
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,622
I've always wanted to be a policeman,
but I couldn't

50
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,364
To me, be a good policeman...

51
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,173
Why did you get into my business?

52
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:11,607
True, I'm not a policeman

53
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,009
but did I ever harm you?

54
00:10:22,524 --> 00:10:24,719
No, neither did I

55
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,459
Nor will he

56
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:28,689
I've told Sasa's friends...

57
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,792
they must win the game

58
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,567
Then we'll know their next move

59
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:40,797
Believe me

60
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,458
Do you regret being with me?

61
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:36,957
We have composites of the suspects

62
00:11:37,499 --> 00:11:38,488
Sasa

63
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,294
Sue Chow, daughter of a shipping magnate

64
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:42,558
She's disappeared

65
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:45,469

66
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,799
Ex-US Marine

67
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,443
This Ferrari is owned by Tin Tin Law

68
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:52,644
His father is president of Kam Fuk Securities

69
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,616
Max Leung, genius game creator

70
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:57,249
Father is Wing Yu International's K. H. Leung

71
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,111
Mother is Japanese

72
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,286
Joe Kwan works for his mother

73
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:07,492
He studied in America
An under-achiever

74
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,498
Most importantly...

75
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,002
his father is a policeman

76
00:12:16,104 --> 00:12:17,765
Chief superintendent of Northern District

77
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:21,307
All from rich families

78
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,501
They have no purpose in life

79
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:28,037
Track him

80
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,412
Chan Kwok Wing, senior inspector

81
00:12:32,087 --> 00:12:34,817
He was suspended one year after our incident

82
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,684
His girlfriend won't marry him

83
00:13:13,328 --> 00:13:14,989
If you want to be a policeman,
why don't you join the academy?

84
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,731
Because my dad was a thief

85
00:13:20,902 --> 00:13:23,166
Don't you dare lie to me again

86
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:29,465
He's toying with you

87
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:53,856
That's your girlfriend's home

88
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,854
I'm best of the best at games

89
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,082
Play with me, and you'll lose

90
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,382
Leave her alone

91
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:21,618
Sorry, whatever I say goes

92
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:25,860
Game start, at police headquarters

93
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:44,012
Bye!

94
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:08,873
Ho Yee, what brings you here?

95
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:10,606
I got a call, they said Inspector Chan's in
trouble

96
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,312
And told me to come see him

97
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:14,773
Nothing happened here

98
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:17,245
Wait in the briefing room, I'll go get him

Yes

103
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,613
I called you

104
00:15:48,349 --> 00:15:49,338
What happened to him?

105
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:55,354
He's coming; I'm his good friend

106
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,458
Please give this to him

107
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:10,531
This bomb must be kept stable

108
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,172
if the balls are not centered...

109
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,969
the bomb will explode so don't move

110
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:20,069
You have 10 minutes

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,383

112
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,124

113
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,749

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,729
Thanks

116
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:07,385
Get everyone out!

117
00:17:08,062 --> 00:17:11,122
It's a bomb, run!

118
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:13,563
Call the bomb squad!

119
00:17:21,542 --> 00:17:23,976
Don't be afraid

120
00:17:25,013 --> 00:17:26,810
What do we do?

121
00:17:27,382 --> 00:17:30,215
Help me carry her to the safe room

122
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,919
Remember the balls must remain centered

123
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,183
Got it

124
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,190
Just go

125
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:44,526
1...

126
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,055
2...

127
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:47,723
3

128
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:50,993
My foot's numb

129
00:17:55,877 --> 00:17:56,866
It's okay

130
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:04,974
Let her sit

131
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,789
Wait

132
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,999
It's usually the red wire...

133
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,803
or blue, or yellow...

134
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:28,833
Get out of here!

135
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,205
Inspector Chan!

136
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,472
Inspector Chan!

137
00:18:33,247 --> 00:18:34,236
Ho Yee!

138
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:39,208
Don't be afraid!

139
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:42,511
I'm not

140
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,750
As long as you're here,
I'm not afraid of anything

141
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:52,825
Sorry

142
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,703
Like you, my brother was also a policeman

143
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:01,637
I knew something might happen to him

144
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:06,945
If I must blame someone, I'd blame his killers

145
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,444
I never blamed you for his death

146
00:19:10,585 --> 00:19:12,780
You know how much it hurts me...

147
00:19:14,455 --> 00:19:16,013
to see you like this, this past year?

148
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,657
Put the safe room on screen!

149
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:33,907
I'm Inspector Chik from the bomb squad

150
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:34,997
What's the situation?

151
00:19:35,343 --> 00:19:38,335
I think I've stabilized it

152
00:19:38,913 --> 00:19:41,211
There are circuit boards in different layers

153
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:43,349
It could be any wire

154
00:19:47,054 --> 00:19:49,147
Don't cut any of them
each circuit has a feedback

155
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:50,782
Any wire may trigger the bomb

156
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,128
I couldn't save Hong

157
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,764
But I must save you

158
00:20:11,479 --> 00:20:14,573
You may think I'm stupid but...

159
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:17,944
Do you love me?

160
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:30,263
In this life and the next...

161
00:20:33,267 --> 00:20:34,359
I will love you

162
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:53,852
Last option, freeze it chemically

163
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:58,547
Be right back

164
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,409
She's cutting the wires!

165
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:04,813
Ho Yee!

166
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:27,444
It could be a fake

167
00:22:27,882 --> 00:22:28,906
Get out of there!

168
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,549
Wait

169
00:22:41,796 --> 00:22:43,195
Don't move What?

170
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:47,594
Run!

171
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:20,627
Ho Yee!

172
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:25,598
Ho Yee...

173
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:38,075
Stay with me...

174
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:41,551
Wake up...

175
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:45,052
Please!

176
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:48,916
You've been accused of helping
someone to impersonate an officer...

177
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:51,290
and bombing the police department

178
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:52,791
They're all aroused by your matters private

179
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,284
You're under arrest!

180
00:25:01,035 --> 00:25:02,935
Give me a cigarette, sir

181
00:25:03,304 --> 00:25:05,431
Quit, you'll get cancer

182
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,375
Don't worry, they'll let you go

183
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,671
You did it to yourself

184
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:18,307
What are you doing?

185
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,546
Our lawyer Come here

186
00:25:20,955 --> 00:25:21,944
What's going on?

187
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:26,651
We fear police harassment

188
00:25:27,161 --> 00:25:28,185
We're here to I.D. hi m

189
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,425
The SP okayed this

190
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,655
Inspector Chan

191
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:37,227
How's your girlfriend?

192
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:41,539
We'd like to visit her

193
00:25:43,978 --> 00:25:46,742
Go near the hospital and I'll kill you

194
00:25:47,181 --> 00:25:48,808
What are you trying to do?

195
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:53,147
Should we also charge him with...

196
00:25:54,121 --> 00:25:55,179
threatening us?

197
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:56,478
Of course

198
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:01,024
To be honest, we hate you stinking cops!

199
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:06,657
We're robbing another bank tonight

200
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,330
The game continues

201
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:15,467
Joe Kwan, I'll personally get you

202
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:18,736
Anytime

203
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:22,944
After you get out

204
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:42,296
The bank is on the top floor
with $100 million cash

205
00:26:44,071 --> 00:26:45,163
It's show time

206
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,275
Let me make a call

207
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:52,843
I want to make bail

208
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:55,909
Sorry, can't help you

209
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,243
I want to get them too

210
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:01,877
Sasa

211
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:03,979
What's up?

212
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:08,618
Well?

213
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:11,654
I couldn't

214
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:13,490
Heartless!

215
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:16,165
Try to get me out...

216
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,162
or many will die tonight

217
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:20,464
How?

218
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:22,835
I'll have to kill him
if I want to break you out

219
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,032
Tell me how!

220
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:26,802
Think of something!

221
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:36,879
Dad told me to join the police...

222
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:40,925
because they are righteous

223
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:45,162
Tomorrow I quit

224
00:27:45,532 --> 00:27:48,865
I don't want to see my Dad again

225
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,364
I'm going to the toilet

226
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:04,017
Dad, you go so often

227
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,480
Are you sick?

228
00:28:15,229 --> 00:28:16,594
Come with me Okay

229
00:29:00,474 --> 00:29:02,499
They can't see me

230
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,680
Bring it back when you're done

231
00:30:11,245 --> 00:30:12,234
Thank you

232
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,841
Oh, my god! I've died and gone to heaven!

233
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:22,286
In a game, new directions
are given at each level

234
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:23,917
They are crazy

235
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:27,226
If we win the game...

236
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:29,689
we'll find the next target

237
00:30:44,311 --> 00:30:45,835
Mission complete, Terrorists neutralized

238
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:47,375
I did it! Yeah!

239
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:56,778
Bank of Hong Kong?

240
00:30:57,624 --> 00:30:58,613
It's in the Convention Center

241
00:31:00,394 --> 00:31:01,952
Whatever you do...

242
00:31:02,396 --> 00:31:03,920
keep our men away

243
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:12,360
Call the police

244
00:31:16,143 --> 00:31:17,804
Don't be afraid. Just call the police

245
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:28,076
Big guy

246
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,144
What?

247
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,381
Hong Kong police; we need...

248
00:31:32,526 --> 00:31:34,391
your telescope

249
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:43,358
There they are!

250
00:31:44,605 --> 00:31:46,038
Do you have a phone?

251
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,198
Let me use it, thanks

252
00:31:50,377 --> 00:31:52,004
999 emergency

253
00:31:52,246 --> 00:31:53,713
Sasa, make some calls for me

254
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,381
Hurry, I can't hold them off

255
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,381
They will trace my line

256
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,584
Just make those calls

257
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:05,614
Inspector Chan!

258
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:08,683
Stop them!

259
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:15,626
We'll raise the stakes

260
00:32:16,336 --> 00:32:18,463
Double points for hitting each cop

261
00:32:20,407 --> 00:32:23,240
Joe, there are so many people down there

262
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:25,773
Do we still shoot?

263
00:32:35,355 --> 00:32:37,255
Don't panic the crowd.
Get them out, one by one

264
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:39,950
Please come, miss

265
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:43,224
Miss...

266
00:32:43,764 --> 00:32:44,753
Please come here

267
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,140
Something's wrong, Joe

268
00:32:58,412 --> 00:32:59,401
We'd better go

269
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,407
Shut up!

270
00:33:02,749 --> 00:33:03,977
Fire, over there

271
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:13,815
Mom and Dad?

272
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,462
Why are they here?

273
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,006
So many cops? Where's your son?

274
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:34,235
What's going on? Do you see them?

275
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,473
Where is my son?

276
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:37,878
Up there, robbing the bank

277
00:33:39,086 --> 00:33:40,280
Robbing? Impossible!

278
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:43,250
My son is a robber?

279
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,924
I'll give you $1 million to kill my dad

280
00:33:48,962 --> 00:33:51,590
$2 million to kill mine

281
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,288
Here is Convention Centre

282
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,558
One by one, come in

283
00:34:05,078 --> 00:34:06,067
There he is!

284
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:07,535
Max, come back!

285
00:34:09,416 --> 00:34:10,883
Come back, Max!

286
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:12,143
Max!

287
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:13,875
Max, come back!

288
00:34:15,322 --> 00:34:16,619
Max, where are you going?

289
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:27,325
Stay calm!

290
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:32,363
Son!

291
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:36,474
Are you okay?

292
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:59,523
Go!

293
00:35:04,638 --> 00:35:05,627
Chan!

294
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,807
Don't go there, call the SDU

295
00:35:15,348 --> 00:35:16,337
Inspector Chan?

296
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:31,546
Joe, I've been shot! Help!

297
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,059
I don't want mom and dad to see me

298
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,895
Go...

299
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,220
Last time we tied; let's go again

300
00:37:12,999 --> 00:37:14,193
Okay

301
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:23,531
Run!

302
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:47,024
Come on!

303
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:17,352
Come!

304
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:35,536
Come!

305
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:15,877
You lose

306
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:02,726
Police! Drop your weapons!

307
00:40:50,183 --> 00:40:52,413
Damn it!

308
00:40:58,825 --> 00:41:00,315
Hands on your head!

309
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,549
Get down!

310
00:41:02,061 --> 00:41:03,050
I'm a cop!

311
00:41:03,363 --> 00:41:04,352
Get down!

312
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:10,491
Who are you?

313
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:13,301
I'm Senior Inspector Chan

314
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,771
Someone's been shot! Call an ambulance!

315
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,499
Who is he?

316
00:41:20,346 --> 00:41:24,544
He's bleeding badly, save him!

317
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,383
He's dying

318
00:41:28,888 --> 00:41:30,185
Hurry!

319
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:32,914
It's really Chan!

320
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:35,116
Call an ambulance!

321
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:38,352
Freeze!

322
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:40,618
Okay

323
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,620
Drop your gun

324
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:53,394
Joe, give up, you're surrounded by cops

325
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:55,963
Really?

326
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,541
I'm not afraid

327
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,274
I'll take you both with me

328
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:12,454
But I'm not a cop!

329
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:16,422
If you kill me, you'll still lose

330
00:43:16,763 --> 00:43:18,628
Joe, you don't hate the police

331
00:43:19,332 --> 00:43:21,664
You hate your dad and yourself

332
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:26,728
Shut up!

333
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:28,033
Your friends are dead

334
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:31,804
No one else should die

335
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,372
It's game over

336
00:43:36,249 --> 00:43:37,944
I don't lose, I've never lost

337
00:43:38,084 --> 00:43:39,551
I want to play one last game

338
00:43:39,752 --> 00:43:40,912
You're on!

339
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:43,544
The rules?

340
00:43:43,823 --> 00:43:47,850
Same game, for his life!

341
00:43:53,032 --> 00:43:55,899
I accept

342
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:44,950
You're my man

343
00:44:51,891 --> 00:44:52,880
Call it

344
00:44:53,092 --> 00:44:54,081
Go

345
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,464
Joe!

346
00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:33,723
What are you doing?

347
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,963
Control yourself!

348
00:45:38,204 --> 00:45:40,798
You've totally embarrassed me

349
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:41,929
Joe!

350
00:45:43,543 --> 00:45:44,532
Give up

351
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:46,478
How can I live this down!

352
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,548
Drop your gun!

353
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:53,416
Son of a bitch!

354
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:59,388
Drop your gun!

355
00:46:00,593 --> 00:46:02,959
Trash!

356
00:46:05,865 --> 00:46:08,197
You're killing me!

357
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:11,465
You will ruin me!

358
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,433
Son of a bitch!

359
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,534
Give up!

360
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:25,547
Drop your gun!

361
00:46:25,718 --> 00:46:26,776
No!

362
00:46:59,252 --> 00:47:00,549
His gun is empty!

363
00:47:04,223 --> 00:47:08,956
Son...

364
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:43,083
Hold on!

365
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:21,566
You're letting me go!

366
00:48:22,134 --> 00:48:23,658
I know!

367
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,298
Hold on tighter!

368
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:29,604
I won't let... you...

369
00:48:29,842 --> 00:48:31,104
drop

370
00:48:50,162 --> 00:48:52,653
You said you'd hold tighter!

371
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,359
You try it!

372
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,565
I suffer more than you!

373
00:48:58,137 --> 00:48:59,126
Thanks, everyone

374
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:02,674
Inspector Chan...

375
00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:06,872
At least untie me!

376
00:49:09,348 --> 00:49:10,975
Ho Yee, you're recovered

377
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:13,179
You're discharged now

378
00:49:13,486 --> 00:49:14,475
Bye

379
00:49:14,587 --> 00:49:15,576
Be happy

380
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:16,644
Rest well

381
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:23,083
Goodbye

382
00:49:23,129 --> 00:49:24,118
Goodbye

383
00:49:30,503 --> 00:49:32,198
Salute!

384
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:48,046
Don't hide your face, no matter what,
I want to marry you

385
00:49:48,487 --> 00:49:51,012
Marry Inspector Chan!

386
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:10,567
Marry him!

387
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:19,845
How touching!

388
00:50:53,386 --> 00:50:54,375
Let's go

389
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:56,043
Where to?

390
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,746
Take my statement

391
00:50:58,624 --> 00:51:00,023
At my proposal...

392
00:51:00,259 --> 00:51:01,783
I want even more police

393
00:51:02,628 --> 00:51:03,617
How about phony ones?

394
00:51:04,196 --> 00:51:05,185
That'll do

395
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:26,343
What's up, Tsuen?

396
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:28,515
I've been here over a month

397
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:30,986
My wife is waiting for news from me

398
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:36,354
I'm broke; I need a loan

399
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:38,052
You promised...

400
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:52,399
Dad

401
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:55,170
I'm hungry

402
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:04,250
Wait here Frankie

403
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:18,392
Stop!

404
00:52:19,205 --> 00:52:20,194
Run!

405
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,898
Run!

406
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:24,075
Call the police! Thief!

407
00:52:24,143 --> 00:52:25,132
Run!

408
00:52:25,177 --> 00:52:26,166
Quick!

409
00:52:26,345 --> 00:52:28,210
Freeze!

410
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:29,574
Run!

411
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,849
Dad...

412
00:52:41,894 --> 00:52:43,953
You rotten thief

413
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,019
Inspector Chan

414
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:48,429
Thieves have dignity too; get an ambulance

415
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:50,090
Yes, sir

416
00:52:58,544 --> 00:52:59,533
Kid

417
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,879
This is the way of the world,
it's full of injustice

418
00:53:04,016 --> 00:53:06,541
Many things can make you sad

419
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,282
Forget the past, when you
grow up be a good man

420
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:11,879
Okay?

421
00:53:19,665 --> 00:53:21,030
What's your name?

422
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,029
I'm Frank Cheng
