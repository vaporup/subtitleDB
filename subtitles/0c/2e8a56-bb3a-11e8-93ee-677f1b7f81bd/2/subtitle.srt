1
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:33,607
Bitch!

2
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,434
You're not aware of what your
officers have done?

3
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:58,867
How dare you to treat me, the Chief
of the Royal Guards, like a soldier?

4
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:02,371
Besides, this affair is
none of your concern.

5
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:06,212
Do you mean Her Majesty
ordered Jaunbie to be killed?

6
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:09,040
- I did not say that!
- Then, did you?

7
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,849
I know Jaunbie's father was a rebel.

8
00:01:13,455 --> 00:01:15,719
You might fool Her Majesty
with your fake loyalty

9
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:17,890
but I know your dark intentions.

10
00:01:18,427 --> 00:01:23,364
It terribly worries me that you're
in Her Majesty's good graces.

11
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,761
General!

12
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:14,541
Did you order Jaunbie to be killed?

13
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:17,077
What are you talking about?

14
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,885
One of your Royal Guards
tried to kill her.

15
00:02:20,322 --> 00:02:21,448
I don't understand.

16
00:02:21,523 --> 00:02:23,491
Your Majesty, you have no
connection with this incident?

17
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,128
Your anger soars to the skies.

18
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:30,898
- Put down your sword!
- You have or you have not?

19
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:46,608
How dare you to march in here
with a sword in your hand?

20
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:50,882
Throw away your sword!

21
00:02:56,558 --> 00:02:57,786
Get her!

22
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:13,032
Close the gate!

23
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:35,655
That way!

24
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,704
Kill her!

25
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:20,455
Away with you.

26
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,027
So...

27
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,368
did you find out whose doing?

28
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,164
Please punish me for my disloyalty.

29
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:38,435
I could punish you for treason.

30
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:44,015
However, I could understand the
circumstances that you're under.

31
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:48,420
Keep your mind at ease and rise.

32
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,756
Your Majesty.

33
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,971
I've thought about you every moment.

34
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:16,943
Biharang.

35
00:08:07,402 --> 00:08:08,562
Who are you?

36
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:10,429
Where is Biharang?

37
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:12,531
Biharang!

38
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,007
Guards!

39
00:08:22,951 --> 00:08:24,043
Guards!

40
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,279
Guards!

41
00:08:29,491 --> 00:08:30,890
Did you not hear me?

42
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:47,840
Your people do not change
even after 1000 years.

43
00:08:48,443 --> 00:08:51,412
Trying to take away the only
thing that is left!

44
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:09,254
Starting with you, I'll eliminate
every living thing on this land.

45
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:40,389
The dead does not belong in a living
body! Come out of her at once!

46
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:51,430
Kill her!

47
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:41,549
Jaunbie...

48
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,723
She's no longer Jaunbie!

49
00:11:03,145 --> 00:11:04,237
Talwi!

50
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,958
The Great Emperor of Shilla,

51
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:26,425
with this Sacred Sword, may
the evil spirit be defeated!

52
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:22,047
Biharang!

53
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,484
Talwi!

54
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:37,323
Talwi!

55
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:01,813
General!

56
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:15,429
Jaunbie!

57
00:14:19,407 --> 00:14:20,567
Jaunbie!

58
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,307
- What are you doing?
- Put away your sword.

59
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,950
- General, she's the evil spirit!
- Talwi!

60
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:32,152
She's not Jaunbie.

61
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:34,285
If we don't kill her now, we
cannot destroy the evil spirit.

62
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:37,017
She's Jaunbie.

63
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,258
I can tell by the way
she looks at me.

64
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,863
- General!
- Believe me this once.

65
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:47,200
We don't have much time.

66
00:14:52,574 --> 00:14:55,941
How can she possibly resist the
monstrous power of the evil spirit?

67
00:14:57,379 --> 00:14:58,676
She's over there!

68
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:04,210
Talwi!

69
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:07,915
Get her!

70
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:32,004
Get him!

71
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,483
That deceitful peasant girl must've
approached Biharang

72
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:22,914
to get to you, Your Majesty.

73
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:25,618
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

74
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:28,961
However, since Biharang
protected her,

75
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:31,928
perhaps, they planned this together.

76
00:17:32,734 --> 00:17:37,865
Then they are rebels! We must
order them be caught and be killed.

77
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:43,407
First, we must find their hideout.
What happened with Talwi?

78
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,479
He's not saying a word.

79
00:17:47,515 --> 00:17:51,611
Your Majesty, since this is a critical
time, we should hold a trial.

80
00:17:54,022 --> 00:17:55,284
A trial?

81
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:15,966
Why don't you talk? You shouldn't
be enduring all these sufferings.

82
00:18:16,244 --> 00:18:17,575
It's not even your fault.

83
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,710
I did not fulfill my duty of
serving my general.

84
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:25,684
So, kill me.

85
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,292
Master!

86
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,420
Master!

87
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,203
I can't believe you sucked out the
poison from his wound.

88
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,886
It will protect you.

89
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,009
My promise of protecting
the 1000 year sovereignty

90
00:22:11,212 --> 00:22:13,077
was a futile promise.

91
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,945
I couldn't even protect you...

92
00:22:26,527 --> 00:22:27,755
Jaunbie.

93
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,222
General.

94
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:36,664
I've been having nightmares.

95
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:38,865
Do not be worried.

96
00:22:40,274 --> 00:22:43,732
You'll feel better when you
get some sleep.

97
00:23:05,566 --> 00:23:06,624
Drink.

98
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:21,607
I also hope for the safety
of Gen. Biharang.

99
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:29,420
I greatly honor your loyalty to your
general. However,

100
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,456
what if

101
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,992
Jaunbie truly is the evil spirit?

102
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:45,104
What if Biharang has been
bewitched by the evil spirit?

103
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:51,001
What if all was a devious
plan of the evil spirit?

104
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:55,277
It could've been its evil plan to
bewitch Biharang from the beginning.

105
00:24:00,855 --> 00:24:03,085
It's sad.

106
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:07,126
Who would help him
in his time of troubles?

107
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,363
Talwi will lead us. Hurry.

108
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:50,665
Yes, Your Majesty.

109
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,314
She just fell asleep.

110
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,020
Tonight, a bloody moon that holds
the hatred of 1000 years, will rise.

111
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,861
When the darkness hides the moon,

112
00:25:21,902 --> 00:25:24,132
the evil spirit will regain
its full strength.

113
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:29,372
Then, even the Sacred Sword
will be powerless.

114
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,479
Then what about Jaunbie?

115
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:42,415
If you could keep her away from the
moon, you might be able to save her.

116
00:25:43,557 --> 00:25:47,186
Since her desire to be
with you is so great.

117
00:25:48,362 --> 00:25:51,456
If I can't keep her away, then what
would happen to her?

118
00:25:51,766 --> 00:25:54,166
She'll be nothing but an empty shell.

119
00:25:55,302 --> 00:26:00,365
It would be Jaunbie outside, but
she'll be Auta inside.

120
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:07,714
We must sacrifice one life
to save millions.

121
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:08,934
Jaunbie!

122
00:27:13,614 --> 00:27:15,241
I'm scared.

123
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:18,111
Jaunbie!

124
00:27:32,366 --> 00:27:34,163
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

125
00:28:17,378 --> 00:28:21,280
It's too late for me. You must
go and save the General.

126
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:24,279
He's at the lake.

127
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,410
Hurry!

128
00:28:34,795 --> 00:28:35,989
Let's go!

129
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:02,781
General BANG has left the palace
to kill the evil spirit.

130
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:05,689
- Did he bring any men with him?
- Only about 100 men.

131
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,219
And Her Majesty followed
him in secrecy.

132
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:25,677
Lead the way. I'll meet with
Biharang personally.

133
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,542
Yes, Your Majesty.

134
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:08,016
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!
You must fight it off!

135
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:33,304
Jaunbie!

136
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,042
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

137
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,076
Jaunbie!

138
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,247
General...

139
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:13,845
If I can't be who I was again,

140
00:31:15,055 --> 00:31:19,355
I want you to kill me yourself.

141
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:46,482
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! You must fight!

142
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,878
Jaunbie!

143
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:51,449
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Please!

144
00:31:55,229 --> 00:31:57,356
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

145
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:06,630
Jaunbie!

146
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:10,068
Jaunbie!

147
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,948
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

148
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:29,721
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

149
00:32:30,764 --> 00:32:31,890
Jaunbie!

150
00:32:46,346 --> 00:32:48,337
Your Majesty, I'll go look first.

151
00:33:03,931 --> 00:33:05,865
Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

152
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:10,896
Jaunbie! Jaunbie! Jaunbie!

153
00:33:12,372 --> 00:33:13,498
Jaunbie!

154
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,476
Jaunbie!

155
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:34,084
General...

156
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,653
Jaunbie!

157
00:33:38,832 --> 00:33:41,926
Master! Are you ok?

158
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,963
It's all over.

159
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:50,366
The evil spirit will take over
the Kingdom of Shilla.

160
00:34:54,174 --> 00:34:55,334
- General!
- Biharang!

161
00:35:35,415 --> 00:35:37,713
Here is the mighty general.

162
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:40,510
Where did you hide her?

163
00:35:41,154 --> 00:35:42,849
I can defeat the evil spirit.

164
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,953
Just give me more time.

165
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,495
Draw!

166
00:35:55,569 --> 00:35:57,696
I'll kill anyone

167
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:00,598
who gets in my way.

168
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:11,975
Stop!

169
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:20,493
General BANG! Whose order
were you following

170
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:22,790
when it was not I who ordered
you to shoot Biharang?

171
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,492
Withdraw!

172
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,936
Biharang!

173
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,672
Biharang!

174
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,229
Your Majesty, I cannot bear to
watch this with my own eyes.

175
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,928
Destroying your own country for
a shallow passion.

176
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,267
You're no different from
a bitch in heat.

177
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:08,007
How dare you to plot treason!

178
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:13,572
General BANG!

179
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:26,324
This is Her Majesty. Put down
your swords.

180
00:37:29,396 --> 00:37:34,732
I pity your girl. She should've died
when she was supposed to.

181
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:38,664
It was YOU!

182
00:37:46,113 --> 00:37:47,205
General BANG!

183
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:12,762
What are you waiting for?
Kill them all!

184
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:05,943
Your Majesty!

185
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:08,012
Is there any way we can destroy
the evil spirit?

186
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,251
It's hatred is too great
for us to bear.

187
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,887
So the 1000 year sovereign of
Shilla must end here?

188
00:41:23,463 --> 00:41:24,691
How about the Sacred Sword?

189
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:28,167
The one that the Great Emperor used
to seal off the evil spirit.

190
00:41:28,368 --> 00:41:29,960
It no longer has any power.

191
00:41:30,637 --> 00:41:31,865
If not the Sacred Sword...

192
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,603
Then, can I do nothing but just
watch my kingdom fall apart?

193
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,657
Jaunbie.

194
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,244
Jaunbie!

195
00:42:24,524 --> 00:42:25,582
It's me!

196
00:42:26,526 --> 00:42:27,584
Please come back.

197
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:29,253
Please.

198
00:42:52,652 --> 00:42:54,882
I do not know how great
your hatred is,

199
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:57,920
but I'll take the blame for all.

200
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,690
Let go of Jaunbi.

201
00:43:01,928 --> 00:43:05,659
Take me instead! Take me!

202
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:46,098
General!

203
00:43:53,179 --> 00:43:54,271
Talwi!

204
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:57,208
Talwi! Talwi!

205
00:44:05,158 --> 00:44:06,591
It is not her.

206
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:15,099
Let her rest... in peace...

207
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,435
Talwi! Talwi!

208
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:23,534
Talwi!

209
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,046
If it was a sin for a queen of
one country to love a man,

210
00:44:36,823 --> 00:44:40,054
then take me instead.

211
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:42,786
My people are innocent.

212
00:45:15,028 --> 00:45:17,622
Stab her heart!

213
00:47:28,027 --> 00:47:29,358
General.

214
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,056
Jaunbie.

215
00:48:02,428 --> 00:48:07,127
Thank you.

216
00:48:37,764 --> 00:48:38,992
Biharang!

217
00:51:05,044 --> 00:51:08,036
6 month after Queen Chinsong left
the throne to her nephew Yoh,

218
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,072
she died in The North Palace.
38 years later,

219
00:51:11,117 --> 00:51:13,779
the thousand year old
history of Shilla came to an end.
