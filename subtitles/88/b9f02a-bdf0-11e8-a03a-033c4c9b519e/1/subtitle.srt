1
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,425
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

2
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,229
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

3
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,225
Have you called the police yet?

4
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,890
It's not my fault.
Have you called the police?

5
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,489
It's not my fault...

6
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,659
Have you?

7
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:56,928
It's not my fault.

8
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,333
I have.

9
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,299
It's not my fault.
He rushed the traffic lights.

10
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:06,539
Hold on, bro.

11
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:08,375
The ambulance's coming.

12
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,891
Help!

13
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:27,764
How're you, bro?

14
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,693
Cell phone...

15
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,496
Cell phone...

16
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,938
Here you are.

17
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,450
Battery?

18
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,224
I'll fix it for you.

19
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,032
What's the number? I'll dial it for you.

20
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,853
Kirk... What's wrong?

21
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,756
The driver of 1314 has an accident!

22
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,418
What should we do?

23
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,621
Where's Elvis? I don't know.

24
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,924
Call him now!

25
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,577
Man, I was so worry about you.

26
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,044
Where're you?

27
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,581
Man...

28
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,175
Man? Hello...

29
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,984
Man...

30
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,160
Who are you looking for, ma'am?

31
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:42,359
Man Liang.

32
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:43,264
What's your relationship to him?

33
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,028
Fiancee.

34
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,570
Wait a minute.

35
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,170
Is that her?

36
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,007
He had brain bleeding.

37
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:54,773
We tried our best but can't make it.

38
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,483
No... no.

39
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,678
I think you've made a mistake.

40
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,483
He just gave me a call.

41
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,648
I think you really must've made a mistake.

42
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:10,922
Sorry.

43
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,520
No... This can't be... it cannot be him.

44
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,190
He just called me.

45
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,392
It must be you guys who made a mistake...

46
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,662
Please check it again, will you?

47
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,702
Ma'am, please stay calm.

48
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,136
C'mon.

49
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,900
I'm calm. But you've made a mistake.

50
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,635
That guy is not him!

51
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,274
Why are you here, Hale?

52
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:27,906
How is it?

53
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:28,911
It's alright.

54
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,482
Let's go there.

55
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:31,777
Here.

56
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,748
Doctor... Who are you looking for?

57
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,919
The driver of 1314... we're friends.

58
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:45,455
No... impossible...

59
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,398
He's just given me a call.

60
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,003
Ma'am it's the destination.

61
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,016
Isn't the North Street your destination?

62
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,812
How do you know that?

63
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,955
I usually give you a ride.

64
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,521
You're so "ugly". Who would forget you?

65
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:17,460
I wanna listen to this song.
Can I get off later?

66
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,394
Sure.

67
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,034
I can give you the CD,

68
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,001
OK? Great.

69
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:27,466
Maybe it's not such a goof idea.

70
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:29,734
You can listen to the song whenever
you catch my ride anyway.

71
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,668
What's the matter?
You ran away from home?

72
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,573
It's dangerous for a girl
to wander around so late.

73
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,914
Tell me your address. I'll take you home.

74
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,156
Isn't it... more dangerous?

75
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,557
Though I look like a playboy,

76
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:49,923
I'm a good bloke.

77
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,621
Look at my face...

78
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,101
Wait a minute. I pick up my boss home.

79
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,464
Hello.

80
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,701
You're off? Yes.

81
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,277
Thanks.

82
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,545
What's wrong?

83
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,446
Wanna eat something?

84
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,518
Let's go.

85
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,954
Do you like kids? You may play with him.

86
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,353
Whose baby is this?

87
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,522
Stupid question.

88
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:27,895
This smart baby must be my son.

89
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,287
Spacious!

90
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:00,660
Definitely.

91
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:02,395
You wouldn't believe this...

92
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:03,866
An old lady who usually catch my ride.

93
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,301
She walks like my mum,

94
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:07,031
so I helped her to get on and off.

95
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,299
Later we became friends.

96
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,136
When she knew I wanna rent a flat,
she showed me this.

97
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:10,970
Guess the rent.

98
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:11,668
How much?

99
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,301
Just three thousand something.

100
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,644
So nice guys always get rewards.

101
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,217
It's near the stop.
It takes less time for you to travel.

102
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,343
But it costs a lot.

103
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,649
Money is not a problem,
as long as this is a nice place.

104
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,484
Where should we put our sofa?

105
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:26,615
This kind of difficult design work...

106
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,353
it's better to leave it for your decision.

107
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,156
Sofa in beige colour

108
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,559
and wall sky blue.

109
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,598
Colourful curtain. Like a rainbow.

110
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,927
It makes you happy when you look at it.

111
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,059
You own my minibus.
You keep my passbook.

112
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:39,069
After getting married,
you can't return them to me.

113
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,230
When will you tell your dad?

114
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,999
I don't want to get into a scrap with him.

115
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:42,836
What?

116
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:43,909
I don't want to get into a scrap with him.

117
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,411
Well... I'll invite him to come
for a dinner later.

118
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,174
It's me who tell him
about our wedding, OK?

119
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,537
Talk about this later.

120
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,118
Or let's try... the new room.

121
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,446
There's not even a bed.

122
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,452
No problem. I've never tried new poses.

123
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,812
Laurie. Time to go to school. Get changed.

124
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,511
I'll take you to a restaurant for breakfast.

125
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:29,679
Get changed.

126
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,484
I'll take you to restaurant
for breakfast, okay?

127
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:34,488
Laurie, remember... work hard.

128
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:36,493
Put the books into the bag.
Listen to the teacher, OK?

129
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,186
You can't be late for school, Laurie.

130
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,559
Get changed.

131
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,021
Where's your bag?

132
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,328
I've told you... don't put the bag
in the wrong place.

133
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,599
Where're your slippers?

134
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,401
Wash up. Be quick!

135
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,250
Ma'am, your money.

136
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,029
Have hair cut or washed, ma'am?

137
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:23,666
It's moved?

138
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:24,936
It's the next shop.

139
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,073
Hello. Miss Lam.

140
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,778
Please sit.

141
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,727
I give you a bag, Miss Lam.

142
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:50,199
Thanks.

143
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,426
Hello?

144
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,997
It's mum.

145
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,326
I've told your dad that

146
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,491
You and Man will come back
for a dinner tonight.

147
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,000
Do come back.

148
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:26,298
He's only long-winded.

149
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,396
Hello... are you listening to me?

150
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,236
Man's dead.

151
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,866
What?

152
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,979
He died in a traffic accident.

153
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,789
Holly...

154
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,963
How are you? Are you OK?

155
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,273
Holly...

156
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:04,438
Come on.

157
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,911
Don't stay in the street. Go back.

158
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,241
Jesus...

159
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,721
I can't cry.

160
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,888
It's ex gratia payment.

161
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,281
Thank you.

162
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,021
I gotta work. Take care.

163
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,768
I was just on the scene.

164
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,944
It was me who called you that night.

165
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,980
I hung up as I saw you
come to the hospital.

166
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,553
It's me.

167
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,047
What's your name?

168
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:25,384
Laurie.

169
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,459
Sir?

170
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,497
Just call me Hale. I go now.

171
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,298
Thanks Welcome.

172
00:15:58,524 --> 00:15:59,786
Laurie.

173
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,098
What's that?

174
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,365
Laurie the good boy,

175
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,332
let's put it into the niche together.

176
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,471
Don't open it.

177
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:25,917
It's daddy.

178
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,051
Yeah, he's dead.

179
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,678
Dead?

180
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:32,188
What is 'dead'?

181
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,351
It's... going on a trip.

182
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,699
Are they all going on a trip?

183
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,670
Why don't they take us with them?

184
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,636
Don't ask this kind of question.

185
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,212
Holly, I don't think it's good for you

186
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,287
to take care of Laurie...

187
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,552
It's alright, dad. Please take care of mum.

188
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:09,226
You also take care of yourself, Holly.

189
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,694
Mum, don't worry. I'm fine.

190
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,025
Come in.

191
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,661
Come here, Laurie.

192
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:27,738
It's pretty good.

193
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,115
Honey, come have a look.

194
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,386
Grandma.

195
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,689
Good boy...

196
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,593
Your dad and sis come see you.

197
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,192
We've worked together
for a long time, Peter.

198
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,534
It's not about the problem of trust.

199
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,742
Ye know... there're a lot of deceivers.

200
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,203
If you aren't firm,
don't get me into the troubles.

201
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:01,074
Bankruptcy is possible!

202
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,756
Laurie's a good boy.

203
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,061
Congratulations.

204
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:20,158
When did you become a grandma?

205
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:21,857
OK. That's it.

206
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,059
What's up?

207
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:25,363
Tell Helen: don't send him the cheque.

208
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,904
Your friend's not reliable.

209
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:31,373
What are you going to do now?

210
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,009
Go back to your room, Laurie.

211
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:40,978
I'm talking to you!

212
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:42,314
Fine.

213
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:44,149
What?

214
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,053
I mean what will you do?

215
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,955
Calm down.

216
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,385
Are you gonna raise that kid?

217
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,895
Yeah.

218
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,356
You've made up your mind.
No need to care about you, right?

219
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,490
Any problem?

220
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:57,626
We may go then.

221
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,363
Stay calm. Let's discuss this issue.

222
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,666
Sit down...

223
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:04,272
There's no need to discuss any more.

224
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,005
Let's go, dad.

225
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,910
Sharon...

226
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,314
Holly, how can you go on like this?

227
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,651
Anything to be discussed? She's great.
No need to worry.

228
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,984
Or talk about Laurie's issue with his mum.

229
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,387
Ask her to take care of him.

230
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,959
Let's go. She doesn't want us to interfere.

231
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,186
I'll wait for you downstairs.

232
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,023
Wait a minute...

233
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,991
Honey...

234
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:34,462
Honey...

235
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:37,440
Keys, mum.

236
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:40,836
Don't be like this.

237
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:42,880
I'll make some soup

238
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:43,948
or do the cleaning for you.

239
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,573
Keys.

240
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,812
NO WAY!

241
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,892
I got it repaired, Hale. Have a look.

242
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:06,868
The mirrors and walkie talkie
have been removed.

243
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,337
The worn tyres are also replaced.

244
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,169
You're truly a vampire.

245
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,667
This minibus's useless.

246
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,041
Excuse me. Who's Charles?

247
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,145
Yeah.

248
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,740
Miss Lam? Charles

249
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,285
I want to get this minibus repaired.
How much is it?

250
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:23,721
Get it repaired?

251
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,756
It's better to replace it.

252
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:26,949
Maybe the engine still works.

253
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,027
But this minibus isn't lucky.

254
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,490
Don't bullshit.

255
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,224
Go to work...

256
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,664
Charles

257
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,270
Can you make it the same as before?

258
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:42,840
Well... miscellaneous included...

259
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,602
a hundred and ten thousand or more.

260
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,904
So expensive?

261
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,410
No.

262
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,003
Isn't there insurance?

263
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,213
Yeah...

264
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,046
But you have to pay
thirty thousand something first.

265
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,120
And thirty thousand something
for loading next year.

266
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,916
Maybe no insurance company
will accept the application.

267
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,820
It doesn't make sense.

268
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,132
Charles, how about eighty thousand?

269
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,433
Eighty thousand? No way.

270
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,912
Eighty thousand. No more bargain.

271
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,948
No way.

272
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,045
Well I'll call a tow company to tow it away.

273
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,317
Alright...

274
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:32,515
This time it's me who bear the cost.

275
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,591
I'll give it a try

276
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,125
Thanks and I want it to look
just the same as before.

277
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,441
Master! Please adjust the clutch pedal
to a higher position.

278
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,206
I have to fully step on it
to shift the gear. Too slow.

279
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,804
You car-racing?
Let me have a check first.

280
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,816
Hurry up. Gotta work.

281
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,909
OK. It's alright.

282
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:10,851
What's the matter?

283
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:11,820
Forget to bring the tea leaves.

284
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,618
You go to restaurant first
and I'll take the tea leaves.

285
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,413
I got it repaired. It's like brand new.

286
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:11,539
Thanks, Charles.

287
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:12,810
Thank you.

288
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,411
Lease it out?

289
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,284
No, I'll drive it on my own.

290
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,652
Well...

291
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:26,996
You are in the gear...

292
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:29,662
And fasten the seatbelt.

293
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,346
Which horse should we bet on?

294
00:24:44,883 --> 00:24:46,248
Have a drink.

295
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,318
Thanks.

296
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:48,750
Welcome.

297
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,249
Who's this?

298
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,324
A woman.

299
00:24:57,596 --> 00:25:00,622
Stop!

300
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:04,065
Hale, you're in "good luck".

301
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,397
Loudmouth.

302
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,369
Sorry. I didn't hit it on purpose.

303
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,670
I know. It doesn't matter.

304
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,607
That night... thanks.

305
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,182
It was a petty matter.

306
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,443
You're looking for somebody?

307
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,382
Yeah, I want to see Elvis.

308
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,882
Elvis, can you do me a favour?

309
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,256
Sit down.

310
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,827
What's the matter?

311
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,956
I want a place for the route
from this terminus.

312
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:35,555
Are you kidding?

313
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,596
I have a minibus driving license.

314
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:39,767
But you've never driven minibus.

315
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,372
I can manage.

316
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:41,996
I know...

317
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,473
But somebody has taken Man's place.

318
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,710
Just an extra vehicle.

319
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:49,177
If I had say, I wouldn't be
the terminal co-ordinator.

320
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,749
Well I'll talk about this with the boss.

321
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,444
But you have to pay for the place. It's a rule.

322
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,020
Man's paid for it.

323
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,055
But the sum is by head count not vehicle.

324
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,283
It's around a hundred thousand something.

325
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,526
But I don't have so much money.

326
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,426
You can be a freelancer.

327
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:08,363
You can run any routes.
See it as paid training sessions.

328
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:10,497
Thanks.

329
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,967
Welcome.

330
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,638
You go?

331
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:22,039
I reverse to make way for you.

332
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,442
Go away or she might hit you.

333
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:50,769
What?

334
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,899
Two inches left...

335
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,877
Tell all the bros:
stay away from this woman.

336
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,781
Look. What's she doing?

337
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,585
Ma'am, you stole the minibus?

338
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,018
Got a driving license?
Need some guidance?

339
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,818
Come with me and I'll teach you how?

340
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,760
Come have a chat. C'mon.

341
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,591
Wait!

342
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,095
Have a chat!

343
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,437
Laurie, c'mon.

344
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,899
Eat them all. Don't waste them.

345
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,111
Enough? I give you more.

346
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,050
You're hurt?

347
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:49,117
Wear daddy's gloves.

348
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,063
Good boy. Now finish it.

349
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,969
Laurie, work hard.

350
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,669
And aunt will earn more money

351
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:08,837
and buy you more toys, OK?

352
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,312
I'm late.

353
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:31,936
Bitch. How come you overtake
in this way!

354
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:49,414
Ma'am, the sign's wrong.

355
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,021
Thanks.

356
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:57,753
Christ, late again!

357
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,160
Can you hurry up a little bit? I'm in a rush.

358
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,804
Look. The tram's faster than you.

359
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,905
Yeah, Please hurry up.

360
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,339
Got it.

361
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,689
How do you drive?

362
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,354
Sorry...

363
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,959
I don't have any change.

364
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,459
It doesn't matter.

365
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:10,665
Clearway! What?

366
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,395
Get off!

367
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,132
What's the matter, sir?

368
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,800
No stopping.

369
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:19,934
No stopping?

370
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,978
Clearway!

371
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:22,836
Here's a clearway?

372
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,812
7 a.m. to 12 a.m.!

373
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:26,109
Driving license.

374
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,115
Give me a chance, sir.

375
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,845
Driving license!

376
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,989
Still here? Forty-five minutes passed.

377
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,198
Poor.

378
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:05,614
Five hundred. Fuel, miscellaneous...

379
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:08,518
and a ticket.

380
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,121
Three hundred and twenty... My God.

381
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,665
Bastard! That bloke in suit...

382
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:22,267
What's the matter?

383
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:25,537
What're you doing, Laurie?

384
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,474
You break the pipe.

385
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:29,978
Get up. Quick.

386
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,710
Laurie, go to bed on your own.
Be a good boy.

387
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,691
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

388
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,358
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

389
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,395
Daddy, I'm going to bed.

390
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,369
When'll you be back?

391
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,634
I miss you so much.

392
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:00,472
And aunt's driving is really poor.

393
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,636
She drives very slowly.

394
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,279
Goodnight, daddy.

395
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:47,356
You look familiar, ma'am.

396
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,052
You used to run taxi service?

397
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,159
I seldom see such a young girl
running minibus service.

398
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,431
You like driving?

399
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,866
I want to hire a driver.

400
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,938
Want to work with me?

401
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,596
That's enough. Sit down.

402
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,730
So annoying!

403
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,400
I really want to hire a driver.

404
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,038
Be my driver...

405
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:07,907
Leave me alone!

406
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,549
Get off now!

407
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:23,321
This is too much!
You throw up on my bus?

408
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,520
Why are you so fierce?

409
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,994
Go!

410
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,343
Cross the harbour? Get on the bus.

411
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,284
Cross the harbour? Yeah.

412
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,446
Get on.

413
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,019
Hey...

414
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,559
You can't load passengers here!

415
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,094
I'm going now...

416
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,389
Sorry.

417
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,362
Please catch the next ride back.

418
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,629
Next ride back. Sorry.

419
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:07,865
Are you crazy?

420
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,961
If you'd been a man, I'd have hit you.

421
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,531
Go away!

422
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,110
Go!

423
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,872
I'm not available at the moment.
Please leave a message.

424
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,276
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

425
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,046
Man...

426
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:29,148
I miss you.

427
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,154
Can you hear me?

428
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:41,694
Laurie...

429
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,824
Good boy. Help dad clean the vehicle.

430
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:46,563
Look at your grubby hands.
Give me your hands.

431
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,263
You'd said it's easy to run minibus service?

432
00:36:51,275 --> 00:36:53,038
The passengers scolded me...

433
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,242
The cops gave me a ticket...

434
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,637
those gangs kicked me out...

435
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,142
And I received a fake note.

436
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:03,551
Why can't I take the passengers
at the terminal?

437
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,922
Tell me... what to do.

438
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,022
Well... Goodbye.

439
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,856
It's only the first day. Not used to it yet

440
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,056
I can manage.

441
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,029
It won't be late.

442
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:16,963
Wait for me at the terminal.

443
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,868
Take a rest. Tomorrow's another day.

444
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:24,400
I can manage.

445
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,686
That woman is really unbearable.

446
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:43,851
She has no ideas
about the signs and signals.

447
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,860
The taxi driver behind
blew horn to rush her.

448
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:47,362
She's nearly got lost.

449
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,626
She's so skinny and
still worked for two shifts.

450
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:50,598
She did?

451
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:51,599
Sure

452
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,329
Big Fool saw her last night.

453
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,428
Even us feel exhausted
after driving twelve hours.

454
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,370
How can she stand a job like this?

455
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:58,442
That's the point.

456
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:00,305
Do me a favour. Help her.

457
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,309
Crazy.

458
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,476
His fiancee's died just recently.

459
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:05,105
Women need comfort.

460
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,810
Don't say this, OK!

461
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:08,816
Her boyfriend's just died.

462
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,149
She needs to pay the minibus mortgage
and raise Man's son.

463
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,979
Isn't she the mother of the child?

464
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,320
No. Man was divorced.

465
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,257
This lady's pretty good.

466
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,396
Sorry. May I ask you a question?

467
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,644
You were on the scene
of Man's accident, right?

468
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,015
Did he tell you anything?

469
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,953
Not a word?

470
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,152
He seemed to tell me...

471
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,755
He said, "tell her to be stronger.

472
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,527
Don't be too sad."

473
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,598
Maybe he wanted me to tell you these.

474
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,401
Then he asked me
to pick up the cell phone.

475
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,907
He might want to call you.

476
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,179
But he didn't make it.

477
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,280
How was he at that time?

478
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,886
Was he very painful?

479
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,057
It was just a short while.
I don't think he suffered much.

480
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,766
Thanks.

481
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:31,800
Not at all.

482
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,082
Excuse me. Please make way for me.

483
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,313
I need to drive the vehicle away.

484
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:52,889
There's enough room.

485
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,516
I'll help you.

486
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:56,857
Thanks.

487
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,070
These roads are narrow. Give it back later.

488
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,334
Thanks.

489
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,911
Why do you start with second gear?

490
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,341
It's too slow to use bottom gear for start.

491
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:23,045
We normally use it on the slope...

492
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:25,418
or for our own vehicle.

493
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:28,921
Bottom gear start reduces
the vehicle depreciation.

494
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,219
If you're on the same row with an 'enemy',

495
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,854
waiting for the green light
to hunt for the passenger,

496
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,190
you have to use second gear.

497
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,201
Hunt for passengers...

498
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,497
No hunt, no passengers, right?

499
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,298
That's true.

500
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,532
Remember: wait for the amber light

501
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,438
but do rush when it's alight.

502
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,970
And don't brake hard.

503
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,878
Otherwise, the passengers get hurt easily.

504
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:56,009
And this makes the vehicle behind
brake hard too

505
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,213
or it may crash your vehicle.

506
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,483
Running minibus service isn't as easy
as I think.

507
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:08,258
Have you learnt how to run the service?

508
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:13,901
I... caught Man's ride before.

509
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,072
Well...

510
00:41:19,777 --> 00:41:21,836
I show you once. Be careful.

511
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,045
As a beginner, you must learn the signs,

512
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,621
recognise the routes and

513
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,981
remember the clearways and loading zones.

514
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,253
This sign, no loading during
the periods of 8 a.m. to 10 a.m...

515
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:39,886
So many restrictions.

516
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:40,994
But rules and practice

517
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,725
are different.

518
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:44,761
Do remember this sign.

519
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,667
No stopping at any time.

520
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,299
No loading at any time in this zone.

521
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:54,309
Turn to another street
for loading and unloading.

522
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,675
But those old passengers
should know this.

523
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,159
Be hawk-eyed.
Unload passengers if needed.

524
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:11,751
No loading, then accelerate.

525
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,261
The faster the ride, the more the rides.

526
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,264
The more the rides, the more the earnings.

527
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,105
Watch out!

528
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,108
It's always for the giant to bully the tiny.

529
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,905
No need to fear those taxi drivers.

530
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,741
Just drive close to them.

531
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,474
Scare them and they must make way
for you.

532
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,687
Just give them a scare
but don't really crash into them.

533
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,881
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

534
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,854
Look...

535
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:42,755
Crazy!

536
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:48,096
That idiot calls a minibus in the red routes.

537
00:42:48,198 --> 00:42:51,133
If you wanna load this passenger,
look the mirrors first

538
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,361
to make sure there're no cops.

539
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,403
No cops. It's safe.

540
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,234
Then go for it.

541
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,137
Hurry up, it's red route.

542
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,177
Take a seat...

543
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,347
Look out!

544
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:06,711
Are you OK?

545
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:11,784
Get off in the next mouth.

546
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:14,047
Please alight beyond the clearway.

547
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,857
Loading only in the clearway.

548
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,790
It ensures an earning.

549
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,157
Unloading may bring you a ticket.

550
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,355
Too risky.

551
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,931
Who pities you?

552
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:23,895
A passenger.

553
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,004
Hey... you've missed that!

554
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,006
Sorry. Only a bit farther.

555
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,810
Forget about the horn and

556
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,976
complaints.

557
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,314
Why do you run your service like this?

558
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,157
Passengers will understand
your difficulties.

559
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,248
They won't make any troubles for you.

560
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,459
Anyone get off ahead? Gotta paid first.

561
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:56,590
Yeah.

562
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,156
Thanks.

563
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:04,040
Any one get off before the red route?
No stopping there

564
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,547
And if there are cops stopping you,

565
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,640
pretend you're not seeing them.

566
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:14,911
Gamble on fleeing the chase.

567
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,850
If not, beg for a chance.

568
00:44:16,954 --> 00:44:17,886
It's easy for a woman to make it.

569
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:21,151
Soft tone and sweet smile.
You'll surely make it.

570
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:23,156
But I failed every time.

571
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,251
Weep then.

572
00:44:25,362 --> 00:44:27,296
Weeping is the best weapon of women.

573
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:29,559
The cops let you go if they pity you.

574
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,603
Thanks.

575
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:45,642
Your profit is three times more than mine.

576
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:46,579
I'm lucky this time.

577
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,675
I broke the record when
I started to run minibus service.

578
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,253
No passenger for whole-day rides.

579
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,353
Hello? Yeah.

580
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,786
I'll come over now.

581
00:44:56,293 --> 00:44:57,920
My son has a fever.
I must pick him up now.

582
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:58,722
Then your turn.

583
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:01,696
No, you're faster. It's near the terminus.

584
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:03,426
OK. Thanks.

585
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,094
Are you OK, Laurie?

586
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,102
Why are you so late?

587
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,399
Take him to see the doctor.

588
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,734
Sorry.

589
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,370
Aunt.

590
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,546
Come here!

591
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,612
I gotta work.

592
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,053
I got something to tell you!

593
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:28,716
Can you take care of him for a moment?

594
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,192
Just tell me what you want...
once and for all.

595
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,697
I don't want you drop in so suddenly.

596
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,528
Are you crazy?
You really run a minibus service?

597
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:39,898
Can you stop it?
How can you go on like this?

598
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:42,233
Man's gone and the story's over.
You still keep his son?

599
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:43,806
That's enough. Don't say this, OK!

600
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,307
If Man had been alive,
we would've got married

601
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,139
and Laurie would've been my son.

602
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,803
I'll do my best. I'm not that kind
of person like you.

603
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,205
You can't live off on your own.

604
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:52,714
How can you keep the kid?

605
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:53,880
So what?

606
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:54,746
Leave him or

607
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,046
send him to an orphanage?

608
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:57,677
How about his relatives?

609
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,412
His grandparents only live off
social security. Besides, his grandma's sick.

610
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,788
How about his mum? Where's she?

611
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,722
To be pragmatic, Holly.

612
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,295
You're an adult.
Don't play this kind of romantic game!

613
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:07,454
Look at you.

614
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,429
You look pallid!

615
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,967
None of your business.
I don't bring any troubles for you, right?

616
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,230
Just as I don't think in the same way
like you do.

617
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:18,865
I don't need any luxury cars

618
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,068
nor clothing.

619
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,109
I'm still happy.

620
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,338
Is money the only thing on your mind?

621
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,278
Don't talk about me!

622
00:46:25,382 --> 00:46:27,475
I earn money not just for myself.

623
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,848
Who supports dad after he retired?

624
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,750
You spend on the monthly installment,

625
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:34,255
rent and the kid.

626
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,258
Have you given a buck to the family?

627
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,257
You think of the kid.

628
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,626
Why don't you think of your parents?

629
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:42,129
You're selfish!

630
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,030
I tell you, don't ask mum for money.

631
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,228
That means she can only
give you the money?

632
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,899
I take the money for investment,
not spend it.

633
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:53,900
What 'spend it'?

634
00:46:54,044 --> 00:46:55,341
What're you looking at?

635
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:56,810
She's so fierce.

636
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,211
You know it?

637
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,407
Yeah.

638
00:46:59,917 --> 00:47:02,044
Then am I fierce?

639
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,577
Yes or no...

640
00:47:09,393 --> 00:47:11,452
He really has a fever.
Need to visit the doctor now!

641
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,127
Who's he?

642
00:47:16,066 --> 00:47:16,896
If you go on like this,

643
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,490
both the kid and you will die.

644
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:30,071
What's the matter?

645
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:32,615
OK. Just park it aside.

646
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,144
Alright.

647
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:35,547
Let me carry him.

648
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:37,643
It's alright. He's heavy. Let me carry him.

649
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:38,721
Thanks.

650
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,659
Good boy...

651
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,196
Good boy, take some medicine...

652
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,892
Listen to me, good boy...

653
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:53,763
Don't move or it spills out.

654
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,851
Meal's ready, Laurie."

655
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,516
Come.

656
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:15,782
Eat the soup. Thanks.

657
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:17,155
It's hot. Be careful.

658
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:26,202
Salty and sweet... is it OK?

659
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,394
How's the soup? Seems a bit salty.

660
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,405
No, it tastes good.

661
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,499
Your clothes got dirty.

662
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:33,405
Is that... I help you.

663
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,034
No, I can do it myself.

664
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,607
Eat it.

665
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,069
Go to bed yourself after dinner, okay?

666
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:02,569
Your sink pipe got blocked.

667
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,798
Yeah. I've cleared it many times
but still can't fix it.

668
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,069
Buy a drain cleaner.

669
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,700
What? Drink cleaner?

670
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,507
No, D.R.I.A.N. Drain cleaner.

671
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,741
I can help you clear it when I'm available.

672
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,009
Thank you.

673
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,813
I take you to the terminal.

674
00:49:17,187 --> 00:49:17,983
No.

675
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:19,988
I live in the place nearby.
Take care of the child.

676
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,183
He goes to bed on his own. It's OK.

677
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,782
You leave him alone at home?

678
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,557
What's wrong?

679
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,664
Oh... I forget to make him some milk.

680
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,234
You may go first if you are in a hurry.

681
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,573
He isn't a baby any more.
Still use baby milk bottle?

682
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,610
Yeah, it's his late night refreshment.

683
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,545
I think...

684
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,019
it's difficult... for you to go on like this.

685
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,356
I know you have sentiment on the minibus.

686
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,618
But if you lease it out,

687
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:56,818
you can put more effort on Laurie.

688
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,724
No, I'm not familiar with any drivers.

689
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:02,026
What if they crash the vehicle
or go away with it?

690
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:06,234
Frankly speaking,
do you know how to calculate?

691
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,737
I guess you repay the mortgage
of the vehicle.

692
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,899
Even if it's your own vehicle.
Renting it out is a must.

693
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,204
Two shifts a day. A thousand.

694
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,371
Rent, fuel and tickets...

695
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,073
How much can you earn?

696
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,747
And also the license fee, insurance,
maintenance...

697
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:22,910
Brake system replacement
at 3-month interval

698
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,817
and tyres 4-month.

699
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,023
Everything needs money.

700
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,750
If you don't do the calculations,
how can you make a profit?

701
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,521
And also the tickets.

702
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,988
If you got more points incurred,
you're disqualified.

703
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:37,123
You can't count on running
a minibus service then.

704
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,901
With money, you can pay the rent,

705
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,528
tuition and food.

706
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,575
Your sis may be right.

707
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,939
Why are you all the same?

708
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,949
Why do you all...
do calculations on everything?

709
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,384
I believe I can manage.
I don't need your help.

710
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,690
Sorry,

711
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,056
I'm loudmouth.

712
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,798
I'm leaving now. Bye.

713
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,515
Boss, prosperous business?

714
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,084
See. Buy two more fishes.

715
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:37,091
You really sell the biz to me?

716
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:38,058
Yeah, I've told you.

717
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:38,820
So, you do? Keep your promise.

718
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,489
I do. No reason to deceive you, right?

719
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,506
It's more comfortable here.

720
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,942
It was like in the jail just now.

721
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,304
C'mon.

722
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,083
Have a chat each other.

723
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,685
Don't get into fight.

724
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,732
Hale, barbecue again?

725
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,966
Join me for barbecue.

726
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,934
No, I already had a date.

727
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,670
Do come with your friends.
The ribs are pretty good.

728
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:29,972
Maybe next time.

729
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,691
Hello... Who's calling?

730
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:45,621
He's not available at the moment.

731
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:01,903
Hale, gimme a call at once.

732
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,305
Laurie, come on. We back home.

733
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,802
You brought him together during the rides?

734
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:38,171
Yeah.

735
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,277
Let me carry him.

736
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:40,508
Thanks.

737
00:53:43,253 --> 00:53:44,811
Two hundred and sixty-two.

738
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,453
No tickets. Less the rent and fuel,

739
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,253
I earn two hundred and sixty-two.

740
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,419
Pretty good. Let's go.

741
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:05,532
You're awake?

742
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,934
I'm hungry.

743
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,636
I cook for you

744
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,145
Here comes the meal.

745
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:16,812
It's hot. Be careful.

746
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,152
I got you a night-shift driver.

747
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:47,813
Go to bed.

748
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,714
What's your name?

749
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,276
Hale.

750
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,447
What should I call you?

751
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:55,080
Whatever you like.

752
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,620
How about Hale?

753
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:58,586
I'm old enough to be your dad,

754
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,253
still call me Hale?

755
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,930
Uncle Beard?

756
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,564
What if I don't have beard?

757
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,262
What'll you call me?

758
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:09,930
Lucky.

759
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,065
What? Lucky?

760
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,870
Lucky is a puppy's name.

761
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,671
Go to bed, good boy.

762
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:23,085
How about your mum?

763
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,513
No idea. Maybe she's on a trip.

764
00:55:28,792 --> 00:55:30,657
Do you miss your daddy?

765
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:34,093
Yeah, I miss him so much.

766
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,426
Why does the TV work again?

767
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,028
Lucky got it repaired.

768
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:17,239
Who's Lucky?

769
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,706
That is Hale.

770
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,505
He also did the curtain, right?

771
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,046
Don't know.

772
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,887
The mirror isn't clear.

773
00:56:39,262 --> 00:56:41,025
Do you get the right spectacles?

774
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,727
Sorry, I got the wrong pair.

775
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,670
Can he manage? I'm worried about him.

776
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,763
It's difficult to find such a reliable driver.

777
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,240
He hands you the minibus on time
and refill the fuel.

778
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,810
Ma'am...

779
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:58,039
Don't think I'm an idiot.

780
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,682
I raise four children
with the minibus service.

781
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,342
They all got a university degree.

782
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,611
It's boring to stay at home all the time.

783
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,780
So I just wanna kill time.

784
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,457
Hand over at 3 p.m.
He'll park the vehicle outside your home.

785
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,252
Thank you, Uncle Chiu.

786
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:13,727
OK. Bye.

787
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,061
I go to work now.

788
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,408
Hale, do me a favour to raise my son too.

789
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:29,541
Iced lemon tea. Got it.

790
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:31,509
You help her only. It isn't fair to me.

791
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,946
Hale dress up and got shaved.

792
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,814
You're gonna get her soon.
Still pretend to be cool?

793
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,452
Shut up.

794
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,182
Hale, let's place a bet for 3T together.

795
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:42,588
He has given up on gambling
for a long time.

796
00:57:42,692 --> 00:57:44,717
Besides, he needs to saves money.

797
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:45,583
That's it.

798
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:47,754
The economy is halted.
Always got a free gift whatever you buy.

799
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,424
A widow with a son as a gift.
No need to pay for the napkins.

800
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,329
Yeah

801
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:52,366
What're you talking about?

802
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:55,131
Just kidding. What's wrong?

803
00:57:59,008 --> 00:57:59,838
You wanna make troubles?

804
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,706
Hale...

805
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,109
You think you're still well-off?

806
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,375
Still got vehicles for lease?
That's not the case!

807
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,950
Look at you! What did you say?

808
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:08,949
Relax. Just minor business, right?

809
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:09,814
Don't fight over this.

810
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,114
Get on board...

811
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,213
Go. Set off!

812
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:39,579
The tyres have worn out.

813
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,172
Two seats left. Get on.

814
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,382
Come on!

815
00:58:44,721 --> 00:58:46,154
You steal my passengers!

816
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,690
Another ride.

817
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,757
The tyres have worn out.

818
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,061
Have you called the tow service?

819
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,033
It's expensive.

820
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:02,803
Please help me change it.

821
00:59:04,941 --> 00:59:06,238
Can't make it.

822
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:07,809
Why?

823
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,879
Trust me. Replace the tyres in the garage.

824
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:11,412
Please hurry up.

825
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:14,046
Watch out and go back to the pavement.

826
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,173
Ma'am, this doesn't work.

827
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,748
Take it to the garage.

828
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:55,554
Hello?

829
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,717
Hello. Has your vehicle been on tow?

830
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,094
Yeah, thanks.

831
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,159
Where're you?

832
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,865
At the terminal.

833
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,698
Can you pick Laurie up?

834
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,736
I can't make it on time.

835
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:11,399
Yeah, I'll go now.

836
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,735
Bye.

837
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:14,742
Sorry. Ladies and gentlemen,

838
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,311
please get on the next ride.

839
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:17,674
Sorry...

840
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:20,813
What's the matter?

841
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,312
Hale...

842
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,027
See you tomorrow.

843
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:34,024
See you.

844
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:46,601
Sir, you're...

845
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:47,902
Are you Miss Cheung?

846
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,280
I'm... a friend of his family.
I'll help take him home.

847
01:00:51,714 --> 01:00:53,682
Laurie, who's he?

848
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,244
Lucky.

849
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:58,653
I'm a friend of his mom's.

850
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:01,815
But it used to be his dad
who took him home.

851
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,824
My dad died.

852
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,765
Are you crazy?

853
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:15,663
Sir...

854
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:18,263
Please tell his family.

855
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,171
They haven't paid the tuition fees
for two months.

856
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:24,204
Have you taken Laurie home?

857
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,178
Not yet. I want to take him out.

858
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,681
Don't you have to work?

859
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:30,309
I want to take a rest.
I'll bring him home later.

860
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,217
That's fine.

861
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:34,580
You bought my tuition fee?

862
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,353
Not 'bought' tuition fee.
I 'paid' your tuition fees.

863
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,223
Could you buy me an ice cream?

864
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:41,921
Sure.

865
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:43,396
What favour do you like?

866
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,074
Watch out.

867
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,254
Did uncle buy you all the gifts?

868
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:08,852
Where's Uncle Chiu?

869
01:02:09,459 --> 01:02:12,155
I've thought about it.
It's better to drive it myself.

870
01:02:12,261 --> 01:02:13,728
Why?

871
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,959
I can get more and save more
from driving by myself.

872
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,470
You made the soup?

873
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,484
What...

874
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,111
Did I forget to pay the tuition fee?

875
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,516
I've paid it for you.

876
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,049
I'll give it back to you.

877
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,353
Take your time.

878
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:46,257
By the way, I've fixed your sink.

879
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,864
Save your money, man.

880
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,403
It's OK.

881
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:57,601
I bought them for your kid only.

882
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:04,173
What? Are you OK?

883
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:07,875
OK.

884
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,447
Miss Lam, my mom send me
to collect the rent.

885
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,954
Don't worry. I'll pay you soon.

886
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:20,994
No way...

887
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,190
You've held it off month after month.

888
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,561
I fear no bad tenant!

889
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:26,327
Miss Lam,

890
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,302
you know the elders live on rent.

891
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:31,635
Don't worry, I'll pay you after two days.

892
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:34,539
OK. I'll wait till that day but no more.

893
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,407
I'll come next Monday.

894
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:38,344
Don't hold it off any more at that time.

895
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:46,283
Don't worry. The landlady is kind.

896
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,414
It's her daughter who's troublesome.

897
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,650
She fears that I can't pay the rent.

898
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,557
I work so hard.
How can I make no money?

899
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,262
If I hadn't blown the tyre today,

900
01:03:56,365 --> 01:03:58,492
I would have made it.

901
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:28,520
Eight dollars for crossing the harbour.
Hop in!

902
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,098
Eight dollars only, get in.

903
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:31,325
Hop in!

904
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:33,298
Damn, stop!

905
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:34,394
Stop!

906
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:35,231
Open the door!

907
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:40,332
How dare you! Stop...

908
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,214
Damn it! I'll dig you up.

909
01:04:48,751 --> 01:04:50,218
Where did the clunker 1314 come from?

910
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:51,877
It seemed to come from Eastern District.

911
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,079
Good. Anyway,

912
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,952
tell our men to get her tonight!

913
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:55,682
Got it!

914
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,163
You snatched the passengers
from their turfs?

915
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,304
I'll settle it for you.
Take the kid to school first.

916
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:47,603
What're you doing?

917
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,506
I'm calling the police.

918
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,545
Are you nuts? Can it help?

919
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:51,908
Do you know them?

920
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,777
I'll revenge if I do.

921
01:05:54,216 --> 01:05:56,150
How do you revenge? Kill him?

922
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,586
Where did you go last night?

923
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:00,120
How dared you snatch the passengers
from their turfs?

924
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:01,917
They all have triad backgrounds!

925
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:03,889
They ruin my business.
I'm starving to death!

926
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,223
All professions have their own rules.
You must obey them.

927
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,694
I believe there's justice in the world.

928
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,855
See them with me!

929
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,863
I'm not tough like you.

930
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,900
Go by yourself. I won't go with you.

931
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,591
You only act by yourself!

932
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,104
Hey!

933
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:37,583
Bitch!

934
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,362
Which bastard wrecked my car?

935
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,158
Me! What can you do?

936
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:43,890
How dare you push me?

937
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,558
Is money the only way to go?

938
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:47,301
I wanna earn my bread and butter only.

939
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:47,926
Yeah!

940
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,402
I 'Il call the police to nail you. I swear it!

941
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,598
Don't push me any more. I warn you!

942
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:53,732
Kill me! If you dare!

943
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:54,502
Stay here if you have the guts!

944
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:56,043
Kill me!

945
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:57,610
Don't run away!

946
01:07:00,783 --> 01:07:01,442
Shau Kei Wan. Hurry.

947
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:01,914
What's with you?

948
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,315
Don't do anything rash. OK?

949
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:04,909
Listen to me this time. Alright?

950
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:06,885
I'll settle it for you!

951
01:07:20,002 --> 01:07:21,196
Listen...

952
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:24,204
Let me do the talking.
Don't do anything rash.

953
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,136
I'll try my best.

954
01:07:30,913 --> 01:07:31,971
Uncle Seven.

955
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,908
Elvis, you're here.

956
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:34,914
Wanna play mahjong?

957
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:35,813
Come on. Let's...

958
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:36,577
I'll take a rain-check.

959
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:38,846
Uncle Seven, I'd like to talk with you.

960
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,320
My granddaughter is holding
a birthday party tonight.

961
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,282
Talk to me tomorrow.

962
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,689
Sorry, Uncle Seven. Just for a while.

963
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,465
What's the matter?

964
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:55,969
You know, Man was killed in the crash.

965
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:57,903
His wife wanna take the route for him.

966
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:58,699
That's her?

967
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,036
Yes.

968
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,106
I have told you

969
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:02,199
not to queue up.

970
01:08:02,311 --> 01:08:04,302
She can take the route once she pays.

971
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:04,902
I know. Uncle Seven.

972
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,505
But she's got no money.
So we wanna ask for your help.

973
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,242
No money... you two may help her out.

974
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,755
And she's really gutsy.

975
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,827
If she keeps buggering around,

976
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,589
you'll be in big trouble one day! Got it?

977
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:21,628
I must drive to the terminus.

978
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,697
Terminus?

979
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:23,890
Your man died, and I have to pay you?

980
01:08:23,999 --> 01:08:26,126
Then, what if dad dies,
his son asks for help?

981
01:08:26,235 --> 01:08:27,600
And what if an older bro dies?
Free for his younger bro?

982
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,728
Can I still make a living?
Absolutely not!

983
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:31,397
I must drive to the terminus.

984
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,668
Dad,
today's your granddaughter's birthday.

985
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:35,607
Cut anything about death!

986
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,348
For your goodies.

987
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:57,529
Kiddo, you're so cute.

988
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:58,964
How old are you?

989
01:08:59,068 --> 01:08:59,727
Five.

990
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:00,802
Five only?

991
01:09:00,903 --> 01:09:01,665
Granddad!

992
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:03,067
Good gal.

993
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:04,734
Laurie Leung.

994
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:06,330
Charlene Cheung.

995
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:08,307
I'm celebrating my birthday today.

996
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,378
My auntie wanna drive to the terminus.

997
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,538
For what?

998
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:13,979
I don't know.

999
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,516
Play with me.

1000
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:17,117
I love to.

1001
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:21,084
Uncle Seven, they're friends.

1002
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,817
They may become very close friends
one day.

1003
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:24,984
Yes, it's man who sets the rules.

1004
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:26,322
You can always change them.

1005
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:30,159
My boy, a dozen grand only.
You can help them.

1006
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,858
Spare her the charge, please.
Uncle Seven.

1007
01:09:32,968 --> 01:09:34,697
That's right.
You'll be rewarded for your good will.

1008
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:35,633
Right? Auntie.

1009
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:37,103
Auntie? How do you do?

1010
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:38,605
OK, well...

1011
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,231
I make an exception this time and not next.

1012
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:44,044
All set. What got you into a fuss?

1013
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,408
I've told you not to worry.

1014
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,106
You're just lucky today.

1015
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,183
To tell the truth, those guys...

1016
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:50,115
are only bluffing. They're just wusses.

1017
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:51,652
I am never scared.

1018
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:53,788
Shush.

1019
01:09:54,123 --> 01:09:55,488
If they reject me,

1020
01:09:55,591 --> 01:09:57,525
I'll ask them to return Man's money to me.

1021
01:09:57,626 --> 01:09:58,991
Right, Laurie?

1022
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:00,652
You're nuts! OK...

1023
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,458
I'll go to the market and buy some food.
Let's celebrate tonight.

1024
01:10:03,966 --> 01:10:05,092
It's late now. Save it.

1025
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:08,935
Where are you going?

1026
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:13,634
Sir, any shrimps and crabs?

1027
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:14,834
All sold out!

1028
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,071
Then... any fish?

1029
01:10:17,613 --> 01:10:18,637
Can't you see fish?

1030
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,214
I sell you all for 30 dollars.

1031
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,418
I can't take all these. Too many for a meal.

1032
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,077
Two sets are enough.

1033
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:28,553
This fish... can you make it into a dish?

1034
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:30,955
I can pan-fry it to make it a good dish.

1035
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,827
The vegetable stall is closing.
Keep this for me.

1036
01:10:34,964 --> 01:10:36,989
Sorry, sir. I don't want it.

1037
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,658
How much is the cabbage?

1038
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:40,098
Five dollars for one catty.

1039
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:44,072
You don't want it?

1040
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,538
It is decaying. Dump it.

1041
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:48,201
Can you give it to me
if I buy two more catty from you?

1042
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,039
Take all home if you like.

1043
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:51,610
Thank you.

1044
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,653
I waste no food.

1045
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,355
Don't you know you're in a mess?

1046
01:11:09,698 --> 01:11:13,031
It's alright if you can't handle it.
Stop push yourself.

1047
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,463
It may be OK for a grown-up.
But how about the kid?

1048
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,402
If the days go like this,
you are raising him like a dog.

1049
01:11:17,506 --> 01:11:19,235
Is it OK to feed him, water him like a dog?

1050
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,172
I know you've been helping me a lot.

1051
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,837
And I don't want to cause you
any more troubles.

1052
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,005
I shouldn't ask for help all the time.

1053
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:28,283
It doesn't matter.

1054
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,545
But no one will sympathize
with you for good.

1055
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:34,453
I know.
I don't want to be a laughing stock.

1056
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,183
Didn't Man told you at the time of dying...

1057
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:38,055
that I must be tough?

1058
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,360
To be frank,

1059
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,824
Man at his time of dying
didn't tell me he loved you.

1060
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,459
He didn't tell you to be tough.

1061
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,367
That's my own words.

1062
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:03,250
Why did you lie to me?

1063
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,847
You cheated me!

1064
01:12:10,726 --> 01:12:12,353
I told you that...

1065
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:15,061
to help you, to make you feel better.

1066
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:21,666
But I might be wrong.

1067
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:13,518
I am very busy and cannot receive
your call at the moment.

1068
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:16,557
Please leave your phone number.
I'll reply you soon.

1069
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,867
Where's Laurie?

1070
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,762
His mom is dining out with him
for his birthday.

1071
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,936
I've thought about it.

1072
01:13:34,343 --> 01:13:35,207
If you think it's not easy,

1073
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,175
I'll ask his mom to raise him.

1074
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,610
No way.

1075
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,877
I love you but I love Laurie even more.

1076
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,780
It's hard to raise a child.

1077
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:47,012
Then, why did you fight for his custody?

1078
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,886
A woman can't marry
if she got a child with her.

1079
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,619
That's it.

1080
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:53,922
You can't dump even a dog like that.

1081
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:55,656
Do you agree?

1082
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,922
Yes.

1083
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:03,031
You've done a very good job.
No one will blame you.

1084
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:07,097
For me,
a wife is your solution to your troubles.

1085
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,711
You're right.

1086
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:13,140
Let me get one tomorrow.

1087
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,413
Marry me!

1088
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:17,845
Marry you?

1089
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,217
Will you do?

1090
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,448
I'll do if you say 'I do'.

1091
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,857
No. You'll do if I say 'I do'.

1092
01:14:26,728 --> 01:14:28,491
Will you say 'I do'?

1093
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:30,296
Scare me stiff.

1094
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:32,492
What? What scares you?

1095
01:14:32,601 --> 01:14:33,465
You know what scares me.

1096
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,627
I have a hard time raising my son.

1097
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:35,464
You'll add to my burden.

1098
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,506
No! You must marry me...

1099
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:08,336
Come up with a solution later.
Go to bed early.

1100
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:22,515
Susan...

1101
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,915
I know.

1102
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,249
I was not in Hong Kong. So...

1103
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:28,112
Are you available?

1104
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,187
I'd like to talk with you.

1105
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,191
I'm married.

1106
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:36,530
Why do you know my address?

1107
01:15:36,665 --> 01:15:38,496
His mom told you?

1108
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:40,765
I can't help you...

1109
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:42,027
I've brought him to dad and mom

1110
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,230
after Man's death.

1111
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,863
No... I saw them...

1112
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,033
I've paid them some grand.

1113
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,270
What're you up to?
Wanna bring him to me?

1114
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,370
No... I can't help you!

1115
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:55,844
At that time, I didn't want to have him.

1116
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:57,919
It's Man who insisted on having him.

1117
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,079
We've gone through all the procedure.

1118
01:16:00,188 --> 01:16:02,349
I know. But...

1119
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:11,260
Who are you?

1120
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:15,427
Take him back now, I beg you.

1121
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,672
You want money?

1122
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,971
Give me your account number. I'll pay you.

1123
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:25,012
Give me some time if you want a big sum.

1124
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:27,775
I'll try my best to discuss with my husband.

1125
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,977
I... I've got no money...

1126
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,048
Let's go.

1127
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,833
I'm so sorry.

1128
01:16:47,669 --> 01:16:50,160
I split up with Man right after his birth.

1129
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:52,539
I've seen him a few times only!

1130
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,345
Don't worry.

1131
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,955
I'll bring Laurie to see you when I'm free.

1132
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,224
Sorry.

1133
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,098
Do you mean that?

1134
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,205
Then tell me how can you deal with it?

1135
01:17:33,382 --> 01:17:34,872
Any other way out?

1136
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,353
So hungry. Get something to eat. Go.

1137
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:50,522
Let's get something to eat.

1138
01:17:58,707 --> 01:18:00,800
Sorry, I wasted your time.

1139
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,740
Any other relatives?

1140
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,275
They live on pension.

1141
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:09,407
His grandma got hurt
when she fell down last week.

1142
01:18:15,824 --> 01:18:18,452
For the Rent?
Or the instalments on the car?

1143
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,253
Let me lend you some money.

1144
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,563
No.

1145
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:34,942
Which one do you like?

1146
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:38,072
You may pick more.

1147
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,475
Really?

1148
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:49,419
Don't buy any more.
He'll get the clothes inside.

1149
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:51,151
Let's buy two.

1150
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,220
Laurie. Take one more.

1151
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:56,194
I'm full.

1152
01:18:56,298 --> 01:18:57,822
You have fed him three.

1153
01:18:57,933 --> 01:18:59,696
He used to love this goody. One more.

1154
01:18:59,801 --> 01:19:01,792
You wanna choke him on ice cream?

1155
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:06,071
Stop. He'll have loose bowels
with too many ice-creams.

1156
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:08,574
He can ease himself in the toilet.
He loves ice cream.

1157
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:09,905
One more. Good boy.

1158
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:10,602
Enjoy it...

1159
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,974
Orphanage

1160
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:20,414
Can you bring him in for me?

1161
01:19:20,522 --> 01:19:22,285
I can't!

1162
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:26,455
I can't. He'll hate me for good.

1163
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,693
I'd rather put your dog down for you.

1164
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,663
I can't.

1165
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,195
I can't.

1166
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,533
Laurie, let's go.

1167
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,069
Say goodbye to uncle.

1168
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:43,907
Uncle Hale won't go with us?

1169
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:55,923
Where do you want to bring me?

1170
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,254
I'll be a good boy.

1171
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,156
I'll listen to you.

1172
01:20:02,264 --> 01:20:04,198
Auntie can't keep you.

1173
01:20:04,566 --> 01:20:08,263
Don't give me up.
I don't know my way home.

1174
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,767
But I've got no way out.

1175
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:15,570
Laurie must be a good boy.

1176
01:20:15,677 --> 01:20:17,440
Beware of the bullies.
Take good care of yourself.

1177
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:19,070
I'll be a good boy.

1178
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,048
Don't desert me. Mom.

1179
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:28,485
I beg you. Take me to Dad and Grandma.

1180
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,619
Forgive me.

1181
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:39,367
Uncle Hale wanna keep me?

1182
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:45,130
Hale...

1183
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,336
Hale!

1184
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,773
Hey!

1185
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:56,307
What should I do?

1186
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,861
Can you really send him away?

1187
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:10,261
You should sell your minibus before him.

1188
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,066
Don't cry...

1189
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,330
Let me keep him, OK?

1190
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:17,871
I'll keep him!

1191
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,671
Come on. It's OK.

1192
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,443
Don't cry...

1193
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:31,246
Let's go. Go.

1194
01:21:33,154 --> 01:21:36,021
What will the others think
when they see us?

1195
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:40,354
OK. Let's go...

1196
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:42,396
Alright...

1197
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,028
Don't cry.

1198
01:21:47,035 --> 01:21:49,936
The kite's high in the sky!

1199
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:54,604
It drops.

1200
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,741
A fallen kite!

1201
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:22,968
Check out your throne.

1202
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,264
Come on. Belt up.

1203
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,376
Be careful.

1204
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,500
And this board.

1205
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:32,509
You can pull it down...

1206
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:36,448
to do homework, drawing...
so safe and comfy.

1207
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,643
Isn't it great? What's more...

1208
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:40,487
Laurie, you see.

1209
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:41,577
Thank you!

1210
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:43,385
I've got something for you, too.

1211
01:22:48,263 --> 01:22:50,424
Call her mom, not auntie any more.

1212
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:51,863
Why?

1213
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:54,060
Coz your auntie will be happy about it.

1214
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,500
Got it?

1215
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,899
My mom got it from the temple.

1216
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:01,937
It's great.

1217
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:03,704
And...

1218
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:06,838
I made a pack of keys for you.
It helps you see Laurie.

1219
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:08,677
Terrific.

1220
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:09,609
By the way, I've got an idea.

1221
01:23:09,718 --> 01:23:13,176
Laurie and you go live with me.

1222
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:15,017
And you no longer need to pay the rent.

1223
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:18,422
Come to my home when you're free.
It's a nice place.

1224
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,922
Let me think about it.

1225
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,594
Yes, think it over.

1226
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:25,257
Coz... if I move,

1227
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,835
it's wise to live out
the prepayment of two months.

1228
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:29,904
That's right. Think it over.

1229
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,600
I'll go now. You gotta work.

1230
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:33,898
Bye.

1231
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:34,600
Thanks a lot.

1232
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:35,971
You're welcome.

1233
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:40,945
Bye. Papa!

1234
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,313
Bye. Sit down.

1235
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,711
This kid's brainy and honey mouthed.

1236
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:54,091
What's up?

1237
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:58,356
You pay the instalments on the car
for someone?

1238
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:00,463
Who's bullshitting?

1239
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,902
There aren't many car companies around.

1240
01:24:04,973 --> 01:24:06,600
It's typically human.

1241
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:09,208
One tends to gossip about others
but not oneself.

1242
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,834
I just wanna help the kiddo!

1243
01:24:10,945 --> 01:24:13,675
Yes. You're right. But...

1244
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:14,908
Got it.

1245
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:16,313
What did you get? I haven't finished yet.

1246
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:18,181
I said I got it!

1247
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,150
It's good to give a helping hand,
but bad to overdo it.

1248
01:24:21,289 --> 01:24:23,450
What are the scruples
about helping people?

1249
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,322
I don't mean that. I mean...

1250
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,693
an existential subject may not be
an empirical one

1251
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:32,858
yet an empirical one may not be
a rational one, right?

1252
01:24:35,170 --> 01:24:37,070
You must have read
too many hentai comics.

1253
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:39,140
So, you talk like a philosopher.

1254
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:52,110
Watch out!

1255
01:24:53,054 --> 01:24:54,681
You coward.

1256
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,724
Aren't you gutsy? What scares you?

1257
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,589
Give it your hand.

1258
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:01,025
Let it shake with you.

1259
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,825
Come on, let it smell your hand
and know you're Laurie.

1260
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,336
He'll have a very good sleep
coz he played so tired.

1261
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,098
I go now.

1262
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,365
Hale.

1263
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:49,500
Let me go with you.

1264
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,171
Good idea.

1265
01:25:57,352 --> 01:25:59,445
Laurie hasn't played so happily
for such a long time.

1266
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,118
Me too.

1267
01:26:04,459 --> 01:26:05,892
Me too.

1268
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,097
Sorry.

1269
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:37,950
Let's get something to drink.

1270
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,590
Ma'am, six bottles of beer, please.

1271
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:42,458
Thanks.

1272
01:26:42,564 --> 01:26:44,293
You like it? I like it.

1273
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,397
Get more foodstuff.

1274
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:47,968
Fine.

1275
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:18,418
Who're you?

1276
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,158
I'm... a friend of Holly.

1277
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:23,457
What... what're you doing here?

1278
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:26,233
I'm... fixing something for her.

1279
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,060
It's fixed now.

1280
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:31,696
Thank a lot.

1281
01:28:33,708 --> 01:28:35,505
Holly and I are colleagues.

1282
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:37,434
You also drive a minibus?

1283
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:38,978
Yes.

1284
01:28:41,549 --> 01:28:43,312
I've made it. I'm leaving now.

1285
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:48,311
There're soft drinks in the fridge.

1286
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,057
Bye.

1287
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,924
Excuse me.

1288
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,070
You're with her?

1289
01:29:06,908 --> 01:29:08,398
Yes.

1290
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:12,203
How's she now?

1291
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:15,309
Quite good... Nothing wrong with her.

1292
01:29:17,885 --> 01:29:20,012
Do you know... her story?

1293
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:21,846
I know.

1294
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:26,959
Not long ago... she's so emotional that...

1295
01:29:27,061 --> 01:29:29,723
she couldn't make any good judgment.

1296
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:32,095
But she's quite good now.

1297
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:38,460
She looks tough.
But deep down she's dependent.

1298
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:41,699
And she's rash and headstrong.

1299
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,403
So her mom and I are worried about her...

1300
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:46,639
We feared that she'd be cheated.

1301
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:50,580
Would you please look after her for us?

1302
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:52,552
Don't worry. I would.

1303
01:29:53,187 --> 01:29:54,916
And...

1304
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,723
Don't tell her I've been here...

1305
01:29:56,824 --> 01:29:59,190
though it makes no harm
to tell her about her mom.

1306
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:02,385
I got it. I tell her nothing then.

1307
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:05,995
Thank you.

1308
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,465
Alright.

1309
01:30:42,804 --> 01:30:46,331
Hale, let's have buffet with Laurie tonight?

1310
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:47,736
Tonight?

1311
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,467
I have to work till eight or nine o'clock.

1312
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,302
It's OK. Laurie and I will be waiting.

1313
01:30:52,413 --> 01:30:54,438
Hale, go.

1314
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:56,548
I gotta go now.

1315
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:31,374
I am very busy and cannot receive
your call at the moment.

1316
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,009
Please leave your phone number.

1317
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,552
I'll reply you soon.

1318
01:32:12,093 --> 01:32:13,253
Laurie.

1319
01:32:15,196 --> 01:32:16,288
What's up?

1320
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,900
Let's call Uncle Hale.

1321
01:32:38,653 --> 01:32:39,620
Hello?

1322
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,015
Hello?

1323
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:46,491
Uncle Hale, I'm going to bed now.

1324
01:32:47,762 --> 01:32:49,195
Good boy.

1325
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,396
How's your mom?

1326
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,127
He wants you.

1327
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:03,306
He said he must call you.

1328
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:05,269
That's OK.

1329
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,212
Where did you go?

1330
01:33:11,752 --> 01:33:13,652
I've just taken a nap.

1331
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,790
I thought you wanted to turn
a blind eye to me.

1332
01:33:19,026 --> 01:33:21,017
Featherbrain. Why would I do so?

1333
01:33:24,832 --> 01:33:26,993
Then, I'll come and see you later.

1334
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,904
OK.

1335
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,617
What do you want?

1336
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:51,117
Beer?

1337
01:33:52,059 --> 01:33:53,526
Six bottles, please.

1338
01:33:53,628 --> 01:33:54,788
Thanks.

1339
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:12,307
How are you feeling? Not feeling well?

1340
01:34:12,446 --> 01:34:14,175
I'm fine. Alright.

1341
01:34:15,583 --> 01:34:17,949
By the way, I asked the landlady
to stop renting out her flat.

1342
01:34:18,052 --> 01:34:20,213
She only returned me
half of the prepayment.

1343
01:34:20,988 --> 01:34:23,252
We'll live with you.
If you feel uneasy with us,

1344
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,289
do tell me.

1345
01:34:24,392 --> 01:34:26,223
Don't be silly. How can it be?

1346
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:30,326
As the saying goes:
Two going well may not live well.

1347
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:33,295
You have been taking good care of us
these days.

1348
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:44,304
No matter how the days goes,

1349
01:34:44,645 --> 01:34:47,671
I'll be grateful to you. Thank you.

1350
01:35:06,767 --> 01:35:08,200
I have something to say.

1351
01:35:08,903 --> 01:35:11,565
Turn off the tap. Come over and listen.

1352
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:19,004
Hale, call me when you're back.

1353
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:24,111
Hale, I'm going to board a plane
with our son.

1354
01:35:24,218 --> 01:35:25,446
Keep on gambling.

1355
01:35:25,553 --> 01:35:27,748
I tell you you're not a good man

1356
01:35:27,855 --> 01:35:29,880
or a good husband, a good father.

1357
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:31,389
You don't need a home at all.

1358
01:35:31,492 --> 01:35:33,687
Why got married? Why had a son?

1359
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,056
It's too late to mend.

1360
01:35:35,162 --> 01:35:37,722
Good boy, say goodbye to dad.

1361
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:40,058
Dad! Why are you not with us?

1362
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:42,601
What's wrong?
I haven't done with my words!

1363
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:14,830
I begin to do housework only
after they left me.

1364
01:36:14,935 --> 01:36:17,062
Make a meal, sweep the floor...

1365
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:19,601
Stop talking foul languages before the kids.

1366
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:22,135
Save money, stop smoking, stop gambling...

1367
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:25,376
I used to have four minibuses. But all lost.

1368
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:28,381
I'm foolish enough.

1369
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:29,774
I cheated myself.

1370
01:36:29,884 --> 01:36:31,442
I know well they wouldn't come back

1371
01:36:31,552 --> 01:36:34,385
yet I make a spin
in my minibus every day...

1372
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,649
I daren't change my phone, move elsewhere

1373
01:36:36,757 --> 01:36:37,815
or change jobs.

1374
01:36:37,925 --> 01:36:39,825
I fear that they can't see me any more.

1375
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:42,293
The truth is, if they do want me,
they'll see me.

1376
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:46,765
I got real at last.

1377
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:49,097
I should face reality, forget the past

1378
01:36:49,203 --> 01:36:50,795
and not stay put.

1379
01:36:50,905 --> 01:36:51,769
I can't spend my life in...

1380
01:36:51,872 --> 01:36:54,568
driving from east to west, then back to east.

1381
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:55,869
Right?

1382
01:36:58,712 --> 01:37:01,078
Last time, I told Laurie
and you to live with me.

1383
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:02,080
You didn't say 'yes'.

1384
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:04,048
I thought it over whole night.

1385
01:37:04,218 --> 01:37:08,382
I listened to that message,
again and again...

1386
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:13,854
I take Laurie and you to be them.

1387
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:18,291
I thought I wanna prove myself...

1388
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:19,957
that I can be a good dad

1389
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:22,001
and a good husband.

1390
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:31,610
Do you feel grateful to me
or really love me?

1391
01:37:32,546 --> 01:37:35,379
Do I take you to be her?
Or you take me to be him?

1392
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:39,614
If we got another one in our hearts...

1393
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,825
it means nothing even if we have sex.

1394
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:00,505
Hale.

1395
01:38:01,842 --> 01:38:03,969
You're a very good man.

1396
01:38:47,721 --> 01:38:52,385
Sorry, the number you just dialled
is not in service.

1397
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:58,359
Turn around, please.

1398
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:02,095
Take away your hands.

1399
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:04,664
Open your eyes.

1400
01:39:09,009 --> 01:39:10,499
Gorgeous!

1401
01:39:10,911 --> 01:39:12,037
You like it?

1402
01:39:14,114 --> 01:39:16,708
With this bouquet... Will you marry me?

1403
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:19,546
You're serious?

1404
01:39:19,653 --> 01:39:21,120
Yes.

1405
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:23,378
Let me ask you a question.

1406
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,082
If you can answer it, I'll marry you.

1407
01:39:25,192 --> 01:39:26,159
OK.

1408
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:28,922
What does our plate number mean?

1409
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:32,731
Forever.

1410
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:42,536
I do.

1411
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:04,330
Man, I gotta forget you.

1412
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:12,197
Dad.

1413
01:41:13,934 --> 01:41:15,060
Call him grandpa.

1414
01:41:15,169 --> 01:41:16,659
He's grandpa?

1415
01:41:16,770 --> 01:41:17,862
Yes.

1416
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:19,939
But I've got a grandad already.

1417
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,239
Call him. Good boy.

1418
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:23,934
He's so young.

1419
01:41:24,845 --> 01:41:26,779
He's honey mouthed.

1420
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,446
Isn't it tough?

1421
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:36,856
I work to kill time.

1422
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,554
My old buddy opened this shop.

1423
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:45,331
I'll have dinner at home tonight.

1424
01:41:45,866 --> 01:41:47,163
Good.

1425
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:50,028
I wanna move back home.

1426
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:52,232
Of course.

1427
01:41:52,473 --> 01:41:54,065
With him.

1428
01:42:01,348 --> 01:42:02,406
Are you a good boy?

1429
01:42:02,516 --> 01:42:04,211
Me? I'm not.

1430
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:06,513
Are you bad-tempered like your mom?

1431
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:08,952
Yes, I'm very bad-tempered.

1432
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:10,956
Will you bicker with me?

1433
01:42:11,058 --> 01:42:13,083
Yes, I'll.

1434
01:42:15,529 --> 01:42:17,292
Will you do anything rash?

1435
01:42:17,397 --> 01:42:19,922
And the more I tell you not to do,
the more you want?

1436
01:42:20,033 --> 01:42:21,091
Yes.

1437
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:23,635
But are you wicked?

1438
01:42:23,737 --> 01:42:26,137
And don't let me play anything?

1439
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:28,708
You may do whatever you want.

1440
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:32,074
But you have to tell me beforehand.

1441
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:34,773
Just tell me. OK?

1442
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,555
Dad.

1443
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:47,626
Put less salt into your soup.

1444
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,956
Too salty.

1445
01:42:49,062 --> 01:42:51,087
Too salty? Really?

1446
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:52,426
It's true. I never cheated you.

1447
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:54,626
Laurie, go to pee pee. Quick.

1448
01:43:46,954 --> 01:43:49,718
Hale, call me back, please.

1449
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,614
What? Sell or not?

1450
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:55,248
Think it over.

1451
01:44:55,922 --> 01:44:57,219
Wait...

1452
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:58,291
Let me make a call.

1453
01:44:58,392 --> 01:44:59,689
What?

1454
01:45:01,561 --> 01:45:02,255
Hello?

1455
01:45:02,362 --> 01:45:03,693
Hale?

1456
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:05,025
I just wanted to call you.

1457
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,760
What's the matter?

1458
01:45:07,868 --> 01:45:09,233
Tell me first.

1459
01:45:09,336 --> 01:45:10,997
You gotta tell me first.

1460
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:15,667
I wanna sell the car and do another job.

1461
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:18,267
Which one?

1462
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,073
Whatever.

1463
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:23,206
The sort of business...
once the client come in,

1464
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:24,511
they'll be very happy.

1465
01:45:24,618 --> 01:45:26,415
Sell ice-cream or something.

1466
01:45:27,688 --> 01:45:28,882
Have you thought over it?

1467
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,049
No, I haven't.
I can't waste my time thinking.

1468
01:45:32,859 --> 01:45:34,656
Do you wanna change your job?

1469
01:45:35,028 --> 01:45:36,689
Will you sell your car?

1470
01:45:37,698 --> 01:45:39,598
Where're you?

1471
01:45:39,733 --> 01:45:41,860
At a car company in Man Wui Street.

1472
01:45:42,035 --> 01:45:44,367
Man Wui Street? I'm there too.

1473
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:45,938
Really?

1474
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:47,697
Papa!

1475
01:45:57,017 --> 01:45:58,109
I just wanna tell you.

1476
01:45:58,218 --> 01:46:01,119
I sold my car and got the money.

1477
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:06,524
Wait, stay put...

1478
01:46:08,862 --> 01:46:10,762
You said last time...

1479
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:12,661
I'm a very good man. Right?

1480
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:14,700
If a girl says something
like that to a guy...

1481
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:16,496
She means...

1482
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:18,901
She won't go out with that guy.

1483
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:21,771
Then...

1484
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,706
Do you love me?

1485
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:28,607
I love... you... a little bit.

1486
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:31,076
A little bit...

1487
01:46:31,618 --> 01:46:33,142
That's good enough.

1488
01:46:33,253 --> 01:46:35,687
Is it because I have been helping you

1489
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:37,757
Or you found out that I'm divorced

1490
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:40,793
and lonely, so you feel pity for me?

1491
01:46:40,894 --> 01:46:42,589
Of course not.

1492
01:46:45,732 --> 01:46:47,757
Let's try it.

1493
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:57,634
I'll sell it!
