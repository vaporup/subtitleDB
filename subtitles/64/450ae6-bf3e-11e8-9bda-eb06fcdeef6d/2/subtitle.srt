1
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,350
Pals, I'm Siu Chiu
the maid of King of White Eagle

2
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:51,978
This is the grandson of White Eagle
Mr. Chang Mo-kei

3
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:52,953
You're Chang Mo-kei?

4
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:53,979
Yes, I am

5
00:00:54,523 --> 00:00:56,457
The order of King of White Eagle
who claims to be Chang Mo-kei

6
00:00:56,492 --> 00:00:58,619
whoever should be killed. Kill him

7
00:00:59,462 --> 00:00:59,757
Go

8
00:01:09,338 --> 00:01:09,804
Rush over there

9
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:38,430
I'm really Chang Mo-kei

10
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:39,428
Kill

11
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,069
Don't even know who's enemy
you deserve to be beaten

12
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:54,546
Great Solar Stance

13
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,671
Bravo

14
00:02:26,015 --> 00:02:28,142
Hero, which school do you come from?

15
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,485
Master, he's Chang Mo-kei

16
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,900
He's the son of Chang Tsui-san?

17
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:48,093
Why is he so powerful?

18
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:50,901
Where are you taking me to?

19
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,430
This is the forbidden zone of Ming Sect

20
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:53,066
What? Forbidden?

21
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:57,169
Shall we go in?

22
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,511
Other than the master of our Sect
can enter before his death

23
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:02,540
If he dies outside
the ones who carry his corpse

24
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:05,076
should commit suicide in here

25
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,244
How about you?

26
00:03:07,523 --> 00:03:09,548
I'm a maid, King of White Eagle
doesn't let mejoin the sect

27
00:03:10,793 --> 00:03:11,782
Don't go

28
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:13,586
Go

29
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,763
Damn it, if you move one more step
I want you to die terribly

30
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:21,498
lfl stay here, I would die terribly

31
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:22,697
You fool! Mister, let's go

32
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,236
Commander, what'II we do?

33
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,239
This is the grave of our exâ€”masters

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,770
There are many traps inside

35
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:34,509
If they go in, they'll surly be killed

36
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:36,516
Let's go back to help

37
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:57,539
What's the matter?

38
00:03:57,973 --> 00:03:58,962
I'm scared

39
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:00,538
Don't be afraid. Look

40
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,598
They're all skulls

41
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:04,944
I think they're the ones
who carried the corpse

42
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,509
Why don't we go out?

43
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,676
We're surrounded by the Flag Soldiers

44
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:09,809
So many men outside

45
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,650
I don't want to hurt
my grandfather's men with my kung-fu

46
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:15,689
I think, we have no choice
but to go forward

47
00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:18,726
I know there is a road
to get to the Bright Summit

48
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,195
You're only a maid of King of Eagle
why do you know that much?

49
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:31,101
I heard it, thus I know it

50
00:04:32,575 --> 00:04:34,133
My grandfather locked you
with such heavy chain

51
00:04:34,577 --> 00:04:35,805
There must be some reasons

52
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,643
Who are you? Don't cheat me

53
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:39,579
Don't you trust me?

54
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:41,177
I just want to know the truth

55
00:04:41,216 --> 00:04:43,343
Mister, l have made an oath
I can't tell anybody

56
00:04:43,586 --> 00:04:45,679
But I promise, I didn't mean
to hurt your grandfather

57
00:04:45,721 --> 00:04:46,585
and I'll never hurt you

58
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,648
Please let me keep some secret
will you?

59
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:52,920
I promise, when it's time, I'll tell you

60
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,687
OK. Let's talk later

61
00:05:02,805 --> 00:05:03,999
There're foot marks on the floor

62
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,175
Yeung Ting Tin, you're the master
of the Evil Sect, but so what?

63
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:17,717
Even you took away my lover, so what?

64
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,778
Can't imagine you would die here

65
00:05:22,758 --> 00:05:25,090
l, Shing Kwun, am now using the schools

66
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:26,788
to destroy your Evil Sect

67
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,230
I want to take your Magic Stance too

68
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:34,865
Then I'll be invincible

69
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:38,669
and to be the Pope of Yuen Dynasty

70
00:05:39,241 --> 00:05:40,708
Even I don't have the To Lung Sword

71
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,809
I can be the supreme
of the world of martial arts

72
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,614
The ex-master of Ming Sect
disappeared for over 20 years

73
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:48,614
In fact, he died right here

74
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:52,178
This may be Shing Kwun
the foe of my God-father

75
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,249
I see, he became
the dog of Yuen Government

76
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,214
He set a variance
between the schools and Ming Sect

77
00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:58,883
That's why he dragged
my God-father's family to death

78
00:05:59,161 --> 00:05:59,786
Who?

79
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:03,322
Chang Mo-kei

80
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:04,694
Didn't you die?

81
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:06,696
What's the enmity
between you and Ming Sect?

82
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,794
What's the enmity
between you and my dad?

83
00:06:08,837 --> 00:06:09,633
Why did you drag them like this?

84
00:06:10,305 --> 00:06:13,638
Yeung Ting Tin took my lover from me

85
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,742
I had adultery with his wife for 3 years

86
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,304
At last he discovered that

87
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,677
That's why he got mad

88
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:21,774
But he still wanted to kill me

89
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,650
My lover wanted to cover me
she committed suicide

90
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:29,088
I stayed 20 years
in the Shaolin as undercover

91
00:06:29,692 --> 00:06:32,422
I just wait for this chance
to destroy Ming Sect

92
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:35,192
You seduced his wife
and ruined his Evil Sect

93
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,754
and you claimed yourself reasonable

94
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,731
What a shame!

95
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,392
No matter it's right and wrong

96
00:06:41,804 --> 00:06:43,931
It's not your turn to criticize me

97
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:49,372
Chang Mo-kei, I'm sending you
to see your parents

98
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:51,808
Get lost

99
00:07:08,697 --> 00:07:09,823
What kind of kung-fu is it?

100
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:11,324
Great Solar Stance

101
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:14,965
I can't imagine
I'd be defeated by you

102
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:19,469
In fact, Chang Tsui-san had a secret

103
00:07:19,808 --> 00:07:20,706
What is it?

104
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,145
Shit

105
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:31,947
Get lost, I try to break it
with my Great Solar Stance

106
00:07:42,765 --> 00:07:43,322
Mister

107
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,223
Don't use Great Solar Stance

108
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:47,401
I'm afraid it would collapse

109
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,794
Are we waiting for death then?

110
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,472
We've to find other exit

111
00:08:12,094 --> 00:08:13,026
There're some words

112
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,492
Those who come into this cell

113
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,228
Should bow to the skeleton

114
00:08:19,268 --> 00:08:21,099
or the soul will give you trouble

115
00:08:21,804 --> 00:08:24,136
We're going to die
we'll be souls too

116
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:26,198
We don't need to be scared

117
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:28,765
Maybe we'll be saved

118
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:30,478
We should respect the dead
Come and bow

119
00:08:33,348 --> 00:08:35,339
Master Yeung
we're forced to disturb you

120
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,510
If we have a chance to get out

121
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:38,383
we'll take revenge for you
to kill Shing Kwun

122
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,480
Please bless us

123
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,859
What are these word?

124
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:57,201
It's the Persia language

125
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:58,171
Can you read it?

126
00:08:58,207 --> 00:08:58,935
Sure

127
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,839
After bowing to me

128
00:09:01,877 --> 00:09:03,936
You'll have my Magic Stance

129
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:06,447
After you learnt it
you can push the stone open

130
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,505
and reach Bright Summit

131
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,316
Mister
the Magic Stance is written on the rocks

132
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,948
He was really wise

133
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:19,391
he knew Shing Kwun wouldn't bow to him

134
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:22,126
So he designed such trap

135
00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:23,831
Practise now, then we may get out

136
00:09:24,366 --> 00:09:28,029
But it's not right
to steal Ming Sect's kung-fu

137
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:30,232
It's written that
after you've learnt it

138
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:32,467
You should pass a message
on behalf of Master Yeung

139
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:35,237
ask King of Gold Lion
to be his successor

140
00:09:35,277 --> 00:09:37,837
the Magic Stance
should be kept by him too

141
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,508
and get the Holy Fire Tablet
from Persia's Ming Sect

142
00:09:40,849 --> 00:09:42,817
He wanted your God father
to be his successor

143
00:09:42,851 --> 00:09:44,580
Since you're his God-son
it doesn't matter to learn his kung-fu

144
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,918
But, how long should it take?

145
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:50,389
It's written that

146
00:09:50,425 --> 00:09:51,949
for ordinary people, it takes 30 years

147
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:53,894
For those great kung-fu masters

148
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,954
ltjust takes 3 hours

149
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:58,859
l have the base of Great Solar Stance
ljust need 3 hours

150
00:09:58,901 --> 00:09:59,458
Go ahead then

151
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:06,538
King of Green Bat, you're hurt

152
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:09,671
Don't waste it...

153
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:12,873
Where are the women?...

154
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,473
Over there

155
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,481
Do you want me to eat your blood?

156
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:20,286
We're the red cross

157
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:21,311
We come to save

158
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:28,419
He's bleeding

159
00:10:30,065 --> 00:10:30,690
Beat him

160
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:34,896
You come to save, don't you?

161
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,560
We save those from strong sex desire

162
00:10:36,605 --> 00:10:37,594
and to save those
who reincarnated wrongly

163
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:38,962
How?

164
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,304
Kill you and let you reincarnate again

165
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:41,172
Kill him

166
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:47,077
You bastard, if I were not
hurt seriously I would kill you

167
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:10,231
Old bluffer
I've stopped the bleeding for you

168
00:11:12,374 --> 00:11:16,310
King of White Eagle
you're really something

169
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,609
We break even

170
00:11:18,747 --> 00:11:20,214
Dad, he's hurt

171
00:11:20,248 --> 00:11:21,442
Why don't you kill him?

172
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,975
He fought against five, instead, he won

173
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:25,651
If we take such chance

174
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:27,177
how can we claim ourselves heroes?

175
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,113
Stop

176
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:33,552
What's the matter?

177
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,120
You don't attack

178
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,152
We, Wah-shan School will attack now

179
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:37,495
Men, remove your rings and chains

180
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:38,931
Women, undress

181
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:40,093
Or, you'll be killed

182
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,604
I can't imagine I'd be bullied

183
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,740
by such jerks

184
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:51,007
Old bluffer, let's fight together

185
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:51,671
for our beloved sect

186
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,540
The Evil Sect is going to be terminated

187
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,575
Chi-yu, go with your sisters

188
00:11:57,753 --> 00:12:00,085
to kill all the people from Evil Sect

189
00:12:00,122 --> 00:12:03,091
and extinguish their holy fire

190
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:07,156
Yes, Master

191
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,293
King of White Eagle
you're a great kung-fu master

192
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:14,666
Your Eagle's Claws Stance
in the world of martial arts

193
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:17,035
is as great as
the Dragons Claws Stance of Shaolin

194
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:18,697
You'd better commit suicide

195
00:12:28,016 --> 00:12:29,506
Old Bluffer, don't be so impulsive

196
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,094
Listen

197
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:45,559
I, Chang Mo-kei request you
to stop for a while

198
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,435
Mo-kei, aren't you dead?

199
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,236
Is he the son of So-so?

200
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:51,261
That's your grandson?!

201
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,404
Thank you for your concern

202
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:55,042
Today, the fight between Ming Sect
and the schools

203
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:58,240
is all a trap set by Shing Kwun
the master of Tse Shun

204
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,678
Please keep calm
and not fall into his trap

205
00:13:00,115 --> 00:13:02,743
Bullshit, the Evil Sect
is so brutal

206
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:05,116
Wai Yat-siu needs blood for practicing

207
00:13:05,153 --> 00:13:07,280
Tse Shun killed many innocent people
they should be killed

208
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:08,848
Yes, I need blood for practicing

209
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:11,059
but I need chick's blood
pig's blood and my blood only

210
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,493
On that night
Mrs. Ho of Kwun-lun school

211
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:14,153
was killed by you

212
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:15,425
I didn't bite her

213
00:13:16,164 --> 00:13:17,096
About manslaughter?!

214
00:13:17,532 --> 00:13:19,591
Old nun, you killed more than me

215
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:21,065
You

216
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,070
Shing Kwun serves Yuen
he wants us to kill among ourselves

217
00:13:25,073 --> 00:13:25,801
Master, I hope you'll understand

218
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,402
As you said

219
00:13:27,742 --> 00:13:28,572
Where is Shing Kwun now?

220
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:30,738
He went undercover in Shaolin
for over 20 years

221
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,269
He's masked

222
00:13:37,652 --> 00:13:40,348
How dare you frame my Uncle Yuen Chun?

223
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:42,281
Where's Yuen Chun?

224
00:13:42,557 --> 00:13:44,081
He sneaked into the graveyard

225
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:45,616
and wanted to steal the Magic Stance

226
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,252
Master Yeung was dragged to death by him

227
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,561
Siu Chiu, make it clear

228
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:52,766
Grandfather
I won't let anybody hurt you

229
00:13:53,101 --> 00:13:55,535
Kid, you insulted Shaolin
what a big mouth you're having

230
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,561
Try my Dragon's Claws Stance

231
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:03,275
Master, would you let us go
if I can defeat you?

232
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:07,648
Deal

233
00:14:10,452 --> 00:14:11,817
So go ahead

234
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:41,574
The Dragon's Claws Stance of Shaolin

235
00:14:41,616 --> 00:14:45,245
is powerful than our kung-fu

236
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,885
This guy is really powerful

237
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:29,488
If I have 6,000 points

238
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,924
He has at least 10,000 points

239
00:15:47,449 --> 00:15:48,245
Dragon's Claws Stance

240
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:01,553
OK. Terminate my kung-fu now

241
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,389
I just come to stop your fight

242
00:16:04,432 --> 00:16:05,330
Not to create any more troubles

243
00:16:05,934 --> 00:16:07,765
By the way
I used the kung-fu of Shaolin

244
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,598
It's not an insult at all

245
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,403
Please forgive me

246
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:14,602
OK. Let's go

247
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:26,979
Chang Mo-kei, let me challenge you

248
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:29,551
They pushed my dad to death

249
00:16:30,292 --> 00:16:32,317
Now, they come
to slaughter without reasons

250
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:33,926
I have to take revenge for dad

251
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,358
No way, if I duel with them

252
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:41,699
it's being trapped by Shing Kwun

253
00:16:42,304 --> 00:16:43,236
Want to hold my temper

254
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:45,501
to be supreme
I can fight against the Government

255
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,672
Watch out
you should take care of her sword

256
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,405
Right, don't fight with her

257
00:16:51,413 --> 00:16:52,641
Master, please go ahead

258
00:16:57,485 --> 00:16:58,611
Magic Stance

259
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:05,482
Damn you nun

260
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:07,518
Siu Chiu

261
00:17:07,562 --> 00:17:08,085
Yes

262
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:15,960
Thank you, mister

263
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:22,335
Brother Mo-kei
in fact I was forced to trap you

264
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,568
Please forgive me

265
00:17:24,012 --> 00:17:25,309
I've never minded that

266
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,410
Please bring this sword to your master

267
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,712
Anybody wants to challenge me again?

268
00:17:35,357 --> 00:17:35,721
Chi-yu

269
00:17:40,528 --> 00:17:41,017
Brother

270
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,428
Mister

271
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:57,335
Mister, don't die...

272
00:17:57,445 --> 00:17:57,968
Mo-kei

273
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:01,674
Let's attack them together

274
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:02,842
I'm sure we can kill him

275
00:18:03,685 --> 00:18:04,879
His girl is so pretty

276
00:18:06,388 --> 00:18:07,116
Rape her

277
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:10,858
Who dares to take their advantage

278
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,551
Who is going to be Wu-tong's enemy

279
00:18:13,495 --> 00:18:14,427
Just a misunderstanding

280
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,387
Let's call for hookers

281
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:17,989
Don't rape

282
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:20,967
You're the bastard, let's go

283
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:29,570
Mister, you can't die. Don't leave me

284
00:18:29,878 --> 00:18:32,438
I'm protected by Great Solar Stance
I won't die

285
00:18:32,514 --> 00:18:35,039
But I can't use my kung-fu in this week

286
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,043
Mo-kei, take a good rest

287
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,420
If you have time
come back to visit Master Chang

288
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:43,952
Since we protected you
we've gone against the other schools

289
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,653
We should leave as early as possible

290
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:48,059
or we'll be blamed
of being allied with Evil Sect

291
00:18:48,463 --> 00:18:50,590
So what? Who do you think you are?

292
00:18:50,698 --> 00:18:52,689
Maybe, we'll save your Wu-tong one day

293
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:53,496
What are you bull-shitting?

294
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:56,030
Ching-su Uncle

295
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:01,064
please bring the Yee Tin Sword
to Master Chang

296
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,135
don't let No-mercy get it anymore
Alright

297
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,979
Mister Mo-kei

298
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:06,912
Go

299
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:07,778
Take care

300
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:10,512
Mister

301
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:15,990
Yau Tin Tsing, Wai Yat-siu
and Elements Flags, greet Master Chang

302
00:19:16,658 --> 00:19:17,682
I'm not your master

303
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,418
It's a tradition that
whoever uses Magic Stance is our master

304
00:19:22,897 --> 00:19:24,694
Our Sect has been split
in all these years

305
00:19:25,066 --> 00:19:26,533
Two Fairies

306
00:19:26,568 --> 00:19:29,093
King of Gold Lion
and Queen of Purple Dragon

307
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:31,596
they left after fighting
for the leadership

308
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:33,231
You saved us today

309
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,834
Other than you
who is qualified to be the Master then?

310
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,443
But Master Yeung's will

311
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:39,538
was my God-father to be his successor

312
00:19:40,014 --> 00:19:42,539
Either you or your God-father
is the same

313
00:19:46,221 --> 00:19:47,415
You Highness

314
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:50,515
Wah-shan School
is coming back with a troop

315
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:51,525
they want an attack

316
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,754
Damn it, what a bastard

317
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:57,493
I'm Chu Yeun-chang

318
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,723
now it's an emergency that

319
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:02,736
please instruct us what to do

320
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:04,938
Since many of you are hurt

321
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:07,032
we'd better hide up in the graveyard

322
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:08,707
What do you think?

323
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:10,569
If you're willing to be our master

324
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:11,601
We will do whatever you instruct

325
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,042
Listen, my followers

326
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,677
Get to the graveyard and hide up first

327
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:22,486
After we've recovered
we'll take our revenge

328
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:28,190
Bravo, Holy Master...

329
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,619
Wonderful

330
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:58,588
It's really a blessing
to have you be our leader

331
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:01,720
Chu Yuen Chang, ljust take the post
temporarily for my God-father

332
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:03,628
May I be frank

333
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:07,666
although you kept on refusing
to be the Master

334
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,836
I could tell from your eyes

335
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:13,637
you're willing to be the Master

336
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,641
We have so many followers

337
00:21:15,677 --> 00:21:17,838
and we fight with the gov't continuously

338
00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:18,846
we have strong power

339
00:21:20,114 --> 00:21:23,515
Since you want to take revenge

340
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:28,250
after being the master
you'll have greater chance to take revenge

341
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:31,747
and you may turnover Yuen's Dynasty
and to be the King

342
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,590
It's not impossible

343
00:21:34,562 --> 00:21:35,256
Cut the crap

344
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:38,629
King of White Eagle is old
King of Green Bat is so care free

345
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:40,258
They can't assist you much

346
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,997
No matter what

347
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:46,564
Just instruct me, I'm willing to help

348
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:48,675
From your eyes

349
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,268
I can see you're ambitious

350
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:54,712
If I make you my right hand
you'll have better success

351
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:56,645
You're really wise

352
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:58,580
I do want to be the Master

353
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:02,318
But the wise people
is usually disgusting

354
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:04,715
I understand

355
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:05,724
Get out of here

356
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:21,171
Master, please let us go

357
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:24,406
Wah Shan is a decent school
but with you jerks

358
00:22:24,612 --> 00:22:26,637
Master, don't kill us

359
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:27,773
I'll tell you some secret

360
00:22:28,016 --> 00:22:28,983
Go ahead

361
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,612
We've got some information
the days before

362
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:33,348
Wu Tong's students were attacked
by some monks

363
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:34,685
They seem to be from Shaolin

364
00:22:34,956 --> 00:22:36,685
All the students from Wu-tong
were caught

365
00:22:36,991 --> 00:22:38,686
Don't be afraid
they'rejust being kidnapped

366
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:39,658
not being raped

367
00:22:42,697 --> 00:22:43,755
Master

368
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:45,663
we've discovered that
Mr. Yan of Wu-tong is hurt

369
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,724
He is ahead

370
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:48,664
Uncle Yan Master

371
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:49,999
Uncle Yan

372
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:51,904
Mo-kei

373
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:52,632
How are you?

374
00:22:52,674 --> 00:22:56,041
We met some Shaolin monks
on our way back to Wu-tong

375
00:22:56,144 --> 00:23:00,274
They poisoned us with Scent

376
00:23:00,715 --> 00:23:03,377
which is the most poisonous thing
in this world of martial arts

377
00:23:03,418 --> 00:23:06,182
those who smell or are it'll lose
his kung-fu and energy

378
00:23:06,454 --> 00:23:08,684
Only the special antidote can solve it

379
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:12,656
I held my breathe, so I could escape

380
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:17,162
My brothers were all arrested

381
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:22,230
But later, I met two monks
They were so powerful

382
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,728
l was seriously hurt
They broke all myjoints

383
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,206
They're so cruel

384
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,739
Let's go to Shaolin
and get my uncles back

385
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,306
All hired? Right

386
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:35,679
Yes, you may ask them Over there?

387
00:23:37,018 --> 00:23:40,647
Master, all the doctors around are hired

388
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,088
and all the herbs are all bought
by one person

389
00:23:43,124 --> 00:23:44,022
It's strange

390
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:46,652
It may be done by the Shaolin monks

391
00:23:46,694 --> 00:23:50,687
No, he's living nearby
a place called Green Willow Villa

392
00:23:50,732 --> 00:23:51,790
Master

393
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,460
I think, they're sure that we need herbs

394
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,195
to cure Yan

395
00:23:54,235 --> 00:23:55,429
So they set this trap for us

396
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:57,126
Green Willow Villa?

397
00:24:05,913 --> 00:24:08,006
Welcome

398
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:10,111
My master is long waiting for you

399
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,512
May I know his name?

400
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:14,319
You'll know it later

401
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:22,757
Damn it, do you want to trap us?

402
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,355
Speak up, or I'll suck your blood

403
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:27,731
My men's blood is stink

404
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:28,836
If you want it

405
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,307
I've prepared some fresh blood for you

406
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,002
What's so mysterious

407
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,942
Why don't you tell us your name?

408
00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,740
I'm Chao Min

409
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,509
a nobody in the world of martial arts

410
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:41,412
It's meaningless to you

411
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,407
If you're scared, please leave

412
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:44,813
Watch out

413
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,359
Mister, she's the one
we met in the restaurant

414
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:56,497
Grandfather, King of Bat
she's the master of Jinxes

415
00:24:56,531 --> 00:24:58,396
There may be a severe fight later

416
00:25:00,868 --> 00:25:03,098
You're really something

417
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:04,836
Couldn't think you're so powerful

418
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,905
when I saw you last time

419
00:25:08,209 --> 00:25:10,268
I can't imagine
you could defeat the schools

420
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:12,978
and be the master of the Ming Sect

421
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:15,908
What a young hero

422
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,785
May I know why did you buy all the herbs

423
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,549
and hire all the doctors?

424
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:24,051
I've heard that
Mr. Yan is hurt by Shaolin

425
00:25:24,392 --> 00:25:26,019
I'm afraid he'd be mistreated
by poor doctors

426
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,085
so, I caught all the poor doctors here

427
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:32,357
But instead

428
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,961
I've prepared
the Black Jade Paste for him

429
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:37,231
Mister

430
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,908
We're not friends, why do you help us?

431
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,867
Making friends with heroes

432
00:25:44,912 --> 00:25:46,937
is always the practice
of our Yuen Government

433
00:25:47,281 --> 00:25:49,943
You're the No.1 kung-fu master
in the world

434
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:52,513
this doesn't mean anything

435
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:55,246
The Black Jade Paste is
the most wonderful medicine in the world

436
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,454
How can she give us that easily?

437
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,419
You're Manchurian

438
00:26:00,862 --> 00:26:02,386
My dad is Emperor Yu Yang

439
00:26:02,864 --> 00:26:06,163
Shaolin is so foolish to challenge you

440
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,825
We'll help you to terminate them

441
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:11,464
Master, is it Yee Tin Sword?

442
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:14,531
Right

443
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,907
We'll settle our own matters

444
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:19,508
We don't want the interference
from the government

445
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:21,312
Thank you very much

446
00:26:23,017 --> 00:26:25,042
Master Chang, please stay

447
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,612
I've prepared some food for you

448
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:31,922
I'll get changed first, may I be excused

449
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,654
We're leaving

450
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:37,293
Are you sure there is Black Jade Paste?

451
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:42,492
Damn it, how cocky she is!

452
00:26:44,872 --> 00:26:45,964
Isn't it true or not?

453
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:48,471
It smells nice

454
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:49,203
It's nice

455
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:52,973
This may be a trap, we'd better go

456
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:01,948
You...

457
00:27:02,056 --> 00:27:06,015
Master, we're so tired
We lost our energy

458
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,893
They're poisoned

459
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:11,024
My brothers were all poisoned by this

460
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,191
I'm the only one who held the breath

461
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:14,594
What we can do?

462
00:27:14,969 --> 00:27:16,334
I'll get the antidote from her

463
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,928
Siu Chiu, take care of here

464
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:44,030
You do keep your promise

465
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:47,162
You come to drink with me

466
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:51,437
Why do you trap us?

467
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:56,043
Master Chang, no one asked you
to touch the wooden sword

468
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,444
It's because one of you is greedy

469
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:01,141
That's why they're poisoned

470
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:02,411
Bring me the antidote

471
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:05,383
Master Chang, are you begging me?

472
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:06,477
Or forcing me?

473
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,148
Where are the Jinxes?

474
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:10,953
Ask them out

475
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,059
Are you scared of them?

476
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:15,028
I won't tell where they are

477
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,489
So you'll be scared

478
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:20,497
Don't think that I won't beat you
because you're woman

479
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:24,470
I know, so, I decided to...

480
00:28:24,505 --> 00:28:25,267
attack first

481
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:36,148
Yuen is such powerful that

482
00:28:36,183 --> 00:28:38,344
it has the greatest territory

483
00:28:38,686 --> 00:28:40,620
You'rejust a man

484
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:41,621
How can you beat our government?

485
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,563
The totalitarianism of Yuen
is hated by the people

486
00:28:54,602 --> 00:28:56,001
I just work for the will of people

487
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,229
We have voluntary armies
to fight against Yuen

488
00:28:58,439 --> 00:28:59,804
It's the will of the people

489
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,275
Can you beat the will of the people?

490
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:29,636
Master Chang

491
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,604
why not play a song with me?

492
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:47,549
Stop playing

493
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:48,519
I love it

494
00:30:01,268 --> 00:30:04,066
Master Chang, do you want to see my leg?

495
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:05,603
Just tell me

496
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:07,072
Why do you take my shoe?

497
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,166
You're so cunning
how can you claim yourself heroic?

498
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,439
I'm not hero

499
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,242
I'm a cunning woman

500
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,681
Have you heard that? Woman is cunning!

501
00:30:17,184 --> 00:30:18,082
I won't argue with you

502
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:19,477
If you don't give me antidote

503
00:30:19,787 --> 00:30:21,118
I'll burn your Green Willow Villa

504
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:24,515
I won't give in a damn

505
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:29,758
but your fellows are seriously poisoned

506
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:32,122
If they can't get the antidote
within 2 hours

507
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,327
they can never regain their kung-fu

508
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:37,798
Time is running short

509
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:39,296
Jinx's Palm

510
00:30:50,217 --> 00:30:51,582
This isn't Jinx's Palm

511
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:53,519
Yes, I don't know it

512
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:55,215
I just want to scare you

513
00:30:57,591 --> 00:30:59,388
If I didn't take back half energy

514
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,760
you'd have been killed

515
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:04,188
You don't wish to kill me

516
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,562
You like me

517
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,429
Bullshit

518
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:13,132
You love your maid more?

519
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:14,141
or love me more?

520
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,164
If you still don't give me the antidote

521
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:15,766
I'll kill yOu

522
00:31:16,477 --> 00:31:17,239
Go ahead

523
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,872
Answer me, or I won't give you antidote

524
00:31:21,248 --> 00:31:21,680
You

525
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,318
I know you love that maid most

526
00:31:25,352 --> 00:31:29,220
But I have made No-mercy go there

527
00:31:29,857 --> 00:31:30,516
How cunning are you!

528
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:35,219
Go, if you go like this
your fellows' kung-fu

529
00:31:35,262 --> 00:31:36,627
can never be regained

530
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:38,922
I have no choice

531
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:52,536
Give me or not?

532
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,274
No

533
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:54,646
Once more, are you giving me?

534
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:55,880
No matter how, I won't give it to you

535
00:32:03,357 --> 00:32:04,187
Aren't you scared of me?

536
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:05,786
I'll be your woman sooner or later

537
00:32:06,327 --> 00:32:07,521
I don't need to resist

538
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:10,396
Anyway, no one will help me

539
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:12,196
You can do whatever you want

540
00:32:13,234 --> 00:32:14,326
Shameless

541
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:20,197
Chang Mo-kei, I can give you antidote

542
00:32:20,241 --> 00:32:23,404
and the Black Jade Paste

543
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:25,210
But

544
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:27,405
you've to promise me three things

545
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:38,358
Master
where are those people of Ming Sect?

546
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:39,859
They seem to be disappeared

547
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,453
Master, look

548
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,961
No-mercy again

549
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:50,561
Siu Chiu, leave us alone

550
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:52,333
No, Mister asked me to stay here

551
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,035
No matter how, I have to delay

552
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:57,372
You bastards
what evil deeds are you planning?

553
00:32:58,646 --> 00:33:00,546
Master, they seem to be poisoned

554
00:33:01,015 --> 00:33:02,710
Damn you, if you dare to come over

555
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,377
I'll drink all your blood

556
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:09,483
What are you looking?

557
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,749
I have too much blood
it's alright to spit some out

558
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,293
I have let you go once

559
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:17,057
Now, I have a chance

560
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:18,598
to kill the evils
for the world of martial arts

561
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,333
Master
it's not heroic to take such advantage

562
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:22,897
Bitch, get lost

563
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,668
Bitch, if you can resist stances from me

564
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:27,071
I'll let you kill

565
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:29,774
How dare you

566
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:31,767
Or, I'll take three stances from you

567
00:33:31,912 --> 00:33:33,277
I'll let you do whatever you want
if you defeat me

568
00:33:33,314 --> 00:33:34,338
What a sharp tongue

569
00:33:34,948 --> 00:33:35,972
If you can resist three of my stances

570
00:33:36,417 --> 00:33:37,543
I'll let you go

571
00:33:37,818 --> 00:33:38,409
Come on

572
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:42,650
Siu Chiu...

573
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,554
How are you?...

574
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,352
Are you alright?

575
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,086
I can stand it

576
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:53,288
Two more

577
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:55,862
Master, she's seriously injured

578
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,370
Why not let me kill her?

579
00:33:58,305 --> 00:33:59,795
I should not take my words back

580
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:02,471
I dare not

581
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:26,726
Siu Chiu, leave us alone

582
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,532
One more

583
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:33,736
You're looking for death
I can't help you

584
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:50,889
Siu Chiu

585
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:52,353
Mister

586
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:54,516
Go

587
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,023
King of Bat, take the antidote to them

588
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:02,961
Mo-kei why did Chao Min
give you antidote?

589
00:35:03,404 --> 00:35:04,063
Be careful of tricks

590
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,401
I wanted her to take 3 in front of me

591
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:06,097
It should be real

592
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:11,374
Siu Chiu

593
00:35:13,013 --> 00:35:13,707
Mister

594
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,008
What a couple

595
00:35:17,584 --> 00:35:18,949
Bitch, how dare you come?

596
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,545
Why not?

597
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:22,680
Your Master promised
to do 3 things for me

598
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:23,781
That's why I give him the antidote
to save your lives

599
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,421
Mister

600
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,421
I just promised to do 3 things
which aren't against conscience

601
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:29,429
Not against heroism

602
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:32,890
I won't let you marry such pretty girl
Siu Chiu

603
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:37,100
Isn't it against conscience?

604
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,406
Master Chang, not that easy

605
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:42,636
When I have something in mind
I'll look for you

606
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:48,443
I've never met such cunning woman!

607
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:52,543
This woman must be a great foe
of our Ming Sect

608
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:55,584
There must be some stories
behind the raid against Wu-tong by Shaolin

609
00:35:56,123 --> 00:35:57,454
We have to go to Shaolin Temple now

610
00:35:57,825 --> 00:35:58,484
to get the truth

611
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,465
Master, are you alright?

612
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:19,202
Master No-mercy
Emperor Yu-yang wants you to be his guest

613
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:20,672
After you

614
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:28,748
Why is it so quiet?

615
00:36:30,457 --> 00:36:33,551
Master Chang Mo-kei
together with King of White Eagle

616
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,062
and King of Green Bat
want to meet your master

617
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,664
Our Master has his order
he doesn't want to see anyone

618
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,098
We come a long way to here

619
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:49,699
We want to see him now. It's urgent

620
00:36:50,777 --> 00:36:51,641
Please tell your master

621
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:53,945
He doesn't want to see you

622
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,505
Go back

623
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,643
Wait, from your movement

624
00:36:58,685 --> 00:36:59,947
it doesn't seem
to be the kung-fu of Shaolin

625
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:02,648
You have your head newly shaved

626
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:06,058
You aren't a real monk

627
00:37:08,028 --> 00:37:08,926
I said he's fake

628
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:11,964
Master, let's go in and check it out

629
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:12,658
OK

630
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:22,906
Mister, look

631
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:25,639
Kill Shaolin first, then Wu-tong

632
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:27,771
We, Ming Sect is the supreme
of the world of martial arts

633
00:37:28,148 --> 00:37:29,809
It's a trap

634
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:32,013
Are all the kung-fu masters
of Shaolin killed?

635
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:35,219
They may be poisoned by Scent

636
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:39,088
I think most of them may be nabbed

637
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:39,783
Shit

638
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:40,724
What is the matter?

639
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:41,926
Kill Shaolin then Wu-tong

640
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:43,893
They must have gone to Wu-tong

641
00:37:44,298 --> 00:37:45,230
Let's hurry there

642
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,200
Do you want to leave? Not that easy

643
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:52,601
Master, you'd better leave first

644
00:37:57,844 --> 00:37:58,674
Master, what's the matter?

645
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:00,574
Hung Shang from Shaolin
wants to meet Master Chang

646
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:01,573
Follow me

647
00:38:07,554 --> 00:38:09,886
Master
Shaolin has had the greatest disaster

648
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:11,891
We were raided by the Evil Sect
Other than me

649
00:38:11,925 --> 00:38:12,823
no one is alive

650
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,754
Really?

651
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,253
The kung-fu Masters who launched a raid
to the Bright Summit

652
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:16,091
were all arrested by the Evil Sect

653
00:38:16,597 --> 00:38:17,291
Master Chang, if you don't do something

654
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:18,889
the whole world of martial arts
will be under the control of Evil Sect

655
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:19,721
Get up first

656
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,233
Watch out, Master

657
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:32,739
The monk is fake
He's from the Evil Sect

658
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,608
Where is your dad and your uncles?

659
00:38:34,648 --> 00:38:35,307
Master

660
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,676
Mo-kei didn't die
Hejoined the Evil Sect

661
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,812
and learnt lots of Evil Magic

662
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:43,618
My dad and 4 uncles were not prepared

663
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:45,715
they're assassinated by him

664
00:38:45,759 --> 00:38:48,159
Five of them... Master!

665
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:50,858
Ching su, what happened?

666
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,929
Master

667
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,731
Ching su, how dare you assassinate me?

668
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:08,238
Even a scapegoat couldn't cheat you

669
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,875
Master
you should be the man of the world

670
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,054
You're a great in kung-fu
It's not wise to be a Taoist here

671
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:18,818
Why not follow me
to work for the government

672
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:21,587
to enjoy prosperous life together

673
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:22,185
You?!

674
00:39:41,682 --> 00:39:44,276
Chang San Fung, do you remember us?

675
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:47,182
I see, the troubles in all these years

676
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,847
were designed by the government

677
00:39:48,922 --> 00:39:50,753
Right, you're right

678
00:39:51,091 --> 00:39:55,152
Our Majesty wants to make you
the Pope of our government

679
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:56,991
If you're willing to work for us

680
00:39:57,197 --> 00:39:59,427
your school
will enjoy prosperity together

681
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,258
and your students will be the generals

682
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,996
to settle the riots for my government

683
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,238
I, Chang San Fung, dare do everything

684
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,401
but not to be a tribal betrayer

685
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:12,710
Chang, you don't work for us

686
00:40:12,746 --> 00:40:13,906
all you have to do is to only go to hell

687
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,809
Don't panic
I just want to scratch my back

688
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:38,969
Chang, how much blood do you have?

689
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,171
Protect Master

690
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:50,839
Don't. Let me handle it

691
00:40:57,057 --> 00:40:58,183
Magic Stance

692
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:07,165
Master

693
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:09,128
Master, are you alright?

694
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,464
Mo-kei

695
00:41:10,504 --> 00:41:11,198
How are you?

696
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:13,865
Ching-su, that bastard assassinated me

697
00:41:52,145 --> 00:41:54,841
Why are you so powerful?

698
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:57,241
You asked me to keep my virtue

699
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,008
I haven't used that

700
00:41:58,852 --> 00:41:59,784
Every morning

701
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,779
it's erected

702
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,825
No woman likes me
That's why I'm still a virgin

703
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,287
You have chance, use it

704
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,394
Cut the crap

705
00:42:29,316 --> 00:42:30,146
Your Highness

706
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:37,981
How can you be that impolite
to Master Chang?

707
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,852
How are you, Master Chang? I'm Chao Min

708
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:44,919
Your Highness

709
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,828
Master Chang, don't be tough

710
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:51,961
Do you want your students to be killed?

711
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:54,131
Men should die once

712
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:56,875
but we should die meaningfully

713
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,936
Master, don't panic. I'm here

714
00:43:01,848 --> 00:43:04,316
Master Chang, do you remember?

715
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:06,581
You're promised
to do 3 things for me

716
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,212
Will you keep your promise?

717
00:43:08,255 --> 00:43:10,917
If only they aren't against conscience
and not heroic

718
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:11,946
I'll help

719
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:16,222
First
you can't use the Great Solar Stance

720
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,024
Just tie himself up, alright?

721
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,300
What a sharp tongue
I'll seal your mouth sooner or later

722
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:29,166
Second, don't use your Magic Stance

723
00:43:29,209 --> 00:43:32,042
Alright, I promise

724
00:43:32,879 --> 00:43:34,141
Mo-kei
what kind of kung-fu will you use?

725
00:43:34,481 --> 00:43:35,311
Whatever, Master

726
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:37,411
Teach me any kung-fu of Wu-tong?

727
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:38,849
Isn't it alright?

728
00:43:38,885 --> 00:43:39,442
It's alright

729
00:43:39,486 --> 00:43:40,145
Master, come on

730
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:07,879
Tai Chi, grows from nothing

731
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:09,609
Master, you start that so late

732
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,549
I couldn't stand. Quick

733
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,216
Mo-kei, now I teach you

734
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:18,315
my self-developed tactics
since 100-year-old

735
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:19,325
Tai-chi Fist

736
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:24,323
It's the origin of motion

737
00:44:24,731 --> 00:44:26,494
The origin of everything

738
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:28,023
Positive and negative is connected

739
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:29,626
Can't be separated

740
00:44:29,669 --> 00:44:31,102
Elements help each other

741
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,570
They are against each other

742
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:34,402
Keep calm

743
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:36,272
Mind your respiration

744
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:37,970
Concentrate your mind

745
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:39,706
Pay full attention

746
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:41,441
Turn soft to hard

747
00:44:41,481 --> 00:44:43,506
Use both soft and hard

748
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:45,245
In Tai-chi

749
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:47,253
There is soft and hard

750
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:49,084
Use both soft and hard

751
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:50,714
Generate the force as you wish

752
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:08,031
Mo-kei, you're protected
by the Great Solar Stance

753
00:45:08,074 --> 00:45:10,042
You can learn
all kinds of kung-fu quickly

754
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:14,370
Tai-chi, just remember it's meaning
not the stance

755
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:17,639
Forget all your stances

756
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:20,050
Thus you can make it

757
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:30,655
Can your remember?

758
00:45:31,998 --> 00:45:32,987
I've forgotten

759
00:45:33,033 --> 00:45:33,965
What is the name of these stances?

760
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,989
Forgot

761
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:35,729
What's the surname of your dad?

762
00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:36,360
Forgot

763
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:37,964
OK, just remember

764
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:39,995
to beat them with no mercy

765
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,266
Congratulations
you have such a good student

766
00:47:16,769 --> 00:47:18,236
You have a good grandson too

767
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,863
I'll let you go now

768
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:22,238
This should be the third thing

769
00:47:23,643 --> 00:47:27,135
Chang Mo-kei
I won't let you repay me that easily

770
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:30,140
The lives of the schools
are controlled by me

771
00:47:30,183 --> 00:47:31,309
If I don't go back within three days

772
00:47:31,784 --> 00:47:32,910
they'll all be killed

773
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:35,251
What do you want?

774
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:38,350
Today, you're lucky, let's go

775
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:39,859
Not that easy

776
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,683
Don't go

777
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,385
OK, I won't go

778
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:46,125
I'll stay here or more days

779
00:47:46,733 --> 00:47:48,462
You'd better prepare the funerals
for your friends

780
00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:49,632
You may go

781
00:47:49,669 --> 00:47:51,193
but Ching-su can't

782
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:53,305
Your Highness, don't leave me

783
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:58,508
Such heartless dog

784
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:01,275
It's useless for me to keep it

785
00:48:01,681 --> 00:48:02,705
Take it if you like

786
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:09,212
Master, I deserve to be killed
I'm useless

787
00:48:09,255 --> 00:48:12,224
Master, just let me go

788
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:13,748
How can you face your dad?

789
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:17,490
Mo-kei...

790
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,861
Since we grow up together

791
00:48:18,898 --> 00:48:20,160
Please beg Master to let me go, please

792
00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:21,633
Mo-kei

793
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:23,158
Uncle Sung has a son only

794
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:24,700
If I kill you

795
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:26,870
he'll have no descendant

796
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:29,235
Alright

797
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:35,246
Master, I've terminated all his kung-fu

798
00:48:35,281 --> 00:48:36,475
Please let him stay alive

799
00:48:37,517 --> 00:48:38,245
Alright

800
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,217
Master, thank you

801
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:41,413
Thank you...

802
00:48:44,991 --> 00:48:48,427
Chang Mo-kei
you still have to do one thing for me

803
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:49,428
Remember

804
00:48:49,462 --> 00:48:50,451
if you want to save the schools

805
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:51,485
come to the capital to look for me
