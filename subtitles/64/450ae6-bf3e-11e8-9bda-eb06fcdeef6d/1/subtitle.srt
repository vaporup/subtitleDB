1
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:57,300
There was a legend
that Kwok Ching and his wife Wong Yung

2
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,104
got the sword of Yeung Guo

3
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,340
They mixed it with fine gold
and made two swords

4
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,715
One is called To Lung
and the other named Yee-Tin

5
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,941
And they wrote what they learnt

6
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,680
together with Ngo Fai's many tactics

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,951
and the secret of the most powerful
Kung Fu Scroll the Lunar Secret

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,924
was hidden inside the swords

9
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,792
Whoever got it, whoever
could rule the world of martial arts

10
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:25,690
The supreme
of the world of martial arts...

11
00:01:45,755 --> 00:01:48,849
Thus, no matter evil or virtuous

12
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:51,417
in order to get these two weapons

13
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:54,259
numerous fights were caused...

14
00:01:55,298 --> 00:01:58,734
Two groups were thus formed

15
00:01:58,768 --> 00:02:02,363
One, was headed by Shaolin

16
00:02:02,405 --> 00:02:03,929
Shaolin

17
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:05,372
Wu-tong

18
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:06,841
Ngo-mai

19
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,173
Kun-lun

20
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:09,869
Hung-tung

21
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:11,871
Wah-shan

22
00:02:13,917 --> 00:02:17,683
And their opponent was the Fire Sect
which came from Persia

23
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,345
They called themselves the Ming Sect

24
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,119
But, they were named
the Evil Sect by others

25
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:25,958
They're so mysterious
and always went against Yuen Dynasty

26
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:27,758
Ming Sect always caused riots against it

27
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,822
Their headquarters were located
at the Bright Summit

28
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:34,163
Branch leaders, Purple, White, Gold
and Green were all powerful

29
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:36,897
They were: Queen of Purple Dragon

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,703
King of White Eagle

31
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,174
King of Gold Lion

32
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:42,006
and King of Green Bat

33
00:02:43,112 --> 00:02:44,773
Groups were strongly against each others

34
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,282
Their fellows couldn't make friends
with each other

35
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,807
Otherwise, they would be killed

36
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:53,985
Chang Tsui-san
the 5th student of Chang San Fung

37
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:57,186
was righteous and heroic
disregarded the unreasonable rules

38
00:02:57,226 --> 00:03:01,185
fell in love with Yan So So
daughter of King of White Eagle

39
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,792
and he be-friended with
King of Gold Lion, Tse Shun

40
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,935
King of Gold Lion's master Shing Kwun

41
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,414
in order to help Yuen's Government
to destroy Ming Dynasty

42
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,212
he killed Tse Shun's whole farmily

43
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,084
Tse Shun risked his life
to seize the To Lung's Sword

44
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,748
to take revenge for his family
he killed many innocent lives

45
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:36,487
Tsui Shan and So So didn't want others
to know Tse's whereabout

46
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:40,366
they went to a nobody-land
Ice and Fire Island

47
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:43,201
to live in seclusion

48
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:48,400
Although he got the sword, Tse Shun
couldn't get the secret of it

49
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,347
until the 100th birthday
of Chang San Fung

50
00:03:52,382 --> 00:03:56,876
Tsui Shan brought his wife
and his son Mo-kei to visit his master

51
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,124
Crab in sugar candy

52
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:09,995
I want it

53
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,056
Please give me one Alright

54
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:16,998
Mo-kei, enjoy it

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,904
Thank you, mom

56
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,804
Good boy

57
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,270
I asked you not to get off the cart

58
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:28,176
This is the foot of Wu Tong Mountain
I think it doesn't matter

59
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:29,343
It's hard to say

60
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:31,114
For To Lung Sword
they can do whatever in mind

61
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:34,215
Dad, why do they want
God-father's To Lung's Sword?

62
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:40,120
I have told you many times

63
00:04:40,163 --> 00:04:42,461
Don't mention your God-father's name
don't you forget?

64
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:43,854
I won't do it next time

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,494
Remember, no matter who asks
about your God-father

66
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,940
No matter how they push you
don't tell a word, remember?

67
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,309
Yes, dad said
we can't betray our friend

68
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:59,211
Or, it'll be non-righteous

69
00:05:00,183 --> 00:05:01,343
Good boy

70
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,818
I think Master will like you

71
00:05:03,853 --> 00:05:05,184
Is your Master kind?

72
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,049
He is the kindest one among the kindest

73
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:13,026
Chang Tsui San...

74
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,324
It hurts

75
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:16,194
It's The Cry from Jinx
it'll affect one's mind

76
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,199
Resist it with your inner power

77
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,326
Or, you'll be hypnotized and lose your mind

78
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:21,864
Who are you? Show up now

79
00:05:42,558 --> 00:05:43,422
Jinx's Palm?

80
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,293
Mo-kei

81
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:52,366
Mother

82
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,969
I think you're the notorious Jinxs

83
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,565
Chang, if you want your son back

84
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,202
tell us where the King of Gold Lion is

85
00:06:01,477 --> 00:06:02,466
Stop dreaming

86
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:05,879
If we hit your son with our Jinx's Palm

87
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:06,677
What do you think?

88
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:07,574
How dare you?

89
00:06:08,484 --> 00:06:10,076
The kid is innocent

90
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,144
Why do you ill-treat this kid?

91
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,456
If you let him go

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,981
Wu-tong and the Ming Sect
will appreciate so much

93
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:19,491
Are you threatening me
with Wu-tong and Ming Sect?

94
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,958
Even that old jerk Chang San Fung's here

95
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:23,897
I won't give it a chance

96
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:25,093
Won't you?

97
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:28,196
Master Master

98
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,133
I, Chang San Fung
beg you to let the boy go

99
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,602
I see, the famous Chang San Fung
isjust a fatty

100
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,442
I'm all eyed

101
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,107
Right, my name is being exaggerated

102
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,584
It's not a big deal

103
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:47,518
Fatty
if you're afraid of my Jinx's Palm

104
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:49,491
ask your student
to tell us where Tse Shun is

105
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:52,291
Right

106
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,660
Tsui Shan, told them then

107
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,429
Master, Tse Shun is my buddy

108
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:00,367
Right, how can I be non-righteous?

109
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:01,427
That's right

110
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,734
In this martial-world
how can you be non-righteous?

111
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:04,603
How can you face others then?

112
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,402
Please give us some faces then

113
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:10,477
Old bluffer
step aside if you're afraid of death

114
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,540
Or you'll die on your 100th birthday

115
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,251
It's useless to sigh

116
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:27,120
You assholes
I think today is my birthday

117
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:28,095
I shouldn't quarrel or get angry

118
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,995
But you two forced me to break my rule

119
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,397
I want to teach you a good lesson

120
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:32,725
Brother

121
00:07:34,503 --> 00:07:35,595
How dare you beat my boy?!

122
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,037
If you hit him once
I'll hit him 100 times

123
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:41,038
Hubby, your master is so hot tempered

124
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,642
He's always hot tempered

125
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,171
OK, let's release the hostages together

126
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,616
OK, I don't think
you'd pull off a shunt

127
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:54,682
One, two, three

128
00:07:58,494 --> 00:07:59,017
Mo-kei

129
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:04,699
Mo-kei

130
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:12,468
Watch out Go!

131
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:21,478
Jinx's Palm?

132
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:22,783
Mo-kei

133
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:25,248
Take Mo-kei to Shaolin, no...

134
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:26,084
Take him to Wu-tong

135
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,515
I'll get the antidote from the bastards

136
00:08:36,532 --> 00:08:39,592
No way, if we go on like this
Mo-kei will be killed

137
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:40,260
Cut

138
00:08:42,638 --> 00:08:43,195
Mo-kei

139
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:48,507
Brother, how is he?

140
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:51,179
Jinx's Palm is so powerful

141
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:54,705
I think, we have to wait
for Master's antidote

142
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,216
Mo-kei he...

143
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:01,348
Mom, I feel so painful

144
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,286
Don't panic, Mo-kei

145
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:07,185
Here are some candies

146
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,629
If you feel painful, eat one
It's sweet

147
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,498
So you'll forget the pain, got me?

148
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,601
Uncles

149
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,097
Shaolin, Ngo-mai, Hung-tung, Wah Shan
and Kun-lun's representatives' approaching

150
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,109
they claim
to celebrate Master's birthday

151
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,373
In fact, they want Uncle Chang to tell
where the King of Gold Lion

152
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:37,087
Today is the birthday of my master

153
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:38,525
He asked us
not to make any grand celebration

154
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,495
So, he may enjoy a peaceful birthday

155
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:45,125
Thus, we appreciate your visit
and we'll express our thanks later

156
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,293
Please go back

157
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,669
We dare not disturb Master Chang

158
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,769
But he has to hand out
Chang Tsui San and Yan So So

159
00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:59,303
and tell us the whereabouts
of the King of Gold Lion

160
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,247
Then we will leave at once

161
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:05,480
Master No-mercy
what do you think it is?

162
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,379
How dare you get anyone you wish?

163
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,757
To take revenge for the victims killed
by Evil Sect

164
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,818
We want to get Tse Shun by any means

165
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,928
If you do not hand us the wanted

166
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:21,266
I'll fight with you then

167
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,130
I've heard that you're great in kung-fu

168
00:10:24,173 --> 00:10:25,231
I, Sung Yuen Kiu
would like to offend you now

169
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,678
Chang Tsui San, if you won't come out

170
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,817
your seniors will be killed

171
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,419
Stop

172
00:10:46,262 --> 00:10:48,423
Master No-mercy, don't go too far

173
00:10:48,964 --> 00:10:50,522
You're willing
to show up with your bitch!

174
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:52,560
Where is King of Gold-Lion?

175
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:54,933
I won't tell you my buddy's whereabouts

176
00:10:55,004 --> 00:10:55,902
You deserve it!

177
00:10:57,206 --> 00:11:00,903
You, be friend with that murderer

178
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,441
I'll wake you up

179
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,335
Bitch...

180
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:32,231
You?!

181
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,438
Damn nun...

182
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,278
You

183
00:11:42,318 --> 00:11:44,218
Watch my powerful Yee-tin Sword!

184
00:11:44,253 --> 00:11:45,447
It's no big deal

185
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:51,652
If not were your master Kwok Shang
my best friend

186
00:11:51,694 --> 00:11:53,025
I wouldn't have given you face

187
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:55,828
Yee-tin Sword is with you
that'll only bring bad luck to the world

188
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,457
I'll keep this sword
for your master for 7 years

189
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,834
7 years later
ask a better student to collect it

190
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,663
Chang San Fung
how dare you protect your sinful student?

191
00:12:07,743 --> 00:12:09,301
If we attack you together

192
00:12:09,345 --> 00:12:12,473
I don't think you can kill all of us

193
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,419
When you're exhausted
you'll be in deep shit too

194
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:18,920
How dare you? Are you threatening me?

195
00:12:18,954 --> 00:12:21,252
Master, I'll be wholly responsible
for this case

196
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,279
They come for me only

197
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,552
Let me settle it myself

198
00:12:23,893 --> 00:12:27,056
OK. You may settle it yourself

199
00:12:27,096 --> 00:12:28,290
but about fighting

200
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,389
I've never given a damn

201
00:12:30,432 --> 00:12:31,831
Are you threatening me?

202
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:36,502
Seniors

203
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:41,433
you want me
to tell brother's whereabouts

204
00:12:41,777 --> 00:12:46,476
In fact, you want his To Lung Sword
and to be the supreme only

205
00:12:47,316 --> 00:12:50,774
I'll never betray my friend

206
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,656
But I don't hope my master

207
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,818
at his old age to risk his life with you

208
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,461
Well, I'll give you an answer now

209
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:35,588
Tsui San!

210
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,159
Dad!

211
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,597
Dad!

212
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:41,503
Dad!

213
00:13:44,707 --> 00:13:46,971
Why do you kill yourself?

214
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,541
Mom, why did dad do so?

215
00:13:55,384 --> 00:14:00,014
Mo-kei, recognize each face

216
00:14:00,956 --> 00:14:02,389
remember them one by one

217
00:14:03,525 --> 00:14:04,787
You've to remember all their faces

218
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:09,924
for each of them is stained
with your dad's blood

219
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:11,626
Did they push dad to death?

220
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:16,000
You have to take revenge for your dad

221
00:14:17,806 --> 00:14:19,501
Don't let them escape

222
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:24,708
Miss Yan, we feel sorry
for the death of your husband

223
00:14:25,514 --> 00:14:29,712
Now, you're the only one
who knows where Tsu Shun is

224
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:36,515
Master Hung Man, come here
I'll tell you

225
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:38,992
But will you let my son and I go?

226
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:42,124
Monks don't take his words back

227
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:45,190
OK. I'll tell you only

228
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,735
Miss, can you make it clear?

229
00:14:52,207 --> 00:14:55,608
Master
King of Gold Lion is living there

230
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:58,076
Wish you to get the Sword soon

231
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:02,245
Madam... Where is he?

232
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:03,747
She didn't tell me

233
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,485
No? You do want to get the sword alone

234
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,113
Mom!

235
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:15,588
Mo-kei, mom cheated them

236
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:17,796
See, how powerful
is mom's cheating skill?!

237
00:15:20,736 --> 00:15:23,864
Remember, don't ever trust any woman!

238
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,908
More beautiful the woman is
more capable is her to tell lies

239
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:30,545
Remember

240
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:47,824
Mom

241
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,731
We've to take revenge for brother

242
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:51,994
No, save Mo-kei first

243
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:44,209
Mo-kei...

244
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:48,089
Master

245
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:51,014
You have terrific inner power

246
00:16:51,326 --> 00:16:52,190
So what?

247
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,926
These years, I've never got a way
to cure you from feeling cold

248
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,590
If the Shaolin monk
hadn'tjumped from here

249
00:17:00,135 --> 00:17:02,933
he'd have cured you
with his Great Solar Stance

250
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:04,027
Great Solar Stance?

251
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:07,239
Great Solar Stance
is the mysterious kung-fu of Shaolin

252
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,937
It's as powerful
as the Great Lunar Stance

253
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,771
But the Scroll has been lost for years

254
00:17:12,714 --> 00:17:15,012
Accidentally, a cooking monk in Shaolin

255
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:18,643
discovered it inside sutra

256
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,148
After he learnt the kung-fu
he defeated over monks and escaped

257
00:17:23,592 --> 00:17:24,616
then he came to challenge me

258
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,102
Chang, you're really great

259
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,737
Great Solar Stance can make you famous
in this world of martial arts

260
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,714
But I think, you're not virgin
before practicing such kung-fu

261
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:48,375
Otherwise, I couldn't have defeated you

262
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,582
I can't imagine this kind of kung-fu
isn't invincible

263
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,183
Why should I try so hard
to practise it then?

264
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,296
Chang San Fung, see you

265
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,396
Nuts

266
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:13,032
If he wasn't dead
his kung-fu would have saved you

267
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,166
My dear boy, no matter how
you've to be virgin to practise kung-fu

268
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,199
So, your kung-fu would be more powerful

269
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,168
Don't think I'm a 100—year old granny

270
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:19,771
My dicky erects every morning

271
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,376
What's that?

272
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:25,375
Why isn't mine do the same?

273
00:18:25,888 --> 00:18:26,752
You're weak

274
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:30,054
Master

275
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,349
What's the matter, Ching-su?

276
00:18:32,127 --> 00:18:33,059
7 years passed

277
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,092
Ngo-mai's Master No-mercy
sent her student Chow Chi-yu here

278
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,423
to get back their Yee Tin Sword

279
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:38,962
Chow Chi-yu?!

280
00:19:13,936 --> 00:19:19,374
How do you do, Master Chang?

281
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,142
Is No-mercy's temper better?

282
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,338
She's studied Buddhism in recent years

283
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,245
she's great improvement

284
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,751
You're a polite girl. It's lucky for her
to get such a good student

285
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,178
Mo-kei, return the Yee Tin Sword to her

286
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,030
Brother Mo-kei, are you the son
of Mr. Chang Tsui Shan?

287
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,396
Yes, Brother Mo-kei
is the orphan left by my uncle

288
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,837
I'm Sung Ching-su

289
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,439
My dad is the eldest brother
of Wu-tong's Seven Heroes

290
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,174
Thank you, Brother Mo-kei

291
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:59,447
Chi-yu, why not stay here for few days?

292
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:02,746
Let my student Yuen Kiu
teach you our sword stance

293
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,478
as present

294
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:04,953
Thank you Master Chang

295
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,075
Brother Mo-kei

296
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,215
Are you watching them?

297
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:41,447
Master Chang loves you so much

298
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,582
I think you'll be his successor for sure

299
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:51,063
Don't worry
Mo-kei can't practise kung-fu

300
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,327
We'll take care of him

301
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,828
Sister Chi-yu, why not practise together?

302
00:20:57,806 --> 00:20:59,797
He was hurt by Jinx's Palm 8 years ago

303
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,365
he can't practise Kung-fu in his life

304
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:08,039
Dad

305
00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:14,515
Ching-su, Master wants to practise
Tai-chi Sword for 3 months

306
00:21:14,556 --> 00:21:16,456
We have to stay with him
in the secret cell

307
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:22,429
In these 3 months, you've to take care
of everything in Wu-tong

308
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:23,462
Thank you, Dad

309
00:21:23,632 --> 00:21:25,793
Ching-su, you have to work hard

310
00:21:25,834 --> 00:21:29,133
In the 3rd generation of Wu-tong
Mo-kei can't practise kung-fu

311
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:31,834
You're the only one
that we have to depend on

312
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,567
Master Chang specially made
100 Heart Strengthening Pills

313
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,976
Give one to Mo-kei per night

314
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:40,345
so it can stop him from feeling cold

315
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,407
Ching-su will take good care
of Brother Mo-kei

316
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,332
What are you doing?

317
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:01,969
Go... Go

318
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:05,872
Brother Mo-kei, what's happened?

319
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,170
Someone peeped at you

320
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:11,469
Really?

321
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,914
They're so bad. I'm so scared

322
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,244
They've all gone

323
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,086
But I'm scared too

324
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,909
Why not come and accompany me?

325
00:22:27,162 --> 00:22:28,424
I know you wouldn't accompany me

326
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,034
Let me accompany you

327
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,273
I know you care me most

328
00:22:44,045 --> 00:22:46,605
Are you hot? No

329
00:22:46,648 --> 00:22:47,580
You're sweating

330
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:03,687
How dare you!

331
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:06,226
Chang Mo-kei
you think you're a lady killer?

332
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:23,984
Brother Ching-su
will there be any accident?

333
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,310
Don't worry, I'm in charge now

334
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:47,434
You jinx
you dragged your parents to death

335
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:49,574
You only know
how to flatter Master Chang

336
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,146
So he passes you his inner energy
to keep you from coldness

337
00:23:52,981 --> 00:23:54,448
If he'd passed me his inner energy

338
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:56,080
I'd have been top graded kung-fu master

339
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:57,685
Your mom isjinx

340
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,316
You can insult me, but not my mom

341
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,188
I wonder are you the blood of my uncle

342
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,056
Maybe you're a son of a bitch

343
00:24:12,234 --> 00:24:13,201
Go to hell

344
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:14,997
Brother Ching-su

345
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,996
Catch him, I wanna chop his hand off

346
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:25,010
I see, Wu-tong is not heroic at all

347
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,310
My friend, who are you?

348
00:24:27,782 --> 00:24:29,511
Friend? I'm not a friend of yours

349
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:31,017
Dress

350
00:24:32,654 --> 00:24:34,087
Bitch

351
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:35,554
Come down if you have guts

352
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:03,176
Wu-tong's kung-fu is nothing special

353
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:04,442
The kung-fu of Ming Sect
is much more powerful

354
00:25:05,053 --> 00:25:07,180
Sister Chi-yu
attack her with your Yee-tin Sword

355
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,154
You bitch

356
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,057
Yee Tin Sword is really in Wu-tong

357
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,150
Aren't you leaving?

358
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,657
Watch out
don't let the dogs of Wu-tong kill you

359
00:25:14,195 --> 00:25:15,321
I don't allow you insult Wu-tong

360
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,059
You must be insane

361
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,058
I'll chat with you after the fight

362
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:45,191
Bitch, I'll let you see
how powerful my sword is

363
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:53,096
Thank you, I come for this Sword in fact

364
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,364
I want to break
this non-breakable Cold-chain

365
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,637
Wu-tong's Sword Stance

366
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,105
Escape

367
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,475
Here... run

368
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,418
Your kung-fu is so bad

369
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,181
Forget about me, go now

370
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:20,656
No, they'd kill you if they catch you up

371
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,602
Kidding, you bring me to this dead end?

372
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,833
Chang, you allied with the Evil Sect
and mess our temple

373
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:36,138
Now, with the name
of Acting Manager of Wu-tong

374
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,166
I exile you

375
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,277
Wu-tong students have my order Yes

376
00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:42,215
Kill with no mercy Yes

377
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,239
Miss, I've cragged you down

378
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:44,247
Call me Siu Chiu

379
00:26:44,586 --> 00:26:46,486
How dare you seduce man
in such critical moment?

380
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,220
Where can you go?

381
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:11,339
It's soft?!

382
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,950
Why do you loosen your hands
without any notice?

383
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:25,558
For I touched yours...

384
00:27:28,496 --> 00:27:30,896
Dumb-bell, you must be educated
by your dad

385
00:27:31,266 --> 00:27:33,427
My dad died years ago

386
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:35,394
You're called Chang Mo-kei

387
00:27:36,638 --> 00:27:38,538
Is your dad Chang Tsui-san?

388
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,301
My Chang, I'm your maid Siu Chiu

389
00:27:43,611 --> 00:27:44,305
Get up first

390
00:27:44,345 --> 00:27:45,812
Siu Chiu
is the maid of King of White Eagle

391
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:48,441
I offended King of White Eagle
so he locked me up

392
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,780
I went into fugitive

393
00:27:49,818 --> 00:27:52,878
I've heard Yee Tin Sword is in Wu-tong
I wanted to make use of it

394
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,946
Luckily I met you and you saved my life

395
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:56,654
Get up first

396
00:27:57,292 --> 00:27:58,418
I'm not your Mister

397
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:00,324
You touched me again

398
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,195
You're the grandson
of King of White Eagle

399
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:05,358
so I have to greet you Mister

400
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,037
In fact, I haven't seen my grandfather
since birth

401
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:16,368
What kind of noise is it? Monster?

402
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:21,246
Go...

403
00:28:31,326 --> 00:28:31,849
This way

404
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:32,723
That way...

405
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:52,644
I can't imagine
there would be visitors for me

406
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:53,711
You are...

407
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,341
I'm the soul of hell

408
00:28:57,585 --> 00:28:59,610
Are you the student of Wu-tong?

409
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:01,316
I'm Chang Mo-kei

410
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:07,417
Chang San Fung made me suffer here

411
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:10,459
It's not too much to eat
one of his student, right?

412
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:13,366
Are you the cooking monk?

413
00:29:13,768 --> 00:29:15,759
You remember me?

414
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:21,341
The girl after you is so attractive

415
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,401
She must be more delicious than you

416
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,475
She isn't Wu-tong's student
Come and eat me

417
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:31,911
You're heroic too!

418
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:36,385
Mister...

419
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:39,087
Mister Chang, how are you?

420
00:29:40,094 --> 00:29:42,494
It's cold

421
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,567
What have you done to him?

422
00:29:47,468 --> 00:29:50,767
Kidding!
He's already been serious injured

423
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,775
Hey, who hurt you?

424
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,001
I was hit by the Jinx's Palm 8 years ago

425
00:30:01,482 --> 00:30:03,416
Nothing can cure it

426
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,844
It must be Master Chang passes you
inner energy in these years

427
00:30:09,023 --> 00:30:10,547
He loves you so much

428
00:30:10,992 --> 00:30:12,687
Senior, I know you can cure him

429
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,588
I beg you to cure him

430
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,997
My Great Solar Stance
is the only solution

431
00:30:17,632 --> 00:30:20,465
But why should I cure Chang's people?

432
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:25,665
Chang Mo-kei, unless you scold
your Master Chang as asshole

433
00:30:25,807 --> 00:30:28,401
Then I'll teach you Great Solar Stance

434
00:30:28,443 --> 00:30:29,432
to cure you from coldness

435
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:30,774
Impossible

436
00:30:35,717 --> 00:30:38,185
You don't save him. That's OK
Why did you hit him?

437
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:42,488
Just scold Chang as Shame-less asshole
for three times

438
00:30:43,157 --> 00:30:46,888
Then you'll be free
from this kind of suffer forever

439
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:50,622
and you'll have invincible power

440
00:30:51,966 --> 00:30:53,558
This is a piece of cake

441
00:30:54,869 --> 00:31:02,139
Follow me
Chang is a shameless asshole...

442
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:08,514
Shameless asshole...

443
00:31:09,417 --> 00:31:09,974
is you

444
00:31:10,418 --> 00:31:13,649
OK, I'll see
how can you get through this night

445
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,785
Mister...

446
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,021
It's cold Cold?!

447
00:31:25,566 --> 00:31:26,498
Mister how are you?

448
00:31:26,534 --> 00:31:27,967
It's cold Still very cold?

449
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,661
So cold...

450
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,444
Will it be warmer?

451
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:55,028
I can't imagine Chang
has such a brave student like him

452
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:33,198
I'm still living...

453
00:32:33,234 --> 00:32:34,929
Mister are you alright?

454
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:36,065
Siu Chiu

455
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:39,563
Mister
are you having any weapon with you?

456
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:40,732
No

457
00:32:41,576 --> 00:32:43,976
Why do I feel
something solid pointing at me?

458
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:44,773
Really?

459
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:50,575
Erected?

460
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,107
What is it?

461
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,645
Nothing

462
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,122
Shit, will that make her pregnant?

463
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:58,724
So soon?

464
00:32:59,093 --> 00:32:59,923
What did you say?

465
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,590
Nothing, I said I wake up soon

466
00:33:02,997 --> 00:33:06,660
Mister, you could stand last night
I think you'll be alright

467
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:07,930
Stop dreaming!

468
00:33:11,973 --> 00:33:13,770
You're lucky last night

469
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,235
You'll feel ice-cold 2 to 3 times a day

470
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:20,577
If no one uses inner energy
to keep your life

471
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:22,606
You'll die

472
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:23,709
You hard-hearted

473
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:28,244
Chang Mo-kei
if you don't learn my Great Solar Stance

474
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,553
You'll suffer coldness
for the rest of your life

475
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:35,622
Leave Wu-tong, and be my student

476
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:38,790
Master Chang is so nice to me
I can't do that

477
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,031
You're sick

478
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:42,828
Why do you push him
to learn your kung-fu?

479
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:48,668
10 years ago
I was defeated by Chang San Fung

480
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:51,102
I'm so furious

481
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,683
I want my student to be more superior
than any of his student

482
00:33:57,985 --> 00:33:58,952
Why not teach me?

483
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:01,579
If a woman practices Great Solar Stance

484
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,922
one year later, she'll have flat chest
with hairy hands and legs

485
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,225
with beard and man's voice

486
00:34:10,198 --> 00:34:11,392
Do you want it?

487
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,089
Forget it

488
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:16,636
Mister, his backbone is broken
he moves with that ball

489
00:34:16,904 --> 00:34:17,996
Why not promise him now

490
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:19,734
after learning his kung-fu
then we can take our words back

491
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,710
Wu-tong's student
is always righteous and virtuous!

492
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,145
I'm a Wu Tong's student
but he forces me to study his kung-fu

493
00:34:27,715 --> 00:34:28,647
there must be trick

494
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:29,579
I won't learn it anyhow

495
00:34:29,617 --> 00:34:31,312
I don't think you can force me
to get your kung-fu

496
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,751
Can't I?

497
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,717
Siu Chiu

498
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,040
Let me help you

499
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,206
I don't allow you to do so

500
00:35:08,723 --> 00:35:11,089
Great Sun appears
the blood flows backward

501
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:16,024
Don't press my head with the ass

502
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:18,462
Air from belly goes through
the whole body

503
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,198
It's breaking

504
00:35:24,238 --> 00:35:25,000
Blood sea

505
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:25,733
Top of the back

506
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:26,637
Solar Pool

507
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:27,402
Door of life

508
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:28,373
Ken-su k. ..

509
00:35:41,188 --> 00:35:44,749
Chang, you have the 1st grade

510
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:46,419
of the Great Solar Stance

511
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:50,723
You have my kung-fu now

512
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:52,727
You can never get rid of it

513
00:35:55,036 --> 00:35:57,766
I'll push you to learn the 2nd grade

514
00:35:57,805 --> 00:35:59,739
Unless you die

515
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:02,709
or you're betraying Wu-tong

516
00:36:08,316 --> 00:36:09,283
I'm useless

517
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:11,808
to let that evil bitch
hit Mo-kei down the cliff

518
00:36:11,852 --> 00:36:12,784
I was late

519
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:16,320
I could only killed the bitch
but couldn't save Mo-kei

520
00:36:17,825 --> 00:36:19,258
Please kill me

521
00:36:19,527 --> 00:36:21,461
as compensation to Uncle Chang

522
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:22,291
I'll kill you now

523
00:36:23,798 --> 00:36:25,823
Yuen Kiu, you can't save Mo-kei anyway

524
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,366
It's useless to kill him

525
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:29,829
Brother Ching-su tried his best

526
00:36:30,838 --> 00:36:32,032
Mo-kei is such a poor boy

527
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:34,805
Death may be a release to him

528
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:39,869
Shaolin invited us
to launch a raid to Bright Summit

529
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:42,444
We'd maintain peace and righteousness
of the world of martial arts

530
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,950
Yuen Kiu, lead yourjuniors, Ching-su
and Chi-yu to go with you

531
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,246
Yes, Master

532
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:03,029
The 9th grade Great Solar in the Sky

533
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,184
Chang, you've got all stances
from Great Solar Stance

534
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:26,790
From now on, you're full of mysterious
and powerful energy

535
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,556
Your wound is cured too

536
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:31,397
From now on, it's hard for you to die

537
00:37:33,134 --> 00:37:34,533
Master, you made it!

538
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:38,435
Thank you Master

539
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,468
Aren't you unwilling
to learn my kung-fu?

540
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,840
It should be a suffering instead

541
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:45,311
I know you didn't mean to teach me

542
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,504
You just want
to lose the face of my Master

543
00:37:48,049 --> 00:37:50,540
So, I just tricked you
to teach me your kung-fu

544
00:37:52,319 --> 00:37:55,550
I have to take revenge for my parents
I wished to learn it most

545
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,448
You're cunning

546
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,391
Not only pretty women
aren't trustworthy

547
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:03,028
You can't even trust
those seem to be kind-hearted!

548
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:04,825
I wanna kill you

549
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:07,366
I have the same kung-fu as you

550
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,857
How can you kill me?

551
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,841
Watch out, he's so powerful

552
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:47,670
Senior, please forgive me

553
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:51,537
You cured me by your kung-fu

554
00:38:51,946 --> 00:38:53,004
Thank you for your lesson

555
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:54,978
You cunning guy

556
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:56,906
If I can make my revenge

557
00:38:57,051 --> 00:38:58,678
I'll come back to save you

558
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,916
You'll die terribly

559
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,454
Let's wait and see
Let's see who'll die first

560
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:04,219
Let's go

561
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,894
See how long will you two get together!

562
00:39:08,629 --> 00:39:10,426
You'll not have happy ending!

563
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:28,605
I've made it

564
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:34,613
Shaolin, Ngo-mai, Hung-tung
Kwun-lun and Wah-shan

565
00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:37,057
All of you're stained
with the blood of my parents

566
00:39:46,667 --> 00:39:49,329
I want you to repay it

567
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,634
Your look is horrible

568
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,466
If you were me

569
00:39:57,945 --> 00:39:59,936
You kept every hatred
inside your heart for 8 years

570
00:40:00,714 --> 00:40:02,272
to be bullied and insulted all the time

571
00:40:03,617 --> 00:40:06,142
When you have a chance to release
you'll act like me

572
00:40:07,354 --> 00:40:08,651
Are you going back to Wu-tong?

573
00:40:09,957 --> 00:40:12,050
Sung Ching-su
is the only son of my uncle

574
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,956
I can't take revenge to him

575
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,424
No way

576
00:40:18,032 --> 00:40:18,999
I won't go back to Wu-tong

577
00:40:21,268 --> 00:40:22,565
With the help of my Great Solar Stance

578
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:25,001
I can go everywhere

579
00:40:25,406 --> 00:40:27,101
I'll go to Bright Summit
to see my grandfather

580
00:40:27,474 --> 00:40:29,066
And I'll beg him to unlock you

581
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:30,098
Thank you

582
00:40:30,611 --> 00:40:31,635
We risked our lives together

583
00:40:32,046 --> 00:40:33,172
don't call me Mister anymore

584
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,208
I love to serve you

585
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:36,741
Will you let me serve you forever?

586
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,383
You're so nice to me
I'll always remember it

587
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,213
Now you're so powerful
I think you'll attract many girls

588
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,651
I think, you'll soon forget me

589
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,991
No, once there is sun
I won't let you leave me

590
00:41:03,177 --> 00:41:04,007
Mister

591
00:41:08,349 --> 00:41:12,046
Crab in sugar candies...

592
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,748
See, there're candies for sale

593
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,217
These were the last thing
that my mom bought me

594
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,784
After I was hit by Jinx's Palm

595
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:23,156
she gave me 3 candies

596
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,156
She asked me to eat when I felt painful

597
00:41:26,333 --> 00:41:28,358
When they were dead
you ate the first one, right?

598
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:30,492
I dried these two

599
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,771
So, I've to keep it properly

600
00:41:35,142 --> 00:41:35,699
Take us some wine and food

601
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:37,034
Yes...

602
00:41:37,378 --> 00:41:39,539
Schools of martial arts are
launching a raid to the Bright Summit

603
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,208
I'm sure they'll destroy the Evil Sect

604
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:45,483
If we're late

605
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,077
we'll then miss the great moment

606
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,154
So what if you can catch them?

607
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:51,756
It means more people
will be sent to hell only

608
00:41:52,459 --> 00:41:57,123
There are branch leaders
and the invincible Elements Flat

609
00:41:57,631 --> 00:42:01,089
Don't you think a small potato
like you can destroy them?

610
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:02,332
How ignorant are you!

611
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,661
She must be somebody in the Evil Sect

612
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:04,295
Arrest her

613
00:42:15,883 --> 00:42:16,747
Let's hide up first

614
00:42:27,094 --> 00:42:29,119
You're putting a quart into a pint pot!

615
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,657
Is she somebody in the Ming Sect?

616
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:32,660
I've never seen her

617
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,598
Let's deal
about the raid to Bright Summit

618
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:37,900
I'll try my best

619
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,177
Do you know them?

620
00:42:46,613 --> 00:42:49,207
Of course, they hit me
with Jinx's Palm 8 years ago

621
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:51,379
Don't panic

622
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,912
Many powerful kung-fu masters are here
we can't compete with them

623
00:42:54,621 --> 00:42:55,588
Mr. Deer

624
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:56,589
How do you do?

625
00:42:56,623 --> 00:42:58,147
Master, we all depend on you

626
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:03,159
Please send my regards to his Majesty
See you

627
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,130
Who is hiding here?

628
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:07,758
Come out!

629
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:10,632
What are you doing here?

630
00:43:18,645 --> 00:43:20,545
Kid, what are you looking at?

631
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:22,710
He seems to be familiar to us

632
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,578
Forget it
a couple is enjoying chatting here

633
00:43:28,155 --> 00:43:28,951
Let's go

634
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:34,491
I just wanted...

635
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,393
Luckily you didn't move. See

636
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,646
This guy must be somebody

637
00:43:54,681 --> 00:43:57,172
Even Deer Man and Crane Man

638
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,206
seem to be his fellows

639
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,218
Guy? This is a woman

640
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:04,452
Woman? She's like my mom

641
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:08,192
She's pretty
so you said she's like your mom

642
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,321
You're like my mom now

643
00:44:10,364 --> 00:44:11,422
Still kidding?!

644
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,160
The Bright Summit is surrounded
by the schools

645
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,224
Let's hurry there OK

646
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:18,704
The Evil Sect is well prepared

647
00:44:19,606 --> 00:44:21,267
The Elements Flags are all in position

648
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:26,669
Even Wai Yat-Siu
King of Green Bat has come back to help

649
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:28,237
Even though he's against
King of White Eagle

650
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,783
If Queen of Purple Dragon
and King of Gold Lion are back

651
00:44:32,986 --> 00:44:34,954
It'll be difficult for us to fix them

652
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,350
If King of Gold Lion is back
that's perfect

653
00:44:38,625 --> 00:44:41,253
We can seize his To Lung Sword

654
00:44:41,328 --> 00:44:43,262
Do you want my Yee Tin Sword too?

655
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,297
That's what I want

656
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:46,290
I dare not

657
00:44:47,301 --> 00:44:49,997
She can read my mind

658
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,767
Luckily she didn't know
I wanted to rape her too

659
00:44:53,841 --> 00:44:55,331
You rape her

660
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:57,739
I'll take her students instead

661
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,279
What a hand job for you, pal

662
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,506
My pleasure

663
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:03,282
What are you two talking about?

664
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:06,485
Well, we decided to donate
the treasure of the Evil Sect to the poor

665
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,648
Queen of Purple Dragon is the Holy Lady
of Persia's Ming Sect

666
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,854
She's disappeared for many years

667
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:12,655
It's believed that she's gone to Persia

668
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:16,325
After a severe fight
King of Gold Lion were blind

669
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,590
It's not difficult to handle him

670
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:23,426
But King of White Eagle and
King of Green Bat are difficult to handle

671
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:25,895
Uncle, I have an idea

672
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,931
Go ahead

673
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:30,933
King of White Eagle has a grandson

674
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,680
He's the son of Chang Tsui-san

675
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:35,641
He's called Chang Mo-kei

676
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,511
He died few months ago

677
00:45:39,286 --> 00:45:41,345
King of White Eagle doesn't know it

678
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,722
And old man

679
00:45:44,591 --> 00:45:48,322
if he meets his grandson again
he'll be very happy

680
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:52,358
If his grandson attacks suddenly

681
00:45:53,534 --> 00:45:55,695
sure he'll have a great chance
to kill him

682
00:45:56,036 --> 00:45:56,730
Great idea

683
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,733
So we can kill King of White Eagle
and King of Green Bat easily

684
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,364
And rob all the money of them

685
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:01,630
Sell all the woman to be hookers

686
00:46:02,943 --> 00:46:05,571
We're from decent schools of martial arts
how can we do so?

687
00:46:05,879 --> 00:46:07,847
You're using my passed nephew

688
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,508
I don't agree to do so

689
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:10,508
Isn't it good?

690
00:46:10,551 --> 00:46:12,519
Wejust want to help the poor only

691
00:46:13,387 --> 00:46:16,083
I agree with Master Yuen Chun

692
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:19,455
You asked someone to act as Chang Mo-kei

693
00:46:19,826 --> 00:46:21,316
Who is the most suitable person then?

694
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,327
The son of Mr. Sung is the best choice

695
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:27,333
I won't allow our Wu-tong student
to do such thing

696
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:30,567
You cunning bastards
are discussing evil traps

697
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,399
Watch out for being hit by thunder

698
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:45,750
Bat's down

699
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:48,851
It's King of Green Bat, Wai Yat-siu

700
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,459
Wai, let my wife go

701
00:46:54,494 --> 00:46:57,861
Your wife is so fat, it's no big deal
for me to suck her blood

702
00:46:58,165 --> 00:46:59,393
Damn it

703
00:47:06,006 --> 00:47:07,496
No-mercy, you killed my wife

704
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:10,535
If anyone is bitten by Wai Yat-siu

705
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,511
one will lose one's mind
and obey Wai only

706
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:14,410
If I don't kill your wife
we'll have one more enemy

707
00:47:15,983 --> 00:47:17,416
You can't compete with her

708
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,588
Wai doesn't know how powerful
Yee Tin Sword is

709
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,082
he used Mrs. Ho to be his shield

710
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:25,957
I believe that he's hurt
by the energy of my sword

711
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:37,495
Your Highness

712
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:49,676
Have the schools arrived the hillside?

713
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,550
Your Highness, they have arrived

714
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,547
Set the elements position

715
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:59,525
When they come half way

716
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:01,457
I want half of them to die

717
00:48:01,495 --> 00:48:02,120
Yes

718
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,128
I'm back

719
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:08,865
Your Highness

720
00:48:09,603 --> 00:48:11,867
Bat, I'm glad you come to help

721
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,539
That means, you really love our sect

722
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,575
Old man, I've got some information

723
00:48:16,677 --> 00:48:18,770
and I fought with No-mercy too

724
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:21,071
Her Yee Tin Sword is really powerful

725
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:22,642
Are you alright?

726
00:48:23,116 --> 00:48:25,175
Of course, I'll be alright

727
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:27,215
Set the position now

728
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:30,690
Someone who claims himself
the grandson of King of White Eagle

729
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:31,982
named Chang Mo-kei, just kill him
without a warning

730
00:48:32,192 --> 00:48:32,886
Yes

731
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:34,484
What did you say? My grandson?

732
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:37,855
They'll send someone to act as
your grandson to assassinate you

733
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:43,264
If our Holy Fire Table is still here

734
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:44,595
I won't scare her Yee Tin Sword

735
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:45,929
Bullshit

736
00:48:45,972 --> 00:48:48,202
If our Master Yeung didn't disappear

737
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:49,965
With his Magic Stance

738
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,668
he'd have killed them easily

739
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:57,073
It hurts

740
00:48:57,117 --> 00:48:58,584
Are you hurt?

741
00:48:58,719 --> 00:48:59,845
Of course

742
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,580
But I can't lose my face
in front of them

743
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:04,681
Never mind
I'll help you to cure your wound

744
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,119
It's useless, you've to suck the poison
out the wound

745
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:09,125
No problem

746
00:49:09,162 --> 00:49:09,958
Really?

747
00:49:09,996 --> 00:49:13,659
Yes, I didn't take my words back

748
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,496
What a good buddy

749
00:49:15,168 --> 00:49:16,601
See, the wound is on my ass

750
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,174
It's alright if you don't suck
but you shouldn't kick me

751
00:49:40,529 --> 00:49:41,461
So many people

752
00:49:41,764 --> 00:49:43,095
They don't seem to be the man
from Ming Sect

753
00:49:44,033 --> 00:49:44,761
Why are there so many flags?

754
00:49:47,603 --> 00:49:48,661
This is the code of our Sect

755
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:50,729
They've rushed into the forbidden zone
of the Elements Flag

756
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,031
Elements Flag?

757
00:50:55,304 --> 00:50:56,794
Don't retreat

758
00:50:57,139 --> 00:51:00,540
We're from decent schools
we can't be cowards

759
00:51:03,546 --> 00:51:04,945
If you want to be coward

760
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,808
you'll be killed

761
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:06,643
You're right

762
00:51:06,682 --> 00:51:07,706
You go first

763
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:09,548
Chi-yu, give me the Yee Tin Sword

764
00:51:10,019 --> 00:51:10,781
Yes, master

765
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,725
Go

766
00:51:34,543 --> 00:51:34,941
Retreat

767
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:39,079
Let's chase
