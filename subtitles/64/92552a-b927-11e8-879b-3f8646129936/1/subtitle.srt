1
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,879
Frost fills the sky over
Ten Mile Lake

2
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,816
Silken threads anxicus of
youth.

3
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:08,616
Looking at the moon and
feeling lonely.

4
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:11,950
Envious of love, not of
imortality.

5
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:16,254
This pointing will remind
you of me.

6
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:19,565
Sian's grave?!

7
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:23,062
Sian died long ago.

8
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,334
She's ghost?!

9
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:31,973
Yes! l'm a ghost but l bring
mortals no harm.

10
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,544
l died far away from my home

11
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,675
An evil spirit took by corpse and
won't let me rest in peace.

12
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:42,150
lf you want to save me, move
my bones away from here.

13
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,924
Then it will be possible for
me tobe reincarnated.

14
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,517
Sian!

15
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,122
l will save you.

16
00:01:54,037 --> 00:01:55,129
Sian!

17
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:56,869
Ning!

18
00:02:05,382 --> 00:02:06,679
Let them go, please.

19
00:02:10,253 --> 00:02:12,448
The Diamond Sutra!

20
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,926
We've escaped!
Sian, we're safe!

21
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:22,990
Dawn is breaking.

22
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,958
Sian, hide in the tower of ashes.

23
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:29,227
lf the sun's rays shine on
you, you'll never be reincarnated.

24
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:32,669
Ning, good-bye forever!

25
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:50,022
l hope that Sian will be reincarnated.

26
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,758
l must return to the Orchid
Buddhist Monastery.

27
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,528
lf you need me, you can find
me there. Take care!

28
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:10,635
Looking for the way,
the way of freedom.

29
00:03:10,814 --> 00:03:14,807
Sea and mountains,
l have traversed countless times.

30
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:17,881
A thousand paths,

31
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:22,083
all leading to my homeland.

32
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,951
The endless verdent mountains,

33
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:29,893
The mountains everywhere,
in howling wind and driving rain.

34
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,298
The path of the ancient garden.

35
00:03:33,903 --> 00:03:37,498
Why does it never end?

36
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:45,208
The way of the Tao, the way of freedom.

37
00:03:45,348 --> 00:03:49,341
Devils and demons always
pronounce themselves good.

38
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:52,620
The anger of youth

39
00:03:53,056 --> 00:03:56,651
Weeping ghosts and angry spritis,

40
00:03:57,394 --> 00:04:00,488
Times gone-by,

41
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:04,690
Why was there such a sea of blood?

42
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:07,866
The path of the ancient garden

43
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:12,068
Why can one never return on it?

44
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:19,404
Who is that young man?

45
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,814
He's the poor schoolar who
lived 2 blocks away.

46
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:24,952
Things have changed since he
was last here.

47
00:04:40,437 --> 00:04:43,235
Wasn't he that shop's bill
collector?

48
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,972
He doesn't even know it went
out of business long ago!

49
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:00,486
Welcome! Welcome!

50
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:33,352
The bill collector's here.

51
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,650
How much money did you collect?

52
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:36,951
We're here to catch escaped convicts.

53
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:38,285
lt's the police! Run!

54
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,326
Pursue them!

55
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,429
You're Bing Chow?!

56
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,365
You've made a mistake.
He has a beard and l don't!

57
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,559
You shaved it off!

58
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:49,727
Take him back and collect the reward.

59
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,004
Get in!

60
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,770
l haven't committed any crime!

61
00:05:54,143 --> 00:05:56,236
Let me got. l've been
wrongly accused!

62
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,379
Let me got l've been
wrongly accused!

63
00:05:58,982 --> 00:06:01,177
You're made a mistake.
l'm not Bing Chow!

64
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:03,181
l am wrongly accused!

65
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:19,800
My name is Ning,
not Bing Chow.

66
00:06:20,003 --> 00:06:21,095
Old man may l ask who...

67
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,237
A man just like you,
fated to being imprisoned.

68
00:06:27,577 --> 00:06:28,475
So pessimistic!

69
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:32,313
lt's all my elders' fault,
insisting l get an education

70
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,279
When l grew up, l was
learned and wrote books.

71
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:38,149
But when l write of my travels,
l'm accused of revealting state secrets.

72
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,750
When l write of history,
they say l'm satirizing the present.

73
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,718
lf l analyse milltary strategy,
they say l'm planning arebellion.

74
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,354
l can't even write fairy tales, for they
accuse me of promoting superstition.

75
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,994
Finally, l wrote the
biography of a powerful man.

76
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,493
Then he was arrested,
accused of being a rebel.

77
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,064
We here both sentenced to
life imprisonment.

78
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,169
Wouldn't you say that prison
is my fate?

79
00:07:00,677 --> 00:07:01,769
A cockroach!

80
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:02,867
Where?

81
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,678
Cockroach?!

82
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:11,009
You're really wasteful! The
cockroaches here are of the best quality.

83
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:12,951
There are no delicacies here

84
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:15,814
After you're been here a while,
you'll even salivate ever a housefly.

85
00:07:16,859 --> 00:07:18,053
Old man, how long have you
been here?

86
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:20,657
l was your age when
l first arrived.

87
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,229
Look how l've changed!
Full of character!

88
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,193
You've been here a long time

89
00:07:26,936 --> 00:07:29,234
Help! l am innocent!

90
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,931
l'm not Bing Chow!
l am innocent!

91
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:35,477
You've made a mistake.
l'm not Bing Chow!

92
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:08,736
Another nightmate.
What did you dream this time?

93
00:08:09,245 --> 00:08:10,439
l dreamt you were haggard
and exhausted.

94
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:12,808
Exhausted?! True, you will
soon be totally exhausted.

95
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,651
You have nightmares every night.
Look at the calendar.

96
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:19,286
You've been here so long and
still can't adjust.

97
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:21,219
Soon you'll even forget that
your last name is Chow.

98
00:08:21,758 --> 00:08:22,952
Old man, my last name
isn't Chow!

99
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,221
Bing Chow!

100
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,922
Supper!

101
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:30,397
OK.

102
00:08:34,837 --> 00:08:37,135
A chicken leg?!

103
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,240
Happy days are here again!

104
00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:43,873
Old man! There's only one
bowl. You eat first.

105
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,578
No, it's for you. l'd rather
eat cockroaches.

106
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,742
l'll tell you something when
you've finished.

107
00:08:49,018 --> 00:08:50,417
l haven't had chicken in
a long time.

108
00:08:51,354 --> 00:08:53,254
Old man, why are you carving
my name?

109
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,990
All these men ate chicken legs.

110
00:08:58,194 --> 00:08:59,786
We call that chicken a
headless chicken.

111
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,728
After you've eaten it, they
chop off your head!

112
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,065
Chop off your head?!

113
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:15,374
Bing Chow, we have no
personel quarrel.

114
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,068
Don't come back from the
greve and seek revenge on me

115
00:09:20,149 --> 00:09:23,550
They behead people at noon.
lt's now the middle of the night.

116
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:28,146
Some official's son got in trouble,
and they're looking for a substitute.

117
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:31,892
At night, the executioner
can't tell one from another.

118
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,397
ls there no justice in the world?

119
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:42,499
ls there no reward
for being a good man?

120
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:49,143
lt is of no concern to me.

121
00:10:00,923 --> 00:10:02,117
l was always an honest man.

122
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:03,986
l'll give you whatever l can

123
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:08,191
This painting was a gift
from my dearest one.

124
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:09,623
l don't want to part with it
even in death.

125
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,661
Young man, you have a good heart.

126
00:10:12,902 --> 00:10:14,893
Let me give you a present.

127
00:10:17,507 --> 00:10:18,906
You are so learned.

128
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:20,741
lt is fortunate that l die
rather than you.

129
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,807
You're a good man.
Such a pity you have to die.

130
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:24,469
lt would be a pity if you
died, not me.

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,874
Anybody's death is a pity.

132
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,505
You're a rare speciman.

133
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,574
lf you die, your type will be extinct.

134
00:10:29,786 --> 00:10:30,878
lt's been a long time since
l set somebody free.

135
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:33,582
This tunnel leads to the outside.

136
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,057
Go out and start a new.

137
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,327
Don't give me such false hopes.

138
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,630
lf this is an escape route,
why didn't you escape long ago?

139
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,965
lt's less troublesome for me
to write my book here.

140
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,396
When l finish, then l'll
escape and get it printed.

141
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,396
Don't worry about me.

142
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:51,400
Always keep this bundle
with you.

143
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:54,971
Once you're out of here,
never come back!

144
00:10:55,211 --> 00:10:56,906
Get going!

145
00:10:58,014 --> 00:10:59,311
What will happen to you
after l've gone?

146
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,315
They like hearing my stories

147
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,042
So long as l don't get to
the story's end,

148
00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:04,211
they'll never harm me.

149
00:11:04,353 --> 00:11:05,547
But they'll accuse you of
helping me escape.

150
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:09,213
l'll say you were put to
death for somebody else 2 days ago.

151
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,723
They won't dare make a fuse.

152
00:11:13,062 --> 00:11:14,359
Go!
Take care!

153
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:18,757
Bing Chow! The time has come

154
00:11:22,572 --> 00:11:23,561
Bing Chow!

155
00:11:23,673 --> 00:11:24,765
He's dead.

156
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,942
l've escaped!

157
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:50,495
There's even a horse here
waiting for me!

158
00:11:54,904 --> 00:11:57,600
That old man is really remarkable!

159
00:11:58,474 --> 00:11:59,964
l must repay his kindness someday.

160
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,140
Hey! That's my horse!

161
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,883
What a stupid horse!
Letting a stranger ride him!

162
00:12:10,586 --> 00:12:12,076
l don't even have time
to wash my hands!

163
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,325
You think you're fast over land...
l'll go underground!

164
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:20,222
Open sesame!

165
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,329
l must find a place to get
out of this downpour!

166
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,172
Good! A house!

167
00:12:37,413 --> 00:12:39,404
Open the door!

168
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,287
"Righteous Villa"...

169
00:12:58,768 --> 00:12:59,962
Anybody home?

170
00:13:05,241 --> 00:13:09,234
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

171
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:11,636
8 coffins! Must be the
whole family.

172
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,044
l won't disturb you.
l just want to stay the night.

173
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:20,049
Don't bother to get up.
l'll take care of myself.

174
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:27,621
l told you not to go any
trouble. Please go back!

175
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,624
The way you rush about in no
fixed direction!

176
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:35,299
l had a hard time following
you underground.

177
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:36,994
Don't you have any idea
where you're going?

178
00:13:38,474 --> 00:13:40,374
Your face looks so horrible,
you must have suffered a painful death.

179
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,001
lf you'd rushed around
underground all day like me,

180
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:45,243
you wouldn't have the energy
to come back to the surface.

181
00:13:50,586 --> 00:13:52,486
l don't know you. Why are
you following me?

182
00:13:52,588 --> 00:13:54,488
l don't know you either, so
why did you take my horse?

183
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,717
That's your horse?

184
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,955
l thought it was the
old man's.

185
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:02,790
Still you should have asked
before taking it.

186
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:06,299
You're alive! Sorry! lt's
all a misunderstanding.

187
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,100
lf there's anything l can do
to help, just let me know.

188
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,541
Enough of your tricks!
A good thing my reactions are so fast.

189
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:19,041
Friend, you need a place to
stay the night.

190
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:20,509
Here there's a roof over your head.
Might as well stay here.

191
00:14:21,584 --> 00:14:23,381
How do l know what you'd
do after l fell asleep?

192
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:30,516
l knew it!

193
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,557
Let's draw up some boundaries.
l'm staying next door.

194
00:14:34,964 --> 00:14:37,262
lf you have something to say
shout it! Don't come over.

195
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,612
l haven't bathed in a long time.

196
00:15:42,031 --> 00:15:46,331
The way

197
00:15:49,338 --> 00:15:51,533
The spoken "way" is not "way"

198
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:55,203
Of haven and earth,

199
00:15:56,312 --> 00:15:57,404
Of humang and swards

200
00:15:58,614 --> 00:15:59,706
Of evil and good,

201
00:15:59,782 --> 00:16:00,771
This way, that way, every which way

202
00:16:00,883 --> 00:16:01,679
Say that their way,

203
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,842
is the only way

204
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:05,180
Bah. Tehah, hah!

205
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:07,412
All bullshit,

206
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:13,417
This way, that way,

207
00:16:13,596 --> 00:16:14,585
is still not the way

208
00:16:14,864 --> 00:16:16,957
Ha! Ha!

209
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,155
The way of flowers and tea, Ha!

210
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,359
Of life and death,

211
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:20,457
Of density and intensity,

212
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,592
Of light and heat,

213
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,726
Of evil spirits

214
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:23,894
Of people committing crimes

215
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,734
Of bed ones in power! Ha!

216
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:28,072
l find my own way

217
00:16:28,577 --> 00:16:32,274
l seek

218
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,279
My way!

219
00:16:52,168 --> 00:16:53,362
Who is it?

220
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:58,362
Are you a mortal?

221
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:05,341
Hey, friend next door! Get
up! There's ghosts!

222
00:17:05,514 --> 00:17:07,311
Get up! Do you hear me?

223
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,742
Hurry and get up!

224
00:17:09,552 --> 00:17:10,746
Not a sound. Maybe he left already.

225
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:32,570
What a nuisance!

226
00:17:47,957 --> 00:17:49,754
Friend, there are fierce ghosts here!

227
00:17:49,825 --> 00:17:51,725
Ghosts? l'll use my maglo to
banish them!

228
00:17:56,632 --> 00:18:00,830
Ghosts and goblins,
l order you to leave!

229
00:18:05,741 --> 00:18:07,936
Oh, you understand the occult!

230
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:11,037
My nose is sensitive to
other worldly spirits...

231
00:18:11,513 --> 00:18:12,810
So why do l smell nothing now?

232
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:14,945
Get out of the way!

233
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:18,278
Abracadabra!

234
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:22,880
Strange! Not even a hint of
ghostly odour!

235
00:18:23,626 --> 00:18:25,924
Abracadabra! Hocus-pocus
flash!

236
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:36,532
Abracadabra!

237
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:42,074
Abracadabra!

238
00:18:44,146 --> 00:18:45,443
Don't come here!
Leave!

239
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,325
You're not even real ghosts!
Wasting my occult talents.

240
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:04,855
Phonies?

241
00:19:19,515 --> 00:19:20,607
Want to trick me?

242
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:28,922
A good thing you have a
waistband.

243
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:42,031
Stay away from me!

244
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,995
l'm falling...

245
00:19:46,108 --> 00:19:48,406
Stop hugging me!

246
00:19:51,113 --> 00:19:52,102
Let go!

247
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:53,475
lf l let go, l'll fall!

248
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,377
lf you don't let go, l'll...

249
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:25,407
Sian?!

250
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:28,979
Sian!

251
00:20:33,856 --> 00:20:38,850
Hocus-pocus heebie-jeebie!
l order you to freeze!

252
00:20:40,496 --> 00:20:41,485
Freeze!

253
00:20:42,664 --> 00:20:44,757
Freeze!

254
00:20:45,634 --> 00:20:46,726
Sian, is that you?

255
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,070
What kind of black magic is
that? Let them go!

256
00:20:50,572 --> 00:20:51,766
Otherwise l'll kill him.

257
00:20:52,207 --> 00:20:53,504
Oh... Freeze!

258
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,201
Kill him! He's no friend of mine!

259
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:05,381
Elder Chu! Are you Elder Chu,
travelling incognito?

260
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,115
Elder who?

261
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:08,648
Your disciple is deeply sorry.

262
00:21:09,591 --> 00:21:10,683
Disciple?!

263
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:13,121
Elder Chu?!

264
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,524
Sian, it's me! Don't you
recognize me?

265
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,895
We come from a good family.
My name is Windy.

266
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,297
This is my younger sister,
Moon.

267
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:23,963
Elder Chu.

268
00:21:24,773 --> 00:21:26,365
Elder, you can save us.

269
00:21:26,508 --> 00:21:28,305
My father is Lord Fu, the
ex-Minister of Rites.

270
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,977
He was framed. They're now
transporting him to be executed.

271
00:21:31,113 --> 00:21:33,013
We want to attack the
transport wagon and rescue him.

272
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:37,081
You are the learned and
brilliant Chu.

273
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:39,514
You two are loyal imperial warriors.

274
00:21:39,888 --> 00:21:41,082
Everyone is an eminent personnage.

275
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,487
Now it's my turn to
introduce myself,

276
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:46,159
I am... Spell!

277
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,965
My name is Autumn,
from the Kunlun sact.

278
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:55,893
l've read everything that
the Elder has written.

279
00:21:56,305 --> 00:21:57,704
l only use my magic to battle demons.

280
00:21:57,973 --> 00:21:59,372
l never get involved in
affairs of state.

281
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,674
We pay our respects to Elder Chu.

282
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:06,480
My name is Ning, not Chu.

283
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:08,749
l can tell you are clever.

284
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:10,374
Clever people do not always
reveal their identities.

285
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:12,452
Anyway, in our hearts we
know who you really are.

286
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:15,479
How can l make you believe
me?

287
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:18,150
No need for you to say
anything. Everybody remember

288
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,260
From now on, Elder Chu will
be known as Ning.

289
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:22,019
Chu is Ning.

290
00:22:22,197 --> 00:22:23,186
Yes!

291
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:28,227
We will now take an oath.

292
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:29,903
Whoever reveal their identities will be
chopped up into 10,000 pieces.

293
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:31,431
Yes!

294
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:35,542
Such an honour that you rode
my horse!

295
00:22:42,451 --> 00:22:45,249
Sian, do you remember this
painting and poem?

296
00:22:46,355 --> 00:22:49,347
Sian? Poem?

297
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,820
He's reciting poetry.
Quickly, pen and paper.

298
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,689
We must record what he says.
Elder is giving us a hint.

299
00:22:54,196 --> 00:22:55,595
Hurry!

300
00:22:57,933 --> 00:22:59,924
Frost fills the sky over 10
Mile Lake;

301
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:02,428
Silken threads anxious of youth.

302
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:05,198
Looking at the moon and
feeling lonely;

303
00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:07,965
Envious of lovers, not of
immortality.

304
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:10,872
Very profound!

305
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:13,342
What does "10 mile" mean?

306
00:23:13,815 --> 00:23:16,409
10 mile!

307
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,386
lt is all very deep.

308
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:24,086
His words are too profound!

309
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,323
10 Mile? That must mean 10
Mile Pavilion.

310
00:23:30,732 --> 00:23:31,926
There's a 10 Mile Pavilion
near hear.

311
00:23:33,402 --> 00:23:38,203
That's right! Sister, "10 miles"
refers to 10 Mile Pavilion.

312
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:39,271
lt's nearby.

313
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,406
l understand. 10 Mile Pavilion
is not far from here.

314
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:48,275
"Frost" refers to Frost's
Descent.

315
00:23:48,684 --> 00:23:49,981
Each year has 24 climatic
periods...

316
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:52,014
After the autumnal equinox
comes the frost...

317
00:23:52,254 --> 00:23:53,653
and today is the day of
Frost's Descent.

318
00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,483
Elder is telling us that father will be
transported past 10 Mile Pavilion.

319
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:57,681
He's telling us to rescue him there.

320
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,556
Elder is truly perceptive.
We can save father.

321
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:04,762
We had it right!

322
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,130
Good.

323
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,735
lt hurts!

324
00:24:09,137 --> 00:24:10,832
What's the matter? Get up!

325
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,637
Reporting!

326
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:17,310
Miss Windy! Your father will pass
the 10 Mile Pavilion tonight.

327
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:18,907
We already know that.

328
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:21,407
Elder is truly brilliant!

329
00:24:23,452 --> 00:24:26,148
But what about the rest of the poem?
What do those 2 stanzas mean

330
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,117
3 stanzas.

331
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:28,483
The meaning doesn't matter now.

332
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,784
lnterpret it in any way you desire.

333
00:24:30,392 --> 00:24:32,292
He means that we should have
our own views...

334
00:24:32,494 --> 00:24:34,394
not just listen to what
other people say, right?

335
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,927
So, should we still listen
to what Elder says?

336
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,589
Not only listen, but take
notes and ponder his meaning

337
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:40,462
We must pass his wisdom on
to future generations.

338
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:41,467
Right!

339
00:24:41,637 --> 00:24:43,332
Time to leave!

340
00:24:43,872 --> 00:24:44,964
Good-bye.

341
00:24:45,407 --> 00:24:46,601
We're off to 10 Mile
Pavilion.

342
00:24:46,675 --> 00:24:47,767
Yes. We're off to 10 Mile
Pavilion.

343
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,710
Miss Windy, please return
Sian's painting to me.

344
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:54,741
Yes, Elder.

345
00:24:57,719 --> 00:25:00,210
When you call me Sian, is
that a hint that l need a pseudonym?

346
00:25:01,023 --> 00:25:02,422
From now on, my name is Sian

347
00:25:09,297 --> 00:25:13,791
lf Sian were reincarnated,
she would now be a babe in arms.

348
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:20,071
She's not Sian!

349
00:25:41,897 --> 00:25:42,989
What are you spying on?

350
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:48,094
Me?... Nothing.

351
00:25:56,912 --> 00:25:58,106
What are you spying on?

352
00:26:00,482 --> 00:26:02,973
l wanted to see what you
were spying on. Time to go!

353
00:26:04,453 --> 00:26:06,751
Do you think your fiance,
Prince Ma...

354
00:26:06,988 --> 00:26:07,886
is as handsome as Elder?

355
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,188
We were betrothed before birth.
How do l know what he looks like?

356
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:13,223
ls that what people mean by fate?

357
00:26:14,629 --> 00:26:15,926
Who are you referring to?

358
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:19,398
Oh, nobody. lt's just that l
feel so fortunate.

359
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,665
Fortunate? You're frothing
at the mouth!

360
00:26:49,931 --> 00:26:50,920
Evil spirits!

361
00:26:59,007 --> 00:27:01,305
ls this a foot print or a hand print?

362
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:02,937
We'll know when we find the
monster.

363
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:04,777
Right!

364
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:10,981
lt even harmad a man.

365
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:13,546
What a pity to leave it here
Better show it to Elder.

366
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:16,785
OK! There really are ghosts
in this place!

367
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:18,957
What is that?

368
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:20,891
A corpse! lt's all that
ghost's fault.

369
00:27:21,062 --> 00:27:22,461
Don't hug it. Put it down.

370
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,327
How did this person die so
pitifully?

371
00:27:26,434 --> 00:27:28,834
l'd say this an evil ghost.
The odour is very strong.

372
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,798
lt's back!

373
00:27:32,007 --> 00:27:33,201
ls it looking for us?

374
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:34,573
Use your "freeze" magic.

375
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:35,732
Right!

376
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:38,807
l command you to freeze!

377
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:46,243
Heebie-jeebie! Freeze!
That'll stop him!

378
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:50,154
How do you do it?

379
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:52,690
When you see a ghost, shout "freeze".

380
00:27:53,428 --> 00:27:55,919
Like this? Freeze! ls that right?

381
00:27:56,698 --> 00:28:03,797
Oh, no! How do you lift the spell?

382
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:10,443
l have to think of a way to
communicate with him.

383
00:28:10,579 --> 00:28:12,979
What can l do? Let's try
this...

384
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:15,343
lf l'm right, move your eyes
up and down.

385
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:16,878
That's right! Fantastic!

386
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:19,646
lf l'm wrong, move them from
left to right.

387
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:21,115
Great!

388
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,882
Will a hand gesture lift
the spell?

389
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:38,767
What? Not up and down or
left to right.

390
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:42,070
Don't joke with me.

391
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,401
lf we wait too long, that
monster will get us.

392
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,878
Does lifting the spell have
to do with an acupuncture point?

393
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,749
Your eyes are moving faster
than a revolving lantern!

394
00:28:52,554 --> 00:28:55,853
l understand! You're
provoking me into hitting you.

395
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:58,958
OK. l'm going to hit you now

396
00:28:59,861 --> 00:29:00,850
Ready or not, here it comes!

397
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:13,806
Let's get out of here!

398
00:29:17,946 --> 00:29:19,038
Come on!

399
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:28,415
You're too heavy. l can't carry you.

400
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:35,927
Drag it! Dragging you isn't fast
enough either.

401
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:37,723
Better hide upstairs.

402
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:50,538
l told you not to fool
around at a time like this.

403
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,444
That monster is so tall,
it'll see us if he stand up straight.

404
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:03,282
How can l undo the spell?

405
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:09,395
lt's safer inside. Better
hide yourself quick.

406
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:24,170
l told you to hide inside.

407
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:26,179
Why did you go down there,
where it's so dangerous?

408
00:31:05,086 --> 00:31:08,783
Try the "freeze" curse!
Freeze!

409
00:31:19,534 --> 00:31:21,126
Let's continue with out
guessing game.

410
00:31:23,371 --> 00:31:25,464
You're getting heavier and
heavier. Can't carry you much longer.

411
00:31:26,808 --> 00:31:28,105
Since that monster isn't here...

412
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,801
let's try to lift the spell.

413
00:31:33,014 --> 00:31:34,413
Does it have anything to do
with this amulet?

414
00:31:36,684 --> 00:31:38,083
Yes?! What then?

415
00:31:40,588 --> 00:31:43,284
Point at me. Point at me and
the curse will be lifted.

416
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,517
Point!

417
00:31:48,897 --> 00:31:54,995
How do l undo the spell?

418
00:32:09,584 --> 00:32:11,882
Freeze!

419
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:22,596
Don't move!... Move! Move!

420
00:32:23,098 --> 00:32:24,395
Don't move!

421
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:28,892
Why does he "unfreeze" so quickly,

422
00:32:29,137 --> 00:32:30,729
but you haven't moved for so long?

423
00:32:31,773 --> 00:32:36,369
Do you mean... I pointed to
this amulet...

424
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:39,178
Then l asked you how to lift
the spell...

425
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:42,811
And he moved! Freeze!

426
00:33:47,682 --> 00:33:49,081
l'll take care of it.
Get out of here fast!

427
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:51,807
Finally lifted the spell!

428
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:54,952
Get out of here!

429
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,753
Abracadabra! Open up a way out!

430
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,758
Abracadabra! Open up a way out!

431
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,130
Out of the way! l'll take care of it!

432
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,003
Abracadabra!

433
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:24,550
Hocus pocus!

434
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,837
l order all ghosts to be expelled!

435
00:35:00,021 --> 00:35:01,511
Wow! lt doesn't fear my
incantations!

436
00:35:13,868 --> 00:35:14,857
lt's still moving!

437
00:35:15,737 --> 00:35:17,637
l order all ghosts to be
expelled!

438
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:35,821
Even when it's chopped up he
can still run away!

439
00:35:36,024 --> 00:35:37,218
lt could still come back at
any time.

440
00:35:37,759 --> 00:35:39,750
Elder, get out of here.
l'll pursue it!

441
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:40,924
Be careful!

442
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:41,993
Earth, open up!

443
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:46,183
Hey! Stop! Stop!

444
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:48,692
Are you stupid? l told you to stop!

445
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,321
We don't even know each other.
Why are we fighting?

446
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,867
l learned magic to deal with
evil spirits.

447
00:36:54,969 --> 00:36:57,460
If you don't stop, I'll use
my magic to "freeze" you.

448
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:00,768
Why are you blocking my way?

449
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:02,534
l was just taking a rest
after battling some ghosts,

450
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,009
and you say l'm blocking
your way.

451
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,975
When that monster makes a run for it
tonight, you'll be in deep trouble.

452
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:06,943
Brother!

453
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:08,037
Call me Master.

454
00:37:08,416 --> 00:37:09,314
Master, your skill is extraordinary.

455
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:12,146
lf you worked for the imperial court,
your future would be boundless.

456
00:37:13,421 --> 00:37:15,616
You know that l'm a
Taoist monk.

457
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:19,256
Seeking wealth and position
is for the likes of you mere mortals.

458
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,553
I don't want to end up like
you... Earth, open up!

459
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:27,864
What a pity.

460
00:37:28,035 --> 00:37:31,436
Hu, our horses' hoofs are
rigid. They won't move!

461
00:37:36,544 --> 00:37:38,239
lt must be that monk's
magic at work!

462
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,774
He said there are evil
spirits. Be careful!

463
00:37:40,882 --> 00:37:41,780
Yes!

464
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:55,556
Lord Fu!

465
00:37:56,431 --> 00:37:59,525
There's nothing l can do
about squabbles in the imperial court.

466
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:04,163
lt's hard to tell right from wrong.
l'm just following orders.

467
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,833
But don't worry.

468
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:08,967
l'll make sure your journey is safe.

469
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,171
After we get to the capital,

470
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:14,746
whatever the emperor does to
you is not my responsibility

471
00:38:20,188 --> 00:38:21,485
Let's go!

472
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,563
Where can l get something to eat?

473
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,934
Please give me a bowl of
your cheapest food.

474
00:38:41,075 --> 00:38:42,167
What? The cheapest?

475
00:38:42,543 --> 00:38:46,138
Sit down! lf you're starving
don't waste your money.

476
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:50,315
Show me your face.

477
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:51,879
Go!

478
00:38:52,186 --> 00:38:53,380
Stand up.

479
00:38:54,255 --> 00:38:56,450
Don't lower your head.

480
00:38:57,124 --> 00:38:58,022
Go!

481
00:38:58,192 --> 00:38:59,090
Go!

482
00:39:01,696 --> 00:39:03,095
Don't run away!

483
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:04,186
Don't move!

484
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:11,263
Monks?

485
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:13,899
Don't move!

486
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:16,101
Stand still!

487
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:28,351
Out of the way!

488
00:39:28,723 --> 00:39:29,712
Get out of the way!

489
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,967
What kind of magic is this?

490
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:12,295
lt's Windy...

491
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:16,663
Come back!

492
00:40:17,204 --> 00:40:19,104
Hey!

493
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:23,137
The soldiers never come to
10 Mile Pavilion last night.

494
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:24,505
Rush back to Righteous Villa
and lie in ambush for them.

495
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:28,879
Hey!

496
00:40:29,984 --> 00:40:31,679
Back to Righteous Villa?
lt's haunted!

497
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,384
Come back!

498
00:40:41,796 --> 00:40:43,889
Elder! Elder!

499
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:46,722
l wonder if Elder has
already gone?

500
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:47,957
Better search for him.

501
00:40:48,102 --> 00:40:48,898
Yes!

502
00:40:52,273 --> 00:40:54,468
Do you think father's
transport has already passed by here?

503
00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:57,907
No. They're not supposed to
reach here until after dark.

504
00:40:58,346 --> 00:41:00,746
Miss Windy, the villa has
been ransacked.

505
00:41:01,482 --> 00:41:03,473
l'm sure Elder did it to
remove any traces of our presence.

506
00:41:03,651 --> 00:41:04,549
Set everything up. Prepare
to attack.

507
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:05,548
Yes!

508
00:41:05,653 --> 00:41:06,847
Hurry up! Over there!

509
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:56,328
Who is it?

510
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:57,459
Who is it?

511
00:41:58,339 --> 00:42:00,330
l'm Ning.
Ning?

512
00:42:03,077 --> 00:42:04,374
Oh, it's Elder!

513
00:42:04,745 --> 00:42:05,837
This villa is haunted.

514
00:42:06,147 --> 00:42:07,239
Haunted?

515
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:08,246
Where is Miss Windy?

516
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:09,338
lnside.

517
00:42:10,351 --> 00:42:11,147
Ghosts?

518
00:42:11,218 --> 00:42:12,207
Real ghosts?

519
00:42:34,675 --> 00:42:35,664
Miss Windy!

520
00:42:36,777 --> 00:42:37,869
My clothes!

521
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:41,506
Miss Windy!

522
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:44,440
Miss Windy!

523
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:51,388
Elder, they said you came.

524
00:42:53,227 --> 00:42:54,216
Miss Moon!

525
00:42:54,328 --> 00:42:55,226
Who are you?

526
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:03,993
Oh, it's Elder. l recognize
your back.

527
00:43:04,572 --> 00:43:05,470
Elder...

528
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:09,536
l...

529
00:43:14,582 --> 00:43:16,379
With your beard shaved off,
you're so, so...

530
00:43:16,951 --> 00:43:18,441
Yes.

531
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,011
When my sister sees you,
she'll be so happy for me.

532
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,379
Happy?!

533
00:43:24,525 --> 00:43:26,117
When you came in, did you
see my sister?

534
00:43:26,594 --> 00:43:28,494
Your sister? No. No!

535
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:33,094
Sister! Sister! Sister!

536
00:43:36,003 --> 00:43:37,197
What are you grinning about?

537
00:43:37,605 --> 00:43:38,697
lt is improper to look.

538
00:43:43,344 --> 00:43:45,744
There are some things you
shouldn't look at.

539
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,374
You're all right!

540
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:50,175
l didn't recognize Elder
with his beard shaved off.

541
00:43:50,384 --> 00:43:51,681
Really? l must see for
myself.

542
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:53,876
Elder, if you have something
to say, just say it.

543
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:56,045
lt scares me when you hint
at things.

544
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:57,417
l'm cold.

545
00:43:57,792 --> 00:43:59,692
Your face is so hot, how
can you be cold?

546
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:02,888
Wouldn't this be faster?

547
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:04,360
Not fast enough. Faster
would be better.

548
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,065
Faster?!... OK.

549
00:44:13,207 --> 00:44:14,504
Elder...

550
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,342
Elder said he was cold.

551
00:44:20,114 --> 00:44:21,103
Cold?

552
00:44:22,516 --> 00:44:24,416
Elder, you're overly
exerting yourself.

553
00:44:34,161 --> 00:44:36,459
Have you seen Miss Windy?

554
00:44:36,831 --> 00:44:38,321
No, l'm looking for her too.

555
00:44:39,233 --> 00:44:40,427
Where did she go?

556
00:44:44,038 --> 00:44:45,335
There's noise coming from upstairs.
Let's go up for a look.

557
00:45:04,558 --> 00:45:05,650
Don't go up there.

558
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:09,726
Strange! Nobody up here.

559
00:45:13,868 --> 00:45:15,460
Maybe it's next door.
Let's go over and look.

560
00:45:28,916 --> 00:45:30,213
What are you doing?

561
00:45:30,317 --> 00:45:32,512
Sister, Elder came back to
find me... us.

562
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,511
Why are your clothes so
dishevelled?

563
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:38,755
Don't be so impolite in
the future.

564
00:45:44,698 --> 00:45:46,598
Miss Windy, this villa is
haunted.

565
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:48,991
Do we still have to pretend
to be ghosts?

566
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,563
No matter what, we must wait
here for father.

567
00:45:51,972 --> 00:45:53,462
We mustn't leave.

568
00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:55,864
ln this moment of danger,

569
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,409
we must thrust out our
chests and be fearless.

570
00:45:57,578 --> 00:45:59,569
We must be utterly devoted
to our cause.

571
00:46:02,483 --> 00:46:04,383
Elder, let's go in.

572
00:46:07,488 --> 00:46:08,284
Elder!

573
00:46:08,422 --> 00:46:09,616
Your clothes are
torn in the back.

574
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,503
How do you write the
"freeze" incantation?

575
00:46:39,186 --> 00:46:42,587
l didn't spy on him.l didn't
even know he was outside.

576
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:45,788
Better tie your heart down.

577
00:46:45,993 --> 00:46:47,483
Otherwise, it might fly away

578
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:49,117
lf l could tie it down, l would!

579
00:47:03,844 --> 00:47:05,835
This is how you do it...

580
00:47:15,255 --> 00:47:16,347
lt works!

581
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:23,228
This is the "freeze"
incantation.

582
00:47:23,397 --> 00:47:26,093
lf you see that monster, do
this and he'll freeze in his tracks.

583
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:27,062
Like this?

584
00:47:27,234 --> 00:47:29,031
Don't do it haphazardly.This
spell is hard to reverse.

585
00:47:29,136 --> 00:47:30,831
Give me your hand.
Yes!

586
00:47:43,217 --> 00:47:44,206
Sister, what's that sound?

587
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:58,130
lt's coming from up there.
Windy!

588
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:01,430
Windy, give me your hand.

589
00:48:01,802 --> 00:48:03,394
Elder, shouldn't you be
calling me Sian?

590
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,265
Whether l call you Sian or
Windy, there's no need to be bashful.

591
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:07,603
l'll never reveal what
happened just now.

592
00:48:08,542 --> 00:48:09,941
l was really anxious on
your behalf.

593
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:13,975
Actually, l kissed you
because l couldn't control myself.

594
00:48:14,148 --> 00:48:15,342
Fortunately you made a
quick get-away.

595
00:48:15,749 --> 00:48:17,444
Otherwise, if Moon had seen
you undressed and with me...

596
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:20,146
it would be hard to explain,
even if l were Elder Chu.

597
00:48:20,988 --> 00:48:22,387
Give me your hand.

598
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:24,182
Moon?!

599
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:26,982
Moon, what are you doing here?

600
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:29,687
l was looking for you.

601
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:30,819
Don't bother explaining.

602
00:48:31,498 --> 00:48:32,795
Moon!

603
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,500
No, Windy! Give me your hand

604
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:38,795
We're not fated for each other.
l'm betrothed to Lord Ma's son.

605
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:41,037
You're betrothed?

606
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:42,300
We weren't meant for each other.

607
00:48:42,409 --> 00:48:44,809
You should be looking for
Moon, not me.

608
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:49,805
Windy, one at a time. l'm
after both of you.

609
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:00,587
Miss Moon, it's getting dark
Give me your hand.

610
00:49:01,562 --> 00:49:02,756
Go to my sister instead.

611
00:49:03,864 --> 00:49:05,957
l'll go to her next. Quick,
give me your hand.

612
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,732
Elder, aren't you the playboy!

613
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:09,300
You can only choose one of us.

614
00:49:09,536 --> 00:49:10,628
l'm not going to compete
with my sister.

615
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:15,307
No need to compete. When l
finish with you l'll go to her.

616
00:49:34,495 --> 00:49:37,487
Elder, there is something
l must tell you.

617
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:40,832
Actually, love is a strange thing.

618
00:49:41,969 --> 00:49:45,166
My heart beats wildly when
l look at you.

619
00:49:46,106 --> 00:49:51,100
l don't even have the
courage to glance at you.

620
00:49:54,515 --> 00:49:57,712
l'm afraid that my heart
would jump right out.

621
00:50:11,331 --> 00:50:12,229
Help!

622
00:50:12,466 --> 00:50:13,558
What's that?

623
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,157
Hurry up! That monster is back.

624
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:20,337
Go inside and search.

625
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,338
Yes!

626
00:50:22,976 --> 00:50:24,967
lnside there's a huge creature.

627
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:26,339
l don't know what it is.

628
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:36,788
Be calm! Use the "freeze"
incantation.

629
00:50:36,957 --> 00:50:38,049
Together: Freeze!

630
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:43,759
lt sure does!

631
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:53,970
We froze it in its tracks.

632
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:03,143
Everybody, jump up there!

633
00:51:18,398 --> 00:51:19,592
The archery machine!

634
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,372
Be careful!
Elder!

635
00:51:52,866 --> 00:51:54,561
Moon, go and rescue Elder.
l'll lure away that monster.

636
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:55,699
Yes!

637
00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:03,601
Put out the net.

638
00:52:07,047 --> 00:52:08,344
Your hand...

639
00:52:22,462 --> 00:52:23,554
Let's retreat from here.

640
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:31,033
See what's going on up ahead

641
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:32,002
Yes!

642
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:35,904
Soldiers!

643
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:37,168
Hu, they've set up an ambush

644
00:52:40,047 --> 00:52:41,344
Windy, Moon?!

645
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:42,974
lt's father!

646
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,847
Lure the soldiers into the villa.

647
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,248
Use the archery machine to
mow them down!

648
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:51,184
Trying to get away?

649
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,650
The monster destroyed the
archery machine!

650
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:55,920
We're surrounded by our toes

651
00:52:57,597 --> 00:52:59,497
Let me out!

652
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,032
Right!... Let Elder go!

653
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:02,760
Elder, what should we do now?

654
00:53:02,903 --> 00:53:03,801
We'll stay on the sidelines.

655
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,767
When the enemy comes in, the
monster will deal with them.

656
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:17,415
Obviously a fake ghost. Unmask it.

657
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,787
Let's rescue father!
Yes!

658
00:53:35,001 --> 00:53:35,990
You're hopelessly outnumbered.

659
00:53:45,278 --> 00:53:46,472
l'll save you!

660
00:53:49,116 --> 00:53:52,313
Swords are too dangerous!
Let's use our fists.

661
00:54:06,933 --> 00:54:08,833
l told you that swords are
too dangerous!

662
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:31,849
Father!

663
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:33,551
Get out of here. Don't worry
about me!

664
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:38,922
Don't worry about me! Rescue father!

665
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,336
The monster is here!

666
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,936
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

667
00:54:53,346 --> 00:54:54,643
Abraoadabra! Hocus pocus!

668
00:54:58,852 --> 00:55:00,149
Windy! Windy!

669
00:55:01,121 --> 00:55:02,110
Possessed by evil spirits?!

670
00:55:02,389 --> 00:55:03,481
Sister!

671
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:04,419
What happened to Windy?

672
00:55:04,591 --> 00:55:05,387
She's been possessed by
evil spirits.

673
00:55:05,492 --> 00:55:06,288
What should we do?

674
00:55:06,393 --> 00:55:09,294
Still a lot of soldiers
around. Better get inside.

675
00:55:12,999 --> 00:55:13,988
Don't move!

676
00:55:14,601 --> 00:55:16,068
Press down on her!

677
00:55:16,102 --> 00:55:17,592
Sister!

678
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:19,430
Think of a way to save
my sister.

679
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,239
She's possessed by the evil spirits.

680
00:55:21,441 --> 00:55:23,033
She could turn into a giant
monster at any moment.

681
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,000
lt's your fault, you traitor.

682
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,110
l'll kill you!

683
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:28,437
Wait! His troops are still out there.

684
00:55:28,615 --> 00:55:30,310
We must keep him as a hostage.

685
00:55:33,019 --> 00:55:35,214
She's turning into a corpse
monster!

686
00:55:36,423 --> 00:55:37,219
Sister!

687
00:55:37,324 --> 00:55:38,814
We must kill her immediately

688
00:55:38,992 --> 00:55:39,788
Otherwise she'll turn into a monster.

689
00:55:39,893 --> 00:55:41,087
You can't kill her!

690
00:55:41,761 --> 00:55:43,058
Are you a good person or evil?

691
00:55:43,263 --> 00:55:44,560
You won't kill Hu, but
you'll kill my sister.

692
00:55:44,865 --> 00:55:45,763
Kill Hu!

693
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,790
No matter how many you kill here,
you still won't save the kingdom.

694
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:52,561
The emperor has no idea of
the suffering of his people.

695
00:55:53,106 --> 00:55:55,097
Take my head to the emperor.
Maybe it will move him.

696
00:55:55,308 --> 00:55:58,402
He'll be convinced of our
sincerity and loyalty.

697
00:55:58,578 --> 00:56:01,172
Father, if you die we'll
have no one to lead us.

698
00:56:01,448 --> 00:56:02,642
Take my head instead.

699
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,816
No! Take our heads.

700
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:07,115
Bastards! What good is it to
cut off your heads?

701
00:56:07,721 --> 00:56:09,018
Who are you, ordering people
about?!

702
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:11,517
l am the learned and
brilliant Elder Chu!

703
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,184
The learned and brilliant
Elder Chu.

704
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,195
Please guide us.

705
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:24,192
None of you are permitted to die.

706
00:56:24,304 --> 00:56:25,100
Please explain!

707
00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:26,103
Explain?!

708
00:56:26,373 --> 00:56:28,068
Your severed heads will mean
nothing to the emperor.

709
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:29,607
You'll have died in vain.
Need l explain more?

710
00:56:29,743 --> 00:56:30,835
Stupid pigs!

711
00:56:32,012 --> 00:56:33,604
What about her?

712
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,553
To exorcise her, she needs
a dose of "yang" energy.

713
00:56:50,897 --> 00:56:51,989
l am not powerful enough.

714
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,430
We better do something soon
or it will be too late.

715
00:56:54,668 --> 00:56:55,760
What can we do?

716
00:56:55,835 --> 00:56:57,234
Try this magic charm. lt may
or may not work.

717
00:56:57,304 --> 00:56:58,601
Hurry up and pull Miss Windy down.

718
00:56:58,672 --> 00:56:59,570
OK.

719
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,612
l order the evil spirits to
be exercised.

720
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:30,528
How did this happen?

721
00:57:35,342 --> 00:57:36,331
l've forced the evil spirit from her.

722
00:57:36,476 --> 00:57:38,467
If she gets a quick dose of "yang"
energy, there will be a gleam of hope.

723
00:57:38,645 --> 00:57:39,839
Hurry up.

724
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,072
Hurry!

725
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:43,339
l'm a monk. l must not get
too close to women.

726
00:57:43,683 --> 00:57:45,674
Don't be afraid of her ugliness.

727
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:46,748
How do we give her "yang" energy?

728
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:48,047
With your mouth, of course.

729
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:49,019
Mouth?

730
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:50,247
What then? Your ears?

731
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,882
Send me to her.

732
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:54,723
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

733
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:48,739
Sister!

734
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:58,218
A real man is afraid of nothing.

735
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:26,684
Lord, a golden-robed priest
is on his way here.

736
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:29,682
A golden-robed priest?

737
00:59:47,607 --> 00:59:48,699
Put your swords down!

738
00:59:51,945 --> 00:59:55,039
Not enough! More!

739
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:58,244
Lower your swords!

740
00:59:58,885 --> 00:59:59,783
Put all your swords down!

741
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:08,121
There are evildoers behind
every country's downfall.

742
01:00:08,628 --> 01:00:10,721
Take my head and collect
your reward.

743
01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:21,403
The way that you look death
calmly in the face,

744
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:23,005
proves that you are loyal to
our country.

745
01:00:25,245 --> 01:00:26,735
Even though our political
views are different,

746
01:00:27,647 --> 01:00:29,638
l'm still willing to help you.

747
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,047
The golden-robed Taoist
outside is the High Priest.

748
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:35,980
The High Priest?

749
01:00:36,222 --> 01:00:38,315
All the rites and rituals in
the palace...

750
01:00:39,058 --> 01:00:41,151
the emperor consults him
for guidance.

751
01:00:41,361 --> 01:00:43,955
lf he speaks on your behalf,
justice will triumph.

752
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:46,557
Father!

753
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:52,461
Lord Fu, if you trust me,
let me go to him.

754
01:00:53,439 --> 01:00:54,633
l'll explain the true situation.

755
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:02,446
Father, he might betray you!

756
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:04,973
He could have killed me had
he wanted to.

757
01:01:10,323 --> 01:01:11,722
Still not awake?!

758
01:01:13,526 --> 01:01:15,824
Enough! l'm going to puke.

759
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:19,454
Elder!

760
01:01:52,298 --> 01:01:54,198
l am here to pay my respects
to the high priest.

761
01:01:54,634 --> 01:01:57,228
Lord Fu is not a traitor.

762
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:59,530
He is a loyal subject, a patriot.

763
01:02:00,006 --> 01:02:01,303
l hope that you will uphold justice.

764
01:02:02,475 --> 01:02:05,967
There are many who cannot
tell between good and evil.

765
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,579
They do not know the
hardships of the imperial court.

766
01:02:08,948 --> 01:02:11,644
The purpose of my journey
is to pacify the people.

767
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:16,952
l'll intercede at court on
behalf of these loyal subjects.

768
01:02:17,423 --> 01:02:18,481
Amen! Amen!

769
01:02:18,524 --> 01:02:19,513
Thank you, High Priest!

770
01:02:41,781 --> 01:02:43,271
How are you, Autumn?

771
01:02:47,787 --> 01:02:50,278
Women are very tempting.
lf l didn't exercise self-control...

772
01:02:51,057 --> 01:02:52,547
my energy would have been dissipated.

773
01:02:56,796 --> 01:02:59,993
Hu is treacherous and disrupts
the High Priest's harmony.

774
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:01,188
Please stay here.

775
01:03:25,224 --> 01:03:28,216
The convict Lord Fu is here
to see the High Priest.

776
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:30,051
l pay my respects to the High Priest.

777
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:33,925
Amen! Amen! You have a
murderous air about you.

778
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:37,264
Put down your weapons.

779
01:03:37,837 --> 01:03:40,635
l've been framed, but l am
concerned about our nation.

780
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:45,603
You're so merciful.Guide the
emperor to save the nation.

781
01:03:46,112 --> 01:03:49,104
Life is chaotic.

782
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:52,750
Mistakes can always be corrected.

783
01:04:29,489 --> 01:04:33,983
ln my former life l was evil
so l must do good in this life.

784
01:04:37,964 --> 01:04:41,263
Release my soul from purgatory.

785
01:04:41,968 --> 01:04:43,663
Release my soul from purgatory.

786
01:04:57,517 --> 01:04:58,609
Evil chanting?!

787
01:05:01,054 --> 01:05:02,146
Don't be tricked!

788
01:05:03,222 --> 01:05:04,211
Sit down!

789
01:05:06,392 --> 01:05:08,087
His mercy is false! Don't be
tricked by his devilish voice!

790
01:05:10,463 --> 01:05:12,658
Abracadabra! Freeze!

791
01:05:19,405 --> 01:05:20,497
l order the evil spirits to
be exercised!

792
01:05:34,053 --> 01:05:37,955
l am the absoulute Buddha.

793
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:40,920
What kind of evil spirit
are you!

794
01:05:41,427 --> 01:05:44,225
Even before Buddha you
refuse to reveal your true appearance!

795
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,126
The spirit of evil?!
l am what l look like!

796
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:49,561
l don't believe you are Buddha!

797
01:05:50,002 --> 01:05:51,094
Let's go over and see if
you're real or false.

798
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:52,329
Don't!

799
01:06:03,049 --> 01:06:06,541
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!

800
01:06:24,137 --> 01:06:24,933
Elder!

801
01:06:25,104 --> 01:06:26,298
The bastard Hu betrayed us.

802
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:28,305
l'll take care of things here.
Leave quickly!

803
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:32,136
Abracadabra! Hocus pocus!
The universe revolves.

804
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:40,484
May Buddha be in your heart.

805
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:42,881
l knew he was false,
but couldn't conquer him.

806
01:06:44,423 --> 01:06:45,617
l failed!

807
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:49,651
l can't perform my magic
with you here.

808
01:06:50,129 --> 01:06:52,120
l'll open a tunnel in the
earth for you. Hurry!

809
01:06:59,438 --> 01:07:00,427
Autumn!

810
01:07:00,573 --> 01:07:02,564
Hurry up!

811
01:07:03,142 --> 01:07:04,336
l can't hold out.

812
01:07:05,244 --> 01:07:06,336
Hurry!

813
01:07:06,646 --> 01:07:09,740
Abracadabra! Hurry!

814
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:19,883
Father!

815
01:07:31,671 --> 01:07:34,162
They've escaped for now but
l'll get them in the end.

816
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:36,064
Guard the three we've captured!

817
01:07:36,442 --> 01:07:37,534
Yes!

818
01:07:45,618 --> 01:07:46,915
What about Lord Fu?

819
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,117
They have admitted their errors.
They have departed.

820
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:51,682
People should acknowledge
the immensity of the universe.

821
01:07:51,958 --> 01:07:53,050
l just heard a fight going on.

822
01:07:53,693 --> 01:07:56,594
Your ears aren't clean!

823
01:07:56,762 --> 01:08:01,165
Vacate your mind to attain
perfect peace of mind.

824
01:08:58,724 --> 01:08:59,816
l'm very cold.

825
01:09:33,626 --> 01:09:36,322
Sian!

826
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:44,992
Don't leave me!

827
01:09:58,217 --> 01:09:59,514
Sian!

828
01:10:05,725 --> 01:10:06,919
Don't be reincarnated so soon.

829
01:10:08,661 --> 01:10:10,060
lt's too hard to be mortal now.

830
01:10:11,063 --> 01:10:12,462
You're so good to Sian.

831
01:10:13,566 --> 01:10:15,659
l never realized how much
you missed her!

832
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:18,769
l never realized how much
you missed her!

833
01:11:20,866 --> 01:11:22,959
Frost fills the sky over
10 Mile Lake.

834
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:25,960
Silken threads anxoius of youth.

835
01:11:28,107 --> 01:11:31,008
Looking at the moon and
feeling lonely.

836
01:11:31,377 --> 01:11:39,375
Envious of lovers, not of
immortality.

837
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:49,124
Sian!

838
01:11:56,936 --> 01:11:58,733
Sian, what are you doing here?

839
01:11:58,971 --> 01:12:00,962
Hide! You can't let the sun
shine on you!

840
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:02,639
lf the sun shines on you,
your soul will be scattered.

841
01:12:02,775 --> 01:12:04,970
You would never be reincarnated!

842
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:08,569
Why don't you listen to me? Sian!

843
01:12:14,386 --> 01:12:16,081
Oh, it's you! l'm sorry.

844
01:12:16,388 --> 01:12:17,787
Once again l've made a mistake.

845
01:12:19,658 --> 01:12:20,750
l mistook you for she.

846
01:12:25,598 --> 01:12:27,088
So there really is someone
named Sian!

847
01:12:27,933 --> 01:12:29,127
ls she the one in the painting?

848
01:12:30,336 --> 01:12:31,530
Do you miss her very much?

849
01:12:32,738 --> 01:12:34,535
She's already dead and buried.

850
01:12:35,274 --> 01:12:36,866
We'll never meet again.

851
01:12:40,546 --> 01:12:43,447
lf you want, you can
call me Sian for now.

852
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:45,075
For now?

853
01:12:49,154 --> 01:12:52,749
l understand.
You're betrothed to another.

854
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:55,959
When l knew Sian,

855
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:58,119
she was also betrothed to
somebody else.

856
01:12:58,964 --> 01:13:00,158
lt's beyond my control.

857
01:13:02,434 --> 01:13:04,629
Sian said exactly the same thing.

858
01:13:12,278 --> 01:13:14,769
You are morial; she's a ghost

859
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:17,278
But you're both exactly the same.

860
01:13:21,754 --> 01:13:23,051
Are we very much alike?

861
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:25,820
Too much so.

862
01:13:26,292 --> 01:13:27,884
You gave me false hope.

863
01:13:29,328 --> 01:13:31,319
Anyway, false hope is
better than none.

864
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:35,925
Excuse me!

865
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:40,866
Here's your tea.

866
01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:42,770
Your meal will be served presently.

867
01:13:43,242 --> 01:13:44,641
Please make yourselves at home.

868
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:51,312
l've seen that man before. He's...

869
01:13:52,084 --> 01:13:57,078
The tea is poisoned!
This inn is run by thieves!

870
01:13:57,222 --> 01:13:57,916
Really!

871
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:59,082
ls the water boiling?

872
01:13:59,491 --> 01:14:00,583
The blade sharpened?

873
01:14:00,759 --> 01:14:01,953
Everything's ready.

874
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:03,159
Put the man in the cauldron
immediately.

875
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,923
Save the woman for tonight,
to warm our cold beds.

876
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,193
Kill!

877
01:14:08,734 --> 01:14:10,429
Slice them up good!

878
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:16,974
Right on!

879
01:14:18,544 --> 01:14:21,138
Stop!

880
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:26,845
Watch where you're stabbing!

881
01:14:29,588 --> 01:14:31,385
They escaped through the window.

882
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:45,726
lt's dangerous here.
This is no way to escape!

883
01:14:49,408 --> 01:14:50,500
Better jump into the tree and hide.

884
01:14:52,411 --> 01:14:54,504
l still haven't recovered.
No energy to jump.

885
01:14:56,615 --> 01:14:58,412
Don't worry about me. Run!

886
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,450
No, l won't leave you.

887
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:04,945
This time there's no escape!

888
01:15:05,324 --> 01:15:06,916
l never thought we'd die here.

889
01:15:06,992 --> 01:15:08,983
Elder, it's our fault for
getting you involved.

890
01:15:10,529 --> 01:15:11,723
l'm not Elder Chu.

891
01:15:12,131 --> 01:15:13,928
l'm just a poor scholar.

892
01:15:15,134 --> 01:15:16,226
No matter who you are...

893
01:15:16,568 --> 01:15:18,763
l feel fortunate to die
with the one l love.

894
01:15:24,276 --> 01:15:25,470
We'll never be parted again.

895
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:34,350
We'll never be parted again.
Hold me!

896
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:41,682
Let me be on the outside so
that the wolf eats me first.

897
01:15:43,729 --> 01:15:44,718
You're wonderful.

898
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:49,098
So are you.

899
01:15:49,968 --> 01:15:51,265
lf we could be like this
forever, it would be great.

900
01:16:25,237 --> 01:16:28,729
Orchid Monastery!

901
01:16:28,941 --> 01:16:29,839
Orchid Monastery!

902
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,134
What's the Orchid Monastery?

903
01:16:35,981 --> 01:16:37,278
How could l have forgotten
about Yan?

904
01:16:37,483 --> 01:16:38,381
Who is he?

905
01:16:38,917 --> 01:16:40,817
The bearded man in the Orchid
Monastery. A wizard in the occult.

906
01:16:41,286 --> 01:16:43,186
lf we find him, we can deal
with the High Priest.

907
01:16:55,834 --> 01:16:57,324
lsn't the High Priest
returning to the capital city?

908
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:59,767
Why go to his palace?

909
01:17:00,572 --> 01:17:03,370
He needs a tranquil place
to meditate.

910
01:17:09,581 --> 01:17:12,072
Only holy people may enter
this sacred place. Stay where you are.

911
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:36,098
This is the hour of the eclipse.

912
01:17:40,445 --> 01:17:45,348
My body is changing against
my wish.

913
01:18:03,669 --> 01:18:05,762
Why are all the officials of
the imperial court here?

914
01:18:14,213 --> 01:18:17,614
Lord Chiang! Lord Yang! Lord Lee!

915
01:18:19,284 --> 01:18:21,878
l was escorting Lord Fu back
to the capital...

916
01:18:22,054 --> 01:18:24,045
But couldn't complete my
mission. Allow me to explain

917
01:18:27,526 --> 01:18:29,619
Lord Chiang!

918
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:33,320
A hollow shell?

919
01:18:33,832 --> 01:18:37,324
Lord Yang is a hollow shell, too?

920
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:39,963
What kind of a place is this?
Are you demons?

921
01:18:40,172 --> 01:18:42,470
What did you do with the
flesh and blood of these officials?

922
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,980
You demons, come out and
face me!

923
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:56,910
Why did you do with the flesh and
blood of these officials?

924
01:18:57,089 --> 01:18:57,987
What evil intentions do you
harbour?

925
01:19:00,492 --> 01:19:01,584
Are they all hollow shells?!

926
01:19:02,861 --> 01:19:05,659
l'm going to destroy all of
you evil monks.

927
01:19:13,505 --> 01:19:14,995
Strange, where have they hidden?

928
01:19:27,252 --> 01:19:30,551
Autumn? Moon? Lord Fu?

929
01:19:31,590 --> 01:19:33,581
Lord Fu!

930
01:19:36,128 --> 01:19:37,925
What happened?
Where are the others?

931
01:19:39,364 --> 01:19:41,264
l was wrong to believe you!
You've caused so much harm!

932
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:42,296
What other plots do you have
up your sleave?

933
01:19:42,401 --> 01:19:44,596
We were tricked.
The High Priest is a demon!

934
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:46,837
He turned many officials
into walking corpses.

935
01:19:47,606 --> 01:19:49,096
We must report this to the emperor.

936
01:19:49,308 --> 01:19:50,707
Otherwise, the kingdom will
be beyond redemption.

937
01:19:51,443 --> 01:19:52,740
Oh, he's the one who
instigated this calamity!

938
01:19:52,945 --> 01:19:54,242
No wonder the court is in
upheaval.

939
01:19:54,546 --> 01:19:55,945
We must hurry to rescue the others.
We can talk later.

940
01:20:00,652 --> 01:20:02,347
Moon!

941
01:20:09,661 --> 01:20:10,753
Autumn!

942
01:20:11,363 --> 01:20:14,560
There are demons in the court, so l must
get involved in affairs of state

943
01:20:14,733 --> 01:20:15,722
Everyone must do his bit.

944
01:20:17,402 --> 01:20:18,596
Hurry! There's danger everywhere.

945
01:20:18,737 --> 01:20:19,829
Let's get past this hurdle first.

946
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:22,629
These demonic monks have
great magical powers.

947
01:20:22,808 --> 01:20:24,400
Once he's awake we won't be
able to escape, so hurry!

948
01:20:26,378 --> 01:20:27,777
Autumn, get out of here!
Don't fight anymore!

949
01:20:30,015 --> 01:20:30,811
This is a scene of desolation.

950
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:32,213
Lord, ride my horse.

951
01:20:35,821 --> 01:20:36,719
More chanting!

952
01:20:36,855 --> 01:20:38,152
l'll use my powers to
help you concentrate.

953
01:20:40,258 --> 01:20:41,953
Come back, Hu.
You'll never beat him.

954
01:21:53,365 --> 01:21:56,061
Put down your butchers' knives.
Bow before Buddha!

955
01:21:59,871 --> 01:22:01,771
Hu, don't sacrifice yourself in vain!

956
01:22:03,408 --> 01:22:05,000
l mistakenly trusted these demons
and slaughtered righteous officials.

957
01:22:05,544 --> 01:22:07,637
To atone for my sins,
l'll fight him to the death.

958
01:22:10,082 --> 01:22:11,276
Don't!

959
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:13,541
l'm headed for hell anyway.

960
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:19,117
Hu!

961
01:22:22,594 --> 01:22:24,687
Yan, why does the wind
suddenly blow so violently?

962
01:22:25,163 --> 01:22:26,357
lt's hard to tell which
direction is which.

963
01:22:27,432 --> 01:22:28,729
Yan, what should we do?

964
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,094
Evil spirits pervade this road.
Our lives hang by a clender thread.

965
01:22:32,304 --> 01:22:33,601
We mustn't stop. Follow me!

966
01:22:43,415 --> 01:22:45,508
Oh, boundless heaven and earth!
Help me!

967
01:22:54,226 --> 01:22:58,526
Recite the scriptures with
me! Prajna paramita...

968
01:23:00,532 --> 01:23:03,831
Prajna paramita...

969
01:23:09,007 --> 01:23:10,099
The Diamond Sutra incantation?

970
01:23:11,376 --> 01:23:12,468
Prajna paramita...

971
01:23:16,848 --> 01:23:19,646
lgnoramus, behaving so
boorishly in front of me!

972
01:23:20,485 --> 01:23:21,782
Prajna paramite...

973
01:23:24,523 --> 01:23:26,320
Ning, Windy... get out of the way!

974
01:23:26,625 --> 01:23:28,115
Oh, boundless heaven and earth.
Help me!

975
01:23:34,799 --> 01:23:39,395
Buddha is present!

976
01:23:44,509 --> 01:23:46,704
lf you dare to impersonate Buddha,
what would you not dare to do?

977
01:23:47,145 --> 01:23:50,342
You think you can hoodwink
the people forever?

978
01:23:51,216 --> 01:23:54,014
l'm going to let everyone
know what you really are!

979
01:23:54,686 --> 01:23:57,086
The masses love to worship
their idols.

980
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:59,689
Why set yourself against the people?

981
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:03,590
lt's their ignorance that
has allowed you to succeed.

982
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:05,192
l'll never let them worship
demons like you.

983
01:24:05,463 --> 01:24:06,259
You'll never decieve the
people again!

984
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:10,232
lf you refuse to follow my
shining beacon...

985
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:12,364
you will be destroyed!

986
01:24:13,271 --> 01:24:17,571
What crap! Look out!

987
01:24:23,682 --> 01:24:25,274
Justine for all!

988
01:24:33,725 --> 01:24:34,817
Swords are part of the infinite!

989
01:24:41,733 --> 01:24:43,325
We've only destroyed the
false cuter body.

990
01:24:43,435 --> 01:24:44,333
He can come back &
attack us at any time.

991
01:24:44,436 --> 01:24:46,028
We must use our swords
to fight back!

992
01:24:46,338 --> 01:24:48,431
Let me introduce myself.
l'm from the Kunlun sect...

993
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,239
At a time like this,
let's not separate into sects.

994
01:24:50,408 --> 01:24:52,501
We're all fighting the same enemy.
Destroy this demon!

995
01:24:52,744 --> 01:24:53,642
Chant with me!

996
01:24:53,979 --> 01:24:56,971
Prajna paramita...

997
01:24:57,115 --> 01:25:03,213
Prajna paramita...

998
01:25:28,113 --> 01:25:29,910
The old demon has stolen into the earth
and broken through our ring of swords.

999
01:25:30,115 --> 01:25:31,605
What should we do?

1000
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:32,648
Watch!

1001
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,409
What kind of demon?

1002
01:25:36,588 --> 01:25:37,680
Come with me!

1003
01:25:44,329 --> 01:25:45,819
Hold on to me as l fly.

1004
01:25:48,366 --> 01:25:49,355
Ning!

1005
01:25:49,901 --> 01:25:51,095
You pulled my sleave off.

1006
01:25:57,509 --> 01:25:58,601
What are you coming back for

1007
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:02,035
What happened?

1008
01:26:02,947 --> 01:26:04,244
Gone?

1009
01:26:26,204 --> 01:26:27,193
Be careful!

1010
01:26:35,547 --> 01:26:37,538
Moon, look after your father
l'll help Yan.

1011
01:26:38,316 --> 01:26:39,613
Autumn, be careful!

1012
01:26:40,785 --> 01:26:41,774
The demon's actually a
giant centipede!

1013
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,616
That worm can never be a dragon.

1014
01:26:44,823 --> 01:26:45,721
Elder!

1015
01:26:54,799 --> 01:26:56,790
l've never had to deal with
such a giant creature.

1016
01:26:57,068 --> 01:26:57,966
What should we do now?

1017
01:26:58,036 --> 01:26:59,628
Pierce the crown of its head

1018
01:27:09,581 --> 01:27:10,479
Ning!

1019
01:27:20,925 --> 01:27:21,914
Windy!

1020
01:27:30,101 --> 01:27:31,898
The flying sword!

1021
01:28:11,743 --> 01:28:12,937
Prajna paramita!

1022
01:28:15,947 --> 01:28:17,039
Exercise the demons!

1023
01:28:21,386 --> 01:28:23,377
Oh, boundless heaven and
earth. Help me!

1024
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:33,126
Elder!

1025
01:28:33,298 --> 01:28:34,196
Autumn!

1026
01:28:36,034 --> 01:28:37,433
Two heads are better than one.

1027
01:28:37,602 --> 01:28:39,593
Abracadabra. Hocus pocus.

1028
01:28:47,312 --> 01:28:48,802
Hocus pocus.

1029
01:29:21,913 --> 01:29:23,710
l've been in the Orchid
Monastery for so long...

1030
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:26,840
l didn't know the world was
so full of devils and demons

1031
01:29:27,151 --> 01:29:28,448
lt's hard to separate the
living from the dead.

1032
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:30,517
The world is in chaos.

1033
01:29:31,322 --> 01:29:32,619
lt's a good thing you hid in
the Orchid Monastery.

1034
01:29:32,924 --> 01:29:34,824
Otherwise l might never
have found you.

1035
01:29:35,727 --> 01:29:36,819
We share the same ideals...

1036
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:39,052
We should roam this world together
and fight for justice.

1037
01:29:39,264 --> 01:29:40,253
We should work together.

1038
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:42,059
What are you saying?

1039
01:29:42,133 --> 01:29:43,828
l've always led a solitary existence.

1040
01:29:44,035 --> 01:29:46,936
Last time, l almost died
trying to help you save Sian

1041
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:49,005
This time, l've helped you
battle the demons...

1042
01:29:49,107 --> 01:29:49,903
and almost lost my life.

1043
01:29:49,974 --> 01:29:51,168
lt's better if we go our own ways.

1044
01:29:51,376 --> 01:29:53,674
When you need my help,
l'll return and save you.

1045
01:30:09,627 --> 01:30:11,026
Be careful, Autumn!

1046
01:30:30,548 --> 01:30:32,948
We're locked in. We must
think of a way to escape.

1047
01:30:33,685 --> 01:30:36,984
You're right! l've really
caused you harm.

1048
01:30:42,293 --> 01:30:45,194
Our bodies are restrained. We can be
saved only if our souls can escape.

1049
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:47,027
Souls?

1050
01:30:47,098 --> 01:30:50,397
Will we have enough energy
to later let the souls back in?

1051
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:52,735
This is the only way!

1052
01:30:52,804 --> 01:30:54,601
Chant along with me.

1053
01:30:58,476 --> 01:31:03,573
The spirit of Buddha conquers all!

1054
01:31:04,849 --> 01:31:11,846
Goodness is indestructible.

1055
01:31:19,897 --> 01:31:23,298
Oh, boundless heaven and earth.
Help me!

1056
01:31:24,936 --> 01:31:27,837
Help me!
Hocus pocus!

1057
01:31:54,465 --> 01:31:55,762
Autumn!

1058
01:32:00,471 --> 01:32:02,063
Yan!
Autumn!

1059
01:32:03,241 --> 01:32:04,333
Yan!

1060
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:05,936
Soul, return!

1061
01:32:11,949 --> 01:32:13,041
My soul can't return to my body!

1062
01:32:14,385 --> 01:32:15,977
Autumn, catch the soul!

1063
01:32:21,926 --> 01:32:24,326
His power isn't strong enough.
l'll help him.

1064
01:32:24,529 --> 01:32:26,019
Prajna paramita...

1065
01:32:27,765 --> 01:32:29,062
l can't catch it.

1066
01:32:29,867 --> 01:32:30,959
Moon!

1067
01:34:14,205 --> 01:34:15,194
What's all the hubub outside

1068
01:34:15,273 --> 01:34:16,570
What hubbub? l don't hear
anything!

1069
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,992
Who's getting married?
Such a large golden pig!

1070
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:41,023
lt's a gift to Lord Fu from
the emperor.

1071
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:44,667
Since he exposed the
traitors in the imperial

1072
01:34:45,036 --> 01:34:46,230
court, he performed a great
service for the emperor.

1073
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:48,861
lt's a wedding gift for Lord
Fu's daughter.

1074
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:54,009
Moon!

1075
01:34:54,946 --> 01:34:56,436
Moon!

1076
01:34:57,415 --> 01:34:58,712
Ning!

1077
01:35:05,256 --> 01:35:06,655
ls Windy getting...

1078
01:35:07,158 --> 01:35:08,352
Sister is already married.

1079
01:35:08,526 --> 01:35:10,016
Don't cause her any trouble.

1080
01:35:12,363 --> 01:35:13,352
l'm about to start on a journey.

1081
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:16,262
Give her my best wishes for
a happy marriage.

1082
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:22,161
l will. Take care of yourself.

1083
01:35:33,184 --> 01:35:34,276
Adieu!

1084
01:35:49,166 --> 01:35:51,259
lt's hard to differentiate
between true and false hopes

1085
01:35:51,802 --> 01:35:54,794
Now l understand why you
stay away from our mortal world.

1086
01:35:55,473 --> 01:35:58,567
Mortals are forgetful.
Good deeds fade like the wind.

1087
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:01,604
No matter what you've done,
it's soon forgotten.

1088
01:36:02,546 --> 01:36:04,446
ls forgetting good or bad?

1089
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:06,544
Should we have hopes?

1090
01:36:20,097 --> 01:36:21,587
You said you'd cherish no
hopes!

1091
01:36:22,566 --> 01:36:24,363
Sister, don't hesitate!
Go to him!

1092
01:36:32,576 --> 01:36:33,372
Windy?!

1093
01:36:33,477 --> 01:36:34,375
Ning!

1094
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:37,479
Let's go, hurry!

1095
01:36:38,983 --> 01:36:39,881
You go back.

1096
01:36:39,984 --> 01:36:42,282
Farewell!
Take care!

1097
01:36:43,587 --> 01:36:44,576
Let's go!

1098
01:36:51,629 --> 01:36:54,325
The path of life

1099
01:36:54,899 --> 01:36:58,391
Are dreams, like the length of the path

1100
01:36:59,203 --> 01:37:02,001
The storm on the way

1101
01:37:02,173 --> 01:37:06,075
Pass by as you go along

1102
01:37:07,044 --> 01:37:10,138
ln the world

1103
01:37:10,348 --> 01:37:13,840
How many ways can one dream?

1104
01:37:14,585 --> 01:37:19,181
Looking for dream-like love

1105
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:23,390
And the path goes on

1106
01:37:24,695 --> 01:37:27,596
Life is what

1107
01:37:27,865 --> 01:37:31,266
Dreams and desires are made of

1108
01:37:32,169 --> 01:37:34,967
Somewhere in the dream

1109
01:37:35,139 --> 01:37:39,542
There are traces of tears

1110
01:37:40,011 --> 01:37:43,208
Where to go to?

1111
01:37:43,381 --> 01:37:46,873
To find where my heart wants to go

1112
01:37:47,518 --> 01:37:52,217
The wind seems to sign in the dream,

1113
01:37:52,523 --> 01:37:56,516
and the path and l go on.

1114
01:38:01,265 --> 01:38:04,359
The path of living

1115
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:08,034
The happiness of youth

1116
01:38:09,006 --> 01:38:11,497
The path is full of difficulties

1117
01:38:11,976 --> 01:38:15,673
That no light can be seen

1118
01:38:16,781 --> 01:38:19,875
ln the dust,

1119
01:38:20,151 --> 01:38:23,746
how many ways can one find happiness

1120
01:38:24,355 --> 01:38:28,951
The wind and rain pass like a dream,

1121
01:38:29,427 --> 01:38:34,228
and the path goes on.
