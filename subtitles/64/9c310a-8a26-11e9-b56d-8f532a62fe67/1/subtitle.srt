1
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,848
<i>How the hell did I get up here?</i>

2
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:33,731
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

3
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,410
<i>Just four weeks ago,
I was a completely different person.</i>

4
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,338
<i>I had no adventure in my life.</i>

5
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:40,518
<i>I had a wife.</i>

6
00:02:40,622 --> 00:02:42,052
<i>I had a family.</i>

7
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:46,220
<i>And I never looked twice
when a pretty girl walked by.</i>

8
00:02:46,607 --> 00:02:47,687
<i>Never.</i>

9
00:04:12,573 --> 00:04:14,362
- Four, please.
- Me, too.

10
00:04:45,602 --> 00:04:48,123
<i>- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm looking... What's that?</i>

11
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:50,780
It's the air conditioner.
It'll come on in a second.

12
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,727
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

13
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:55,426
I beg your pardon!

14
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:57,215
I'm losing my briefcase.

15
00:05:07,046 --> 00:05:08,420
I don't know.

16
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,155
No, I've never tried it that way before.

17
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,295
No, I'm not worried.

18
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,215
It's just that I've never tried it
in that position before.

19
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:19,489
It's all new to me.

20
00:05:21,929 --> 00:05:24,351
Well, I know you have to wet it
before you put it in.

21
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:26,213
You have to, or it could break off.

22
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:29,541
How far? I don't know how far.

23
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,352
All the way, I suppose.

24
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:36,450
I know you have to keep wiggling it
to get all the hairs off it.

25
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:37,831
All right!

26
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,069
Put that phone down.

27
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,849
I can't talk to you now. I'll call you back later.

28
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,810
Do you have to talk like that at work?

29
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,462
Can't you save that filthy stuff
until you get home?

30
00:05:48,012 --> 00:05:49,703
That was my brother.

31
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:52,296
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

32
00:05:52,877 --> 00:05:55,845
He and I are trying to set up
a photo-processing lab at my place.

33
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,055
That way I can take stuff home. For example...

34
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,435
All right!

35
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,946
- Where's the figures on the cable-car campaign?
- It's on the third floor...

36
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:07,015
Get them for me right away!
We've wasted enough time on this.

37
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,297
Yes, sir.

38
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:46,097
I spent two months on that.

39
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:49,012
- I want you to roll down the map and show me.
- All right.

40
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,158
Okay.

41
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,200
Hello?

42
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,597
Will you have dinner with me tonight?

43
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:03,632
What?

44
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:08,369
<i>La Primavera, in North Beach.</i>

45
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,164
<i>Tonight.</i>

46
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,884
I know who you are.

47
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:15,927
9:00?

48
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,360
Why?

49
00:07:18,619 --> 00:07:19,994
Just because.

50
00:07:26,973 --> 00:07:29,461
I can't make it at...

51
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,703
...9:00.

52
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,780
Say, 9:10?

53
00:07:34,878 --> 00:07:35,806
<i>Yes.</i>

54
00:07:56,769 --> 00:07:58,624
Why are you speaking to me in German?

55
00:07:59,426 --> 00:08:00,408
Why?

56
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:05,208
I mean, the modeling agency told me
that you were from Germany.

57
00:08:05,315 --> 00:08:06,427
It's not me.

58
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,873
Well, I'd better check.

59
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,074
Where am I going?

60
00:08:53,739 --> 00:08:55,146
How do I look?

61
00:08:56,555 --> 00:08:58,661
The earrings are too much, aren't they?

62
00:08:58,764 --> 00:09:01,285
Here, you keep 'em for me, honey.

63
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,528
I'll do it. You keep your eyes on the road.

64
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,057
They were killing me, anyway.

65
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:07,107
Didi, what was I gonna ask you?

66
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,707
I wanted to ask you something.

67
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:12,134
Would you like to go to the movies tonight?

68
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:13,547
Tonight's study group.

69
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,749
What do you mean?

70
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:18,091
What's today? Today's Wednesday?

71
00:09:18,415 --> 00:09:20,325
I thought today was Thursday.

72
00:09:20,496 --> 00:09:22,406
What's the matter with me?

73
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,445
I'd like to go anyway, if it's all right with you.

74
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:27,309
I can't put up with those crazies tonight.

75
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:31,086
It's all arranged.
You're taking the girls to the movies.

76
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:35,242
I promised them you would.
Anyway, you deserve a night out.

77
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,157
So, what do you say?

78
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,561
- What do you mean? Of course. Sure.
- You're wonderful.

79
00:09:55,477 --> 00:09:56,622
Honey.

80
00:09:57,494 --> 00:09:58,771
See you tonight.

81
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:00,561
Thanks for the lift.

82
00:10:14,104 --> 00:10:15,959
You know, you're cute when you serve.

83
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:19,317
Go ahead, Teddy. What are you nervous about?
Serve the ball.

84
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,752
Now come on, calm down.
Let the man serve, Buddy.

85
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,429
You got nothing to worry about.
It's only set point. It's not like your life.

86
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,960
It's just your self-respect.

87
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,878
Give him that solid one. Give him the ace.
Teddy, come on!

88
00:10:29,979 --> 00:10:31,735
What is it? Am I talking too much?

89
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,618
We'll calm down. We'll take it easy.
Teddy wants to serve.

90
00:10:34,716 --> 00:10:35,861
Okay?

91
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,906
You can do it. Put it right in there.

92
00:10:38,908 --> 00:10:39,836
What a serve!

93
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:40,860
Switch!

94
00:10:40,956 --> 00:10:45,048
Okay, here we go now. You ready?
Get that racquet ready, I'm coming at you.

95
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,905
This baby is mine!

96
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,380
- You hit the net.
- Follow-through.

97
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:50,301
- You can't!
- On the follow-through!

98
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,268
- You still can't hit the net.
- I hit it on the follow-through.

99
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,125
I hit this ball first, then the net,
on the follow-through.

100
00:10:56,223 --> 00:10:58,874
It's our point. It's 6-2. You're in the shit house.

101
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:01,791
- Anybody ever tell you you're cute?
- You're cute, too.

102
00:11:02,368 --> 00:11:03,929
- How you doing?
- Okay.

103
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:05,920
What's the matter, he getting to you?

104
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,968
No.

105
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:09,920
- So, what's that matter?
- Nothing.

106
00:11:10,017 --> 00:11:10,945
Hey!

107
00:11:11,489 --> 00:11:12,700
Look at that!

108
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:16,031
Oh, my. That is serious Nautilus.

109
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,354
Miss!

110
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,675
Thank you.

111
00:11:24,132 --> 00:11:26,554
Those are fine-looking racquets
you got there, girls.

112
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,351
What are they, Heads?

113
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,786
Joe, there's a phone call for you.

114
00:11:34,885 --> 00:11:36,958
Do me a favor and take it for me, will you?

115
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:41,116
I met them on separate nights.
How could I know they're sisters?

116
00:11:41,223 --> 00:11:43,263
- You're in a lot of trouble, Joe.
- No way.

117
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:47,840
I got a date with the little one at 7:00
and the older one at 9:15. Plenty of time.

118
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,722
What about Theresa?

119
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,030
What about Theresa?

120
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:56,609
Doesn't she notice anything
when you go with someone for a while?

121
00:11:56,713 --> 00:12:00,707
Like you used to go with that girl before.
Doesn't she think anything's up?

122
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,218
Look.

123
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,535
Theresa's got the kids to worry about.
She's too busy to notice anything.

124
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:07,879
And they're great kids.

125
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,532
She's 38 years old,
she's a very happily married woman.

126
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:12,043
You see. She smiles all the time.

127
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,995
- Does she do it?
- Does she do what?

128
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,068
What do you mean, "Does she do what?"

129
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:20,461
- What do you mean, "Does she do what?"
- Does she does she do it, too?

130
00:12:20,557 --> 00:12:22,925
- Do what, too?
- Does she have affairs, too?

131
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:30,087
Teddy, you're my friend, and I love you.

132
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,459
You're a sweet, sensitive guy...

133
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:34,020
...but you're very naive.

134
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,720
To think that my Theresa...

135
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,409
...would fool around?
- I just asked a question.

136
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,993
Do you believe this man asking
whether my Theresa would fool around?

137
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:45,228
I find it hard to imagine
your wife sleeping with you.

138
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:49,356
Teddy.

139
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:51,277
What am I laughing at?

140
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,224
Are you sure?

141
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:57,393
All right, I'll let him know. Thank you.

142
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:01,198
- Are you staying for lunch, Doctor?
- No. Joe!

143
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,351
What else did the neighbor say?

144
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:17,644
Nothing. She was coming over
to return a warming tray...

145
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:20,020
...and she ran into the bunch
coming down the steps.

146
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:22,803
Theresa, the kids, and all the furniture.

147
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:25,742
There was a big van waiting for them.

148
00:13:28,376 --> 00:13:29,358
What a bitch.

149
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,603
Come on, she was our friend, too.

150
00:13:31,705 --> 00:13:33,298
Wonder if it was her furniture?

151
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:36,183
- Why do you have to talk about that?
- What should we do, cry?

152
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,282
I just want to know
if she had a right to take all the furniture.

153
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,801
Is it from Theresa?

154
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:47,574
Found a picture of me with another woman.

155
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:49,013
Naked?

156
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,866
In a night club.

157
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:56,760
This isn't happening.

158
00:14:03,646 --> 00:14:07,062
This isn't fucking happening!
It's not happening!

159
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:09,431
Son of a bitch!

160
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,535
Bitches, fucking whore!

161
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:21,625
<i>Teddy, what could we do to cheer up Joe?</i>

162
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:25,056
- Want to do the blind man with me tonight?
- I can't do that.

163
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:27,543
- You do the blind man with me?
- No, I get nervous.

164
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,795
Joe needs a good laugh.

165
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:31,200
We'll take him to the place
where they threw him out.

166
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:32,509
I get too nervous.

167
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:35,960
Came in with a cardigan.
They wanted him to put on one of their jackets.

168
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:38,880
- Okay, Michael? Come on.
- No, I get too nervous.

169
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,947
- Are you tied up with Mrs. Schumacher?
- I'm not tied up with her.

170
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:43,613
- His boss's wife.
- I don't believe it.

171
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,427
I'm telling you. You were away on vacation.
He's banging Dr. Schumacher's wife.

172
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,078
Son-of-a-gun!
Are you making it with Schumacher's wife?

173
00:14:50,182 --> 00:14:51,644
- Only at night.
- Lf it's an emergency.

174
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,343
- "Only at night?"
- Ask him.

175
00:14:53,446 --> 00:14:55,268
The time it takes me to drive there...

176
00:14:55,366 --> 00:14:58,628
...is the exact same time it takes him
to scrub and put on his gloves.

177
00:14:58,727 --> 00:15:02,754
If it's not a big job, it's not worth it to me.
If it's appendicitis, I don't go.

178
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,703
<i>But, if it's peritonitis or a gall bladder...</i>

179
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,445
"Hello, honey, good news.
It's a quadruple bypass!"

180
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,100
So, you say like this:

181
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,881
"Is Mr. Pierce there, please?" Very timid.

182
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:19,840
- "Is Mr. Pierce there, please?"
- That's it, just like that.

183
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:22,052
Then I'll get on the phone and say, "Hello?"

184
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:26,628
Then I'm going to wait a few seconds,
like I'm listening to you, and then I'll say:

185
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:28,258
"What?

186
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,595
"You want me to come out right now?

187
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,441
"Are you sure that you can't handle this
by yourself, Richard?"

188
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:37,413
- Who's Richard?
- Richard's my assistant.

189
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:39,369
He works here at the office with me.

190
00:15:40,142 --> 00:15:41,287
Clear?

191
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,103
Is it a woman?

192
00:15:46,031 --> 00:15:47,526
Is it a woman?

193
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,316
<i>No. It's...</i>

194
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:51,398
"Is it a woman?"

195
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,484
What goes on in your head?

196
00:15:53,904 --> 00:15:55,660
No, it's just...

197
00:15:55,825 --> 00:15:57,199
<i>...we're planning...</i>

198
00:15:58,897 --> 00:16:00,457
Well, it's too complicated.

199
00:16:00,561 --> 00:16:01,903
But don't tell Didi...

200
00:16:02,065 --> 00:16:03,975
...because it's a wonderful surprise.

201
00:16:04,081 --> 00:16:06,024
- You want me to call you at 8:15?
- 8:15.

202
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,821
It has to be at 8:15 sharp.

203
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,486
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, sweetie pie.

204
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,325
Did Mom tell you about tonight?

205
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:30,228
- No. Missy, I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry, Daddy, but...

206
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,431
...Shelly didn't get the tickets until 4:00.

207
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,932
I know you really wanted to go to the movie...

208
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:38,327
...but it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance,
and his uncle had some pull.

209
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:41,075
- What tickets are you talking about?
- David Bowie.

210
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:44,247
You mean, you can't go to the movie?

211
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,479
I'm sorry, Daddy. I feel so bad.

212
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,136
No. Don't be silly.

213
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:50,965
Are you really disappointed?

214
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:53,113
<i>Well...</i>

215
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:57,425
<i>No, I mean, I wanted to go, sure, but...</i>

216
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,432
So these things happen.

217
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:01,881
I understand that.

218
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,376
- You remember Shelly, don't you?
- Of course.

219
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:13,755
How are you?

220
00:17:15,581 --> 00:17:16,858
How are you?

221
00:17:17,565 --> 00:17:18,514
I'm fine.

222
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,838
I'm fine.

223
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:29,844
You're a Jewish boy, aren't you?

224
00:17:30,368 --> 00:17:32,310
My mother and father are Jewish.

225
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:36,055
I see.

226
00:17:38,785 --> 00:17:41,949
- You're taking my little girl to see David Boowie?
- Bowie.

227
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,741
Bowie.

228
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,147
You take care...

229
00:17:49,827 --> 00:17:51,256
...of my girl.

230
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,467
You take care of my girl.

231
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:04,191
Now, of course,
I'm sure you've heard about the alphabet diet.

232
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:06,212
Now, that takes 26 weeks.

233
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:10,723
<i>The first week,
you're allowed anything that begins with an "A."</i>

234
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:15,164
<i>And, then onto the second week,
you're allowed anything that begins with a "B."</i>

235
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:17,412
There's only one problem.

236
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,861
<i>You have to watch yourself carefully
because by the time you get to "P"...</i>

237
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,522
<i>...you might put on all the weight
you lost on "K."</i>

238
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:24,737
Excuse me.

239
00:18:24,841 --> 00:18:28,998
And then, when you get to "X,"
it's very difficult...

240
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:32,641
<i>...because you start making up
your own spelling, like "X- Benedict"...</i>

241
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:34,404
<i>..."X- tra helpings."</i>

242
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:36,896
So, I would not recommend that diet.

243
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,261
You go through my pockets now?

244
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:45,989
No.

245
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,842
Not yet. I owe Marty $10.

246
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:51,148
I think he likes you.

247
00:18:51,437 --> 00:18:52,867
You think everyone likes me.

248
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:54,664
- They do.
- Oh, well.

249
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,867
Can I get you anything
before I start my study group?

250
00:18:58,606 --> 00:19:00,014
Oh, God.

251
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:07,694
What honey? What's the matter?

252
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,858
Nothing. It's not even worth talking about.

253
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,040
What?

254
00:19:13,488 --> 00:19:17,712
I was leaving my office and the boss comes in
with this pile of stuff and two assistants...

255
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,177
<i>...says, "Clean this up for tomorrow morning."</i>

256
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:22,281
<i>"Clean this up." Now I'm a cleaning man.</i>

257
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:25,903
- Will it take long?
- Take long? No, not if I work all night.

258
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:29,299
I'm just so tired, that's all.
I just don't know if I can stay awake.

259
00:19:29,395 --> 00:19:30,737
I'm so tired.

260
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,941
Baby. Here.

261
00:19:33,748 --> 00:19:36,115
I gave half to Richard, but...

262
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,986
...he panics, he gets so nervous.
I don't know if he can handle it.

263
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:42,993
Baby. Can I fix you a drink?

264
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,943
You know...

265
00:19:45,078 --> 00:19:47,445
...I really think they're taking advantage of me.

266
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:51,437
- Want Campari and soda?
- Yeah, that would be nice.

267
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,647
Thanks.

268
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:57,042
<i>You just...</i>

269
00:19:57,847 --> 00:20:00,499
You gotta draw a line and say, "No more.

270
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,056
<i>"You can't go past this line."</i>

271
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:05,943
Who's staying for dinner?

272
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,150
Honey, why are you shaving?

273
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:49,910
Why am I shaving?

274
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:53,854
What the hell is the matter with me?

275
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:58,391
Did you want this tie out?

276
00:20:59,906 --> 00:21:00,833
No.

277
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,621
What do I want another tie for?

278
00:21:04,002 --> 00:21:05,791
Honey, you're overtired.

279
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,009
I think that you should take a little nap
before you eat.

280
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:20,284
Come here and sit close to me.

281
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:22,941
What's this?

282
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,374
What do you mean? This is Joe's little boy.

283
00:21:25,478 --> 00:21:27,966
I know it's Joe's little boy,
but what's he doing here?

284
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:30,493
S-M-l-L-E.

285
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,541
Where is his...

286
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:34,948
...M- O-M-M-Y?

287
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:38,464
She didn't tell me. It's just for one night.

288
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:41,765
- She didn't tell you?
- No, she didn't.

289
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,619
Don't frighten him.

290
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:49,567
What a cute little pee-pee.

291
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:52,130
You leave his little pee-pee alone.

292
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:55,017
His Daddy's little pee-pee started all this.

293
00:21:57,452 --> 00:21:59,940
One, two, three. Hit it.

294
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:15,434
- Hello, gentlemen. How are we tonight?
- Fine, how you feeling, Andy?

295
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,852
How am I feeling? What do you mean?
Why shouldn't I be feeling fine?

296
00:22:18,959 --> 00:22:21,861
No, this nice man
just wanted to know how you were.

297
00:22:21,968 --> 00:22:22,895
I'm fabulous!

298
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,326
I've never felt better in my life!

299
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,113
Well, great.

300
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:28,584
What'll you have?

301
00:22:28,689 --> 00:22:30,729
- What'll you have?
- Southern Comfort with ice.

302
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,946
Make that two.

303
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,424
Okay. You bet.

304
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:35,824
I'll be right back. I gotta lock my car.

305
00:22:36,498 --> 00:22:37,905
There you are.

306
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:39,879
Cigarette?

307
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:43,020
- What was that?
- Nothing, sir. Just setting up your drinks.

308
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:46,316
- What was that?
- Nothing.

309
00:22:47,187 --> 00:22:48,235
Jake!

310
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,435
- He said he'd be back in just...
- Jake!

311
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:54,289
He said he'd be back in a minute, Andy.

312
00:22:54,389 --> 00:22:57,389
<i>- How did you know any name?
- Well, your friend called you...</i>

313
00:22:57,494 --> 00:22:58,509
Jake!

314
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:12,941
Where are you?

315
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,353
What is this?

316
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:15,536
What are you doing?

317
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,014
What are you doing with me?

318
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:21,934
What is this?

319
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,721
What the hell is this thing?

320
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:27,861
What kind of a place is this?

321
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:29,274
Hey!

322
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:31,221
- I'm right here, Andy.
- Jake!

323
00:23:31,387 --> 00:23:32,434
I'm right here.

324
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:34,960
Don't ever leave me again, Jake.

325
00:23:37,724 --> 00:23:40,823
<i>I'm sorry, he can't, he's...</i>

326
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,100
Sorry.

327
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:03,639
<i>At the tone,
the time will be 8:09 and 50 seconds.</i>

328
00:24:11,522 --> 00:24:13,824
All right, time to go back to bed.

329
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,332
You don't want your mommy
to be angry with me, do you?

330
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:20,127
Come here.

331
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:24,737
I want my mommy.

332
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,072
When you wake up,
your mommy will be here to pick you up.

333
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,365
Night-night.

334
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,586
Is she on a date?

335
00:24:56,169 --> 00:24:59,169
I don't know.
She asked me to keep him for one night.

336
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,161
Well, what about the other kids?

337
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:02,534
I don't know.

338
00:25:02,954 --> 00:25:04,864
Well, what am I supposed to say to Joe?

339
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:09,220
Nothing!
Don't you tell that son of a bitch anything!

340
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:11,779
Come on now. He's our friend.

341
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:13,378
He's a rat.

342
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:16,644
I would have left him long before she did.

343
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:19,592
What is that supposed to mean?

344
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,530
If anything like that ever happened to us...

345
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:25,613
...I don't know what I would do.

346
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:30,156
- We better just drop the subject.
- No. Now, wait a minute.

347
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,492
Now we're talking nicely and calmly.

348
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,860
Let's hear what you have to say on the subject.

349
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,040
<i>Teddy...</i>

350
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:40,392
I know you think you know everything about me,
but you don't.

351
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:43,755
I'm really a very jealous woman.

352
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:48,717
I know you think, emotionally, I'm like this, but...

353
00:25:48,817 --> 00:25:50,312
...you know, I really...

354
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,363
...am a little...

355
00:25:52,498 --> 00:25:53,839
...crazy.

356
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,441
But just in some ways.

357
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,235
- Why are you telling me all this?
- You asked me.

358
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,985
I know I asked you,
but you make it sound as if we're not a happily...

359
00:26:08,757 --> 00:26:09,706
What?

360
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:11,348
What have you got there?

361
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:12,682
It's a gun.

362
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:15,310
I know it's a gun,
but when did you ever get a gun?

363
00:26:15,414 --> 00:26:17,716
Well, Mama gave it to me after they moved.

364
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,182
You realize you might have shot me?

365
00:26:24,471 --> 00:26:26,032
I would never do that.

366
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:28,023
I mean, not without a reason.

367
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:29,711
You're not like Joe.

368
00:26:29,816 --> 00:26:32,981
Do you know what he did to Theresa,
right in front of me?

369
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,531
He had his secretary call at 10:00 at night...

370
00:26:36,633 --> 00:26:39,284
...and say he had work to do at the office.

371
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,376
- He did that?
- Yes.

372
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:46,962
You mean, that old trick still works?

373
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:49,811
Not anymore.

374
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,176
I'll get it.

375
00:26:55,388 --> 00:26:56,337
Hello?

376
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:59,770
Yes, just a minute. It's Richard.

377
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:05,399
Hello.

378
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,014
Yes, Richard. How are you?

379
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,085
Yes.

380
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:17,274
You what?

381
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,678
Is this a joke?

382
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:26,140
You want me to do what?

383
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:28,314
Are you crazy?

384
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:30,201
<i>They said...</i>

385
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:34,073
<i>They said I should do...</i>

386
00:27:35,234 --> 00:27:37,177
I should do what?

387
00:27:37,827 --> 00:27:40,642
They want me to come out at 10:00 at night...

388
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:42,975
...and leave my wife and children?

389
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:47,042
I don't care!
8:15, 10:00, what difference does it make?

390
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,897
I'm not a wind-up toy.

391
00:27:48,997 --> 00:27:52,958
You tell my superiors at the office,
who can give me raises and promotions...

392
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:57,732
...that if they don't like my answer,
they can go take it and shove it up their ass.

393
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:03,295
That's the best joke I've heard all year.

394
00:28:04,712 --> 00:28:05,694
Hey!

395
00:28:06,376 --> 00:28:08,165
Now what's going on?

396
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:11,621
Hey, fellas, come on now.

397
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,623
Let's just shake hands, we'll go home.

398
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:17,031
What the hell did you hit him for,
for Christ's sake?

399
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:20,425
What kind of a fellow are you,
pushes a blind man?

400
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:07,146
Hello?

401
00:29:11,827 --> 00:29:13,834
Okay. I'll be right over, sweetheart.

402
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,778
Are you sure it's a gallbladder?

403
00:31:31,274 --> 00:31:33,860
You better hurry.
They moved the meeting up 15 minutes.

404
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:36,166
Why doesn't anybody ever tell me these things?

405
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,958
It's like an oven over there.

406
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:14,030
Air conditioning must be on the blink again.

407
00:32:14,737 --> 00:32:16,046
What's that?

408
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:19,305
She's the girl they chose for
the cable-car campaign.

409
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:20,686
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

410
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,112
- Who is she?
- Ask the boss. He found her.

411
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:27,178
He goes riding once a week in Golden Gate Park.

412
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:29,550
Guess what he saw galloping through the fog?

413
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:31,178
Horseback riding?

414
00:32:43,126 --> 00:32:44,108
Ridden much?

415
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,937
Yes, since I was a little boy.

416
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,656
I used to teach horseback riding
to earn extra money.

417
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,248
- See you later.
- See you later.

418
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,089
Okay! Here we go!

419
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:56,631
Come on.

420
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,264
Everything okay?

421
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:08,272
Yes. I have a pebble...

422
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:10,328
...in my finger, in the glove.

423
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,077
Better to get it out now than when you're...

424
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,672
...tearing along like that, you know.

425
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,360
Okay! Come on, big fella.

426
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:21,233
Hi-ho, Thunder!

427
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,268
Away!

428
00:33:24,892 --> 00:33:25,972
Everything's okay?

429
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:28,794
<i>Yeah, I was just wondering
whether I should call my wife...</i>

430
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:32,919
Hey!

431
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:35,160
The ride to the left is the prettiest!

432
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:39,418
Yes, I just want to take a look
over here for a second!

433
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,525
<i>I searched all day long...</i>

434
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:49,144
<i>...but I couldn't find that woman
who was haunting me.</i>

435
00:33:52,065 --> 00:33:52,993
<i>Hello?</i>

436
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,696
How would you like to smoke the peace pipe?

437
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,100
<i>Who is this?</i>

438
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:01,144
You don't know me?

439
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:04,769
I had dinner alone at La Primavera.

440
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:07,485
It's you.

441
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,482
I'm so sorry I wasn't there the other night.

442
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,107
Please, forgive me.

443
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:15,706
My mother had a heart attack.

444
00:34:15,813 --> 00:34:18,399
I had to spend the night with her in the hospital.

445
00:34:20,005 --> 00:34:21,631
- How is she?
- Better.

446
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:25,411
She's trotting around.
I mean, she's walking around nicely now, but...

447
00:34:26,118 --> 00:34:27,810
...it was a terribly close call.

448
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:30,434
Do you know Le Club...

449
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:33,088
...at the corner of Jones Street and Clay?

450
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,653
Yes.

451
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:39,495
5:00.

452
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,529
Hi-ho, pal.

453
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:05,538
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

454
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:09,993
- Thanks. Catch you later.
- Sure.

455
00:35:48,915 --> 00:35:49,864
Heart.

456
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:53,839
Family heart!

457
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,352
Help!

458
00:36:22,521 --> 00:36:24,082
Somebody help!

459
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:46,109
Hello!

460
00:37:47,879 --> 00:37:48,894
Wait!

461
00:37:57,929 --> 00:37:58,877
Don't move!

462
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:04,352
Move!

463
00:38:05,578 --> 00:38:06,527
Go!

464
00:38:13,707 --> 00:38:14,787
Hello!

465
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:15,874
Wait!

466
00:38:16,236 --> 00:38:17,545
Hello, there!

467
00:38:22,189 --> 00:38:24,011
Easy, big fella. Easy!

468
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,725
Steady, Thunder!

469
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:33,933
Steady, boy! Take it easy.
Everything's under control.

470
00:38:34,127 --> 00:38:36,015
You're in no danger whatsoever.

471
00:38:36,111 --> 00:38:37,322
Easy does it.

472
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:38,536
Don't be nervous.

473
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:39,720
Hello, there.

474
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,640
Hello.

475
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,815
That's a gorgeous animal you have there.

476
00:38:44,368 --> 00:38:45,830
I'm somewhat of an expert.

477
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,920
That's a superb specimen.

478
00:38:48,145 --> 00:38:51,561
- She's a beauty.
- Yes, he is nice. Thank you.

479
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:52,614
Wait!

480
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,145
Move!

481
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,138
Go!

482
00:38:57,235 --> 00:38:59,690
Right, Thunder! To the right, Thunder.

483
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,169
To the right!

484
00:39:07,316 --> 00:39:08,691
Hello again.

485
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,635
Mind if I ride along with you for a while?

486
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:13,134
No. I don't mind.

487
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,928
Fancy meeting you here.

488
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:17,042
Do you ride very often?

489
00:39:17,142 --> 00:39:19,444
Yes, since I was a boy.

490
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:23,020
I used to teach riding
in order to earn a little extra money.

491
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:24,403
- Really?
- Yes.

492
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:29,140
By the way, about the other night.

493
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,247
I wanted to explain.

494
00:39:31,353 --> 00:39:32,880
What other night?

495
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,282
I see.

496
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:36,313
Excuse me!

497
00:39:36,409 --> 00:39:40,152
All right, you want to play it that way,
it's all right with me. I don't mind.

498
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,928
My riding crop.

499
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:45,270
That's all right. I'll get it.

500
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,996
Say, "I'm sorry," Thunder.

501
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,756
<i>Say, "I am sorry."</i>

502
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:50,681
Thunder is a sweet horse...

503
00:39:50,939 --> 00:39:52,696
...but, boy, is he dumb!

504
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:58,549
I hate to be too hard on him.

505
00:39:58,877 --> 00:40:00,568
It could kill his spirit, but...

506
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:02,263
<i>...boy, is he...</i>

507
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,364
You're a silly horse!

508
00:40:05,758 --> 00:40:07,384
He's just a baby, you know.

509
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,754
Here you are.

510
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,987
Thank you.

511
00:40:13,983 --> 00:40:15,642
You're very gallant.

512
00:40:16,543 --> 00:40:17,754
I'm just...

513
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:19,967
...a romantic, I guess.

514
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:25,337
Be good this time.

515
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:26,650
Be good.

516
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:28,448
Don't embarrass me.

517
00:40:28,994 --> 00:40:31,514
Wait. Whoa, Thunder!

518
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,463
Wait! You dropped something.

519
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:53,789
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

520
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:00,389
- Good night, Ted.
- Good night, Sharon.

521
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,585
- Have a nice night, Mr. Pierce.
- Thank you. Same to you, Richard.

522
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,089
Why, hello!

523
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,047
Hello, yourself.

524
00:41:56,144 --> 00:41:58,031
What a pleasant surprise.

525
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:01,545
Well, not really.
I just came to give you back your earring.

526
00:42:02,193 --> 00:42:04,332
- What earring?
- I don't know whose it is.

527
00:42:04,433 --> 00:42:07,881
It fell out of your pocket yesterday
when you got off your horse.

528
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:10,888
I decided to pick it up after you left so quickly.

529
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:14,511
Well, it's a nice earring, but it's not mine.

530
00:42:14,611 --> 00:42:16,619
What would I be doing with an earring?

531
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:18,192
So what's new?

532
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:20,234
I'm gonna be late for my dance class.

533
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:21,481
No, wait!

534
00:42:22,356 --> 00:42:24,397
How about having dinner with me?

535
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:27,884
Thank you, but no.

536
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:30,988
I know of this funny little place.

537
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:35,117
It's a fun little Chinese place,
where you sit down on the floor...

538
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:39,533
...and you can eat with your hands or chopsticks
or anything you want.

539
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:41,172
For lunch?

540
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:43,351
No, I'm not free for lunch or dinner.

541
00:42:44,503 --> 00:42:46,194
A little snack in-between?

542
00:42:47,384 --> 00:42:49,042
I'd better be going.

543
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:15,675
- What's your name?
- Theodore Pierce. Teddy. Ted.

544
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:22,164
Tomorrow, 6:00, Tulio's.

545
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,598
- On Columbus?
- Yeah.

546
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:28,540
How old is that suit?

547
00:43:29,247 --> 00:43:30,938
This? I don't know.

548
00:43:31,296 --> 00:43:33,752
Six, seven, eight years, maybe.

549
00:43:33,856 --> 00:43:35,198
It looks it.

550
00:43:37,728 --> 00:43:39,671
Wait! What's your name?

551
00:43:39,905 --> 00:43:41,149
Charlotte!

552
00:43:53,828 --> 00:43:55,519
Even longer on the pants.

553
00:43:55,715 --> 00:43:58,017
Longer on the pants?

554
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,093
More sleeve.

555
00:44:00,228 --> 00:44:01,854
You want more sleeve than this?

556
00:44:02,021 --> 00:44:03,777
Listen to me! This is what I know!

557
00:44:03,877 --> 00:44:05,950
But, Buddy, are you sure this style suits me?

558
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:09,469
- You want to look good at funerals?
- No, I just want to look nice.

559
00:44:09,574 --> 00:44:10,850
Let me see.

560
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:20,605
Put your arms down.

561
00:44:20,712 --> 00:44:22,884
Now you're cooking with Crisco!

562
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:31,358
Robert Redford.

563
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,573
Mr. Dengilihan! Great news!

564
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:41,865
I just got the figures from Community Affairs.
The cable-car campaign's a smash!

565
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:45,030
All the TV stations, Channel 5, Channel 3...

566
00:44:45,131 --> 00:44:46,986
...the newspapers, the magazines...

567
00:44:47,116 --> 00:44:50,412
...all they're talking about is
the reopening of the cable cars.

568
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:52,680
It's unbelievable. You wouldn't believe it.

569
00:44:53,133 --> 00:44:55,402
It's better than our wildest imagination.

570
00:44:55,501 --> 00:44:59,331
We couldn't have hoped for a better campaign
than what we've got right now.

571
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:00,616
It's due to you, sir.

572
00:45:00,718 --> 00:45:03,915
It's a wonderful tribute to the whole concept.

573
00:45:18,865 --> 00:45:21,070
Hey. What it is?

574
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,804
I'd like to make a reservation for tonight, please.
A double room.

575
00:45:31,219 --> 00:45:34,067
Something with a king-size bed, if you have it.

576
00:45:34,324 --> 00:45:35,731
<i>Let me have a look.</i>

577
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,348
<i>We have that available.
Can I have your name, please?</i>

578
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:39,597
Irving.

579
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:41,359
Julius...

580
00:45:41,813 --> 00:45:42,926
...lrving.

581
00:45:43,029 --> 00:45:45,419
<i>All right. Could you spell that for me, please?</i>

582
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,038
<i>L-r-v-i...</i>

583
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,046
No, wait a minute!

584
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,099
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

585
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:55,378
E-r-v-i...

586
00:45:55,768 --> 00:45:56,913
...n- g.

587
00:46:00,856 --> 00:46:04,304
Is there a Theodore Pierce here? Mr. Pierce?

588
00:46:04,569 --> 00:46:06,479
Sorry, nobody here by that name.

589
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:08,435
Well, nobody's answering.

590
00:46:09,722 --> 00:46:10,671
All right.

591
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:12,434
Now wait.

592
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:14,228
Miss Charlotte who?

593
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:16,599
Wait! Hello! Don't hang up, please.

594
00:46:16,698 --> 00:46:18,586
That's for me. Thank you.

595
00:46:19,483 --> 00:46:21,817
Hello, Charlotte? It's Teddy. Where are you?

596
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,442
<i>I'm in Los Angeles.</i>

597
00:46:23,964 --> 00:46:26,136
In Los Angeles? What are you doing there?

598
00:46:26,236 --> 00:46:27,578
<i>I'm sorry, I'm working.</i>

599
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:30,262
<i>I tried to phone you at work,
but you were in a meeting...</i>

600
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:32,089
<i>...and you couldn't be interrupted.</i>

601
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,138
No.

602
00:46:33,918 --> 00:46:35,740
<i>So, listen, why don't you fly down?</i>

603
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,115
To Los Angeles?

604
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:41,245
<i>The last flight gets here at 10:00 p.m.
I can meet you at the airport.</i>

605
00:46:42,847 --> 00:46:44,091
But I can't just...

606
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:46,296
<i>Listen, we'll spend the evening together...</i>

607
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,913
<i>...and we'll be back in San Francisco
by 10:00 tomorrow morning.</i>

608
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,760
<i>Hello?</i>

609
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:55,360
<i>Teddy, hello?</i>

610
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:46,339
- Honey. What's all this, cutie?
- A celebration.

611
00:47:46,442 --> 00:47:48,068
- For what?
- Just for fun.

612
00:47:48,169 --> 00:47:51,847
I'm too tired to go out, so I wanted
to have a party, just you, the kids and me.

613
00:47:51,947 --> 00:47:53,059
What do you think?

614
00:48:17,134 --> 00:48:20,004
- Shall we have a drink?
- That would be nice.

615
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:26,028
But take the phone off the hook.

616
00:48:28,144 --> 00:48:30,151
Would you like to make love?

617
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:31,527
Now?

618
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:36,618
Take the phone off the hook.

619
00:48:43,762 --> 00:48:44,843
Who's that?

620
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:46,289
I don't know yet.

621
00:48:49,523 --> 00:48:51,596
Telegram for Theodore Pierce.

622
00:49:01,078 --> 00:49:02,802
It's a telegram!

623
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:05,936
- A telegram? Who for?
- For you.

624
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,184
For me?

625
00:49:07,735 --> 00:49:08,913
Who from?

626
00:49:11,063 --> 00:49:14,839
- It's from the office.
- All right. Stop the kidding, now.

627
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:16,471
No, it's not a joke.

628
00:49:16,568 --> 00:49:20,529
"You must attend the transport symposium
in San Diego. Stop.

629
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:22,520
"Big press coverage. Stop.

630
00:49:22,617 --> 00:49:25,203

00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:28,918
<i>"Return San Francisco tomorrow. Stop.

632
00:49:38,172 --> 00:49:39,154
No.

633
00:49:40,028 --> 00:49:41,239
- No?
- No.

634
00:49:44,508 --> 00:49:45,785
I'm not going.

635
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:47,674
- Teddy!
- I'm not going.

636
00:49:47,837 --> 00:49:48,982
No.

637
00:49:53,535 --> 00:49:54,712
I am not going.

638
00:49:54,814 --> 00:49:56,189
Well, how can you say no?

639
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,735
Easy. No. You see that?
That's not so difficult, is it?

640
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:03,702
I'm not going! I don't care if they fire me!
I'm not leaving my wife and kids!

641
00:50:03,808 --> 00:50:05,368
Don't act like a child!

642
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:06,879
Teddy! Stop.

643
00:50:11,905 --> 00:50:14,294
Wait a minute! Hold the plane!

644
00:50:15,906 --> 00:50:17,248
Wait for me!

645
00:50:17,346 --> 00:50:19,004
Hold it! Wait!

646
00:50:26,116 --> 00:50:29,247
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we are beginning our descent into Los Angeles.</i>

647
00:50:29,348 --> 00:50:33,146
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,
extinguish all smoking materials...</i>

648
00:50:33,253 --> 00:50:35,358
Finished with your drink, sir?

649
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,298
- What's your name?
- Polly.

650
00:50:38,406 --> 00:50:39,333
Polly?

651
00:50:39,654 --> 00:50:41,956
- That's a lovely name.
- Thank you.

652
00:50:42,566 --> 00:50:44,737
- Thanks very much, Polly.
- Sure.

653
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:51,491
Sure, you make the announcement.

654
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:56,705
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

655
00:50:56,809 --> 00:51:01,567
<i>The captain has just informed me that
L.A. Airport is closed due to heavy fog.</i>

656
00:51:02,506 --> 00:51:07,143
<i>We will be landing in San Diego. You'll receive
further instruction once we're on the ground.</i>

657
00:51:11,307 --> 00:51:12,420
Thanks a lot.

658
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,645
Hello?

659
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:34,789
Hi, honey.

660
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:38,667
I was running from outside.
I heard the phone ringing.

661
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:41,103
No, it's okay.

662
00:51:41,328 --> 00:51:42,506
Go ahead.

663
00:51:45,105 --> 00:51:47,309
I took Shelly and the girls to a movie.

664
00:51:50,193 --> 00:51:51,622
Well, don't worry about me.

665
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,854
I have to study, anyway.
Shelly, please get out of my bedroom.

666
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:57,383
Are you afraid?

667
00:52:01,235 --> 00:52:02,250
What?

668
00:52:03,635 --> 00:52:06,571
Teddy, why are you giving me all these details?

669
00:52:07,284 --> 00:52:09,838
- I am going to scream.
- So will I.

670
00:52:10,196 --> 00:52:12,782
Of course you're in San Diego.
Where else would you be?

671
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:15,885
- I am going to tell your mother.
- She already knows.

672
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:18,092
What?

673
00:52:18,742 --> 00:52:20,847
- You're crazy.
- I want to marry you.

674
00:52:24,055 --> 00:52:27,219
Yes, there's plenty of food.
Don't worry about me.

675
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,432
Shelly!

676
00:52:28,664 --> 00:52:30,387
Of course I miss you.

677
00:52:31,032 --> 00:52:32,210
Me, too.

678
00:52:32,632 --> 00:52:34,094
I love you.

679
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:36,082
Me, too.

680
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:39,896
I love you. Bye-bye.

681
00:52:43,098 --> 00:52:45,684
Are you going to finish the game or not?

682
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:48,371
You got any Hershey bars?

683
00:52:56,252 --> 00:52:59,100
<i>While Didi was waiting for me
in San Francisco...</i>

684
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:02,103
<i>...Charlotte was waiting in Los Angeles.</i>

685
00:53:02,781 --> 00:53:05,913
<i>Two women waiting for me
in the middle of the night.</i>

686
00:53:07,102 --> 00:53:09,077
<i>Crazy as it seems...</i>

687
00:53:09,374 --> 00:53:11,578
<i>...I had adventure in my life.</i>

688
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:27,767
<i>Surprise of surprises.</i>

689
00:53:27,873 --> 00:53:30,721
<i>Next day, Joe's wife came back with the kids...</i>

690
00:53:31,138 --> 00:53:32,480
<i>...and the furniture.</i>

691
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:40,472
<i>Why she suddenly forgave him, nobody knew.</i>

692
00:53:49,892 --> 00:53:50,940
Eric?

693
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:53,443
Is there an Eric?

694
00:53:56,742 --> 00:53:57,920
Come on.

695
00:54:09,576 --> 00:54:12,511
<i>The next couple of days were full of surprises.</i>

696
00:54:13,161 --> 00:54:14,437
Hello, Ted.

697
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,690
<i>I just wanted to say,
"Good morning, and have a lovely day."</i>

698
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:30,978
Hello?

699
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,742
<i>Hello, how are you?</i>

700
00:54:46,926 --> 00:54:50,156
<i>The best surprise of all
was a phone call from Charlotte.</i>

701
00:54:50,382 --> 00:54:52,008
<i>I thought I wouldn't see her again...</i>

702
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:55,756
<i>...but she called to find out
I got back all right from San Diego.</i>

703
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:02,511
<i>During our 35-minute stroll,
I realized I was still in a deep fog.</i>

704
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,666
Here you go.

705
00:55:06,769 --> 00:55:10,032
<i>The only unpleasant surprise
was that in two days...</i>

706
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:11,665
<i>...Joe was back in form.</i>

707
00:55:11,762 --> 00:55:12,744
He's scared.

708
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,738
At 2:00 in the morning, he could fool me.

709
00:55:14,835 --> 00:55:17,770
What's the problem?
You go over, you get into bed, you say:

710
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:21,967
<i>"Dr. Schumacher, I've got a chill coming on.
I thought I'd better get under the covers."</i>

711
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:24,532
You guys want to play some checkers?

712
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:26,030
Miss!

713
00:55:26,229 --> 00:55:29,099
- You know where I can buy some checkers?
- That's embarrassing.

714
00:55:29,205 --> 00:55:32,205
I'm in the mood to play a little game
if you have some time.

715
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:35,212
- I'm very good, really.
- Yeah, right.

716
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:40,080
She wasn't wearing a bra. Did you see that?
Did you see the way they bounce?

717
00:55:40,183 --> 00:55:42,867
You'd kill for that, Teddy. You'd kill for that.

718
00:55:43,063 --> 00:55:45,617
- I didn't notice she wasn't wearing a bra.
- You're weird.

719
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:47,411
- I looked at her, though!
- You're weird.

720
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:48,919
He's a weird guy, isn't he?

721
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:53,108
- Did you notice that she didn't have a bra?
- What do I know, 'cause I see it every day?

722
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,645
You poor bitch.

723
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:07,770
It's open.

724
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:09,957
- How you doing?
- Good.

725
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:17,664
I thought you'd painted this place.

726
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:21,187
I was going to, before I moved in with my friend.

727
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:28,129
Well, you've got a nice chair.

728
00:57:28,393 --> 00:57:29,571
Thanks.

729
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:32,903
- What color you gonna paint?
- Shocking pink!

730
00:57:45,708 --> 00:57:48,708
This man walks into a doctor's office,
he says, "Doctor...

731
00:57:49,164 --> 00:57:52,231
<i>"...I have a terrible problem.
I can't remember anything."</i>

732
00:57:52,364 --> 00:57:53,477
And...

733
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:55,017
...the doctor says...

734
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,867
...I mean, the man says:

735
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,567
<i>"I can't think of...</i>

736
00:57:59,118 --> 00:58:01,322
"I don't even remember words.

737
00:58:01,422 --> 00:58:02,884
"I can't retain a word.

738
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:05,358
<i>"There's nothing that I say that I can remember."</i>

739
00:58:05,455 --> 00:58:06,982
And the doctor says:

740
00:58:07,087 --> 00:58:08,942
"How long have you had this problem?"

741
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,927
And the man says, "What problem?"

742
00:58:19,217 --> 00:58:20,744
That's your best joke?

743
00:58:23,506 --> 00:58:25,132
You'll be all right.

744
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:27,180
It just takes time.

745
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:38,258
You want to see something? Look at this thing.

746
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:39,665
I feel silly.

747
00:58:39,797 --> 00:58:41,870
- What if I had a date?
- You won't have a date.

748
00:58:41,973 --> 00:58:44,526
- I said, "What if I have a date?"
- You won't have one!

749
00:58:44,629 --> 00:58:47,280
I know I said that. I said, "What if I had a date?"

750
00:58:47,382 --> 00:58:50,033
If you have a date, I'll be your chauffeur!

751
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:51,697
All right.

752
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:55,638
- The joke is over.
- A bet's a bet.

753
00:58:56,632 --> 00:58:58,420
What was this bet?

754
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,601
I told him if I couldn't get him
his new car by tonight, I'd be his chauffeur.

755
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:07,734
- So, where are we going?
- We're going to Mama Dell's.

756
00:59:08,058 --> 00:59:10,709
You're going on your first date
to your grandmother's?

757
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:12,817
No, you silly!

758
00:59:13,113 --> 00:59:16,594
We made this date and I remembered
it was Mama Dell's birthday...

759
00:59:16,699 --> 00:59:21,075
...so I called her and I found out
she's gonna be all alone on her 85th birthday.

760
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:24,344
We'll drop by for five minutes,
just to have a glass of champagne.

761
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:27,543
But I'd feel terrible,
because I know it would mean so much to her.

762
00:59:27,644 --> 00:59:30,198
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

763
00:59:31,261 --> 00:59:33,944
<i>You don't feel concerned at all that...</i>

764
00:59:35,965 --> 00:59:39,097
- What?
- Well, no, I'm just saying, you know.

765
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,920
<i>You know where...</i>

766
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:43,196
Didi?

767
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,399
Didi and Mama Dell
don't even talk to each other.

768
00:59:46,656 --> 00:59:47,703
Okay.

769
00:59:49,951 --> 00:59:51,293
Who's Didi?

770
00:59:57,057 --> 00:59:58,367
Who's Didi?

771
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:03,839
<i>Didi...</i>

772
01:00:08,291 --> 01:00:09,568
<i>Didi is...</i>

773
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:17,981
Didi is Teddy's other grandmother!

774
01:00:19,461 --> 01:00:20,443
Funny woman.

775
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:22,938
Can't mention her name, but it makes you laugh.

776
01:00:23,046 --> 01:00:24,540
What a kidder!

777
01:00:25,062 --> 01:00:26,306
That Didi.

778
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:34,370
Will you do me a favor,
and come up for three minutes?

779
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:35,399
She loves you.

780
01:00:35,495 --> 01:00:37,121
Two minutes. We'll have champagne...

781
01:00:37,224 --> 01:00:40,836
Okay, I'll just come up to say hello
and give her a kiss. But I can't stay.

782
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:44,166
- All right, I'll see you in two minutes.
- Driver, you can't park here.

783
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:46,600
Don't give me a hard time.
I'll be a couple minutes.

784
01:00:46,698 --> 01:00:50,560
I'm not giving you a hard time.
You either move the car, or I call the police.

785
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:51,974
Go ahead up. I'll be right up.

786
01:00:52,074 --> 01:00:53,962
- See you in a little while.
- All right.

787
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,635
- You look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

788
01:01:11,662 --> 01:01:14,564
- You smell very good. What is it?
- Sandalwood.

789
01:01:15,053 --> 01:01:17,737
Don't worry, we don't have to stay long.
She'll understand.

790
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:19,977
- Is that you, Teddy?
- Mama Dell.

791
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,126
Come in, honey.

792
01:01:21,231 --> 01:01:24,614
What's going on here?
You trying to save on the electricity bills?

793
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:26,349
Mama Dell?

794
01:01:26,544 --> 01:01:28,038
<i>I'd like you to meet a...</i>

795
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:31,884
"Happy birthday to you

796
01:01:31,984 --> 01:01:34,800
"Happy birthday to you

797
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:38,793
"Happy birthday, dear Teddy

798
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:42,443
"Happy birthday to you"

799
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:43,917
Well!

800
01:01:45,715 --> 01:01:47,439
How do you like that?

801
01:01:48,019 --> 01:01:49,546
I don't believe it!

802
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:52,914
No. Gilbert!

803
01:01:53,012 --> 01:01:55,762
- What are you doing here? You're in Arizona!
- Happy birthday.

804
01:01:55,861 --> 01:01:57,203
But my birthday's tomorrow.

805
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,446
Ain't no surprise tomorrow.

806
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:01,233
Steetsy, what're you doin' up so late?

807
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:04,051
- It's Steven, now.
- All right, no more Steetsy.

808
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,776
- Happy birthday, honey.
- Thank you.

809
01:02:05,879 --> 01:02:07,570
Thank you, baby. Thank you very much.

810
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,875
You! Devil-woman!

811
01:02:09,975 --> 01:02:10,924
Happy birthday!

812
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:14,098
- What're you doin' to me?
- You should've seen the look on your face.

813
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,818
You know why?
Because it's supposed to be your birthday!

814
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:19,222
- Didi.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

815
01:02:19,608 --> 01:02:21,780
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- My little baby!

816
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:24,150
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- Another little baby.

817
01:02:24,249 --> 01:02:26,005
Daddy, you smell good.

818
01:02:28,474 --> 01:02:30,417
Did I introduce you?

819
01:02:30,778 --> 01:02:31,793
Didi.

820
01:02:32,443 --> 01:02:33,850
Well, let me introduce you.

821
01:02:34,715 --> 01:02:36,657
I was just so overwhelmed.

822
01:02:37,051 --> 01:02:38,907
<i>I'd like you to meet...</i>

823
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,725
<i>This is...</i>

824
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:43,767
<i>Everybody, please say hello to...</i>

825
01:02:45,468 --> 01:02:48,284
You know, you really caught me off guard,
you silly people.

826
01:02:48,382 --> 01:02:50,422
No, honestly, you did. You're silly!

827
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:52,533
You're just silly people.

828
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:56,509
Anyway, no, I do want you to say hello.

829
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,429
- I want you to meet...
- Where's Mama Dell?

830
01:02:58,527 --> 01:03:01,211
Where's that girl? Hello, darling.

831
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,059
Didi. Hello, darling!

832
01:03:08,897 --> 01:03:11,450
Hey, you lost some weight there,
you're lookin' great!

833
01:03:11,553 --> 01:03:13,725
How are you? I didn't know it was a party!

834
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:17,208
- We didn't know you were coming!
- I'm not coming. I mean, I can't stay.

835
01:03:17,314 --> 01:03:20,314
I just wanted to come by
and give the birthday girl a kiss!

836
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:22,590
Happy birthday, sweetie pie!

837
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:27,517
- Did you say hello, Charlotte?
- Hello.

838
01:03:27,748 --> 01:03:30,563
This is my sweetheart, Mama Dell.
This is my sweetheart.

839
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,515
I love this girl!

840
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,003
Hello, Charlotte.

841
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,441
- Sit down, Charlotte.
- No, we can't stay.

842
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,909
- We've got tickets to a...
- It takes two minutes!

843
01:03:40,006 --> 01:03:42,210
She's crazy about music! What can I tell you?

844
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:46,085
No, she a stickler for being on time.
She's trying to reform. No, we can't.

845
01:03:46,183 --> 01:03:48,638
It's a family party, everybody.

846
01:03:48,743 --> 01:03:51,460
Happy birthday, Teddy.
I'll give you your present tomorrow.

847
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:53,315
Good-bye, Mama Dell. Happy birthday!

848
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:54,878
Say good-bye.

849
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,829
Say, good-bye, Charlotte.

850
01:03:57,513 --> 01:03:58,658
Good-bye.

851
01:03:58,888 --> 01:04:00,066
Good-bye.

852
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:02,503
All right. Good-bye, everybody.

853
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,207
Yeah, Daddy, hurry up.

854
01:04:16,748 --> 01:04:19,301
Hold it! I'll be right there.

855
01:04:19,404 --> 01:04:21,793
Bye, Mama. Thank you for everything.

856
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,356
- 'Bye, cuz. See you tomorrow.
- Happy birthday, Teddy.

857
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:25,955
Bye-bye.

858
01:04:26,414 --> 01:04:28,137
Bye! Come back soon.

859
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:31,782
- Now, I told you, you cannot stay up late.
- But let me watch this one show.

860
01:04:31,886 --> 01:04:32,834
No!

861
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:35,880
If it's cotton, and if it's blue, you can't go wrong.

862
01:04:35,982 --> 01:04:38,732
Now don't go neurotic on me.
I loved that present.

863
01:04:38,831 --> 01:04:39,846
Teddy!

864
01:04:39,952 --> 01:04:41,196
I'm sorry. It's your birthday.

865
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:43,368
I hate to run interrupt your celebration.

866
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:45,676
He's flipped out. I think he's gonna kill himself.

867
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:48,046
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Joe!

868
01:04:48,145 --> 01:04:50,960
She left him! She walked out.
I don't know what happened.

869
01:04:51,057 --> 01:04:52,781
- Where is he?
- Across the street.

870
01:04:52,882 --> 01:04:54,224
I'm really sorry.

871
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:57,257
- Teddy's like the voice of reason.
- You did right. It's terrible.

872
01:04:57,362 --> 01:05:00,079
- I'm terrible at this kind of stuff, Didi!
- Michael!

873
01:05:00,179 --> 01:05:03,660
- Joe, I'm right here. Will you talk to me?
- She left me. I gotta kill her.

874
01:05:03,764 --> 01:05:04,909
Joe, calm down.

875
01:05:05,012 --> 01:05:07,401
- You leave me alone so I can kill her!
- Joe!

876
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,883
I gotta kill her!

877
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:10,545
I gotta kill her!

878
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,327
- Calm down! Just calm down.
- Let me kill her.

879
01:05:13,429 --> 01:05:15,022
You'll be all right.

880
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:17,547
Take it easy, you stupid bastards!

881
01:05:17,942 --> 01:05:19,022
I'm finished.

882
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:20,141
I'm done!

883
01:05:20,246 --> 01:05:21,293
Calm down!

884
01:05:21,399 --> 01:05:22,643
I'm finished!

885
01:05:23,382 --> 01:05:25,870
- Teddy, should I go home?
- Yeah!

886
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:29,040
- What?
- Yes! Go home!

887
01:05:29,143 --> 01:05:30,092
It's okay.

888
01:05:30,807 --> 01:05:34,867
- Do you have a key?
- Yes! Get the kids out of here!

889
01:05:34,968 --> 01:05:37,522
All right! Girls, go on. I'll be there in a minute.

890
01:05:38,777 --> 01:05:41,495
- She took my kids again.
- Get in the car.

891
01:05:41,594 --> 01:05:44,463
- Why did she take my kids again?
- It'll be all right tomorrow.

892
01:05:44,570 --> 01:05:46,959
- I want to kill her!
- Get in the driver seat.

893
01:05:47,067 --> 01:05:48,049
Get in the car.

894
01:05:48,154 --> 01:05:51,417
- Shut up, down there!
- Up yours, you half a hard on!

895
01:05:51,515 --> 01:05:53,403
Let me get that peckerhead!

896
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:12,603
Joe, I know you're in a lot of pain,
but I want to tell you something.

897
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:15,353
No, Teddy! I want to tell you something.

898
01:06:18,848 --> 01:06:21,882
- "Happy birthday to you"
- No.

899
01:06:21,984 --> 01:06:24,702
- "Happy birthday to you"
- No.

900
01:06:24,801 --> 01:06:28,478
- "Happy birthday, dear Teddy"
- You fucks! You fucking jerks!

901
01:06:28,577 --> 01:06:30,682
"Happy birthday to you"

902
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:34,748
You're babies, you're little babies,
the biggest assholes I've ever seen my life!

903
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:37,600
- We never said we weren't assholes.
- I said I was an asshole.

904
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:40,121
Where are we going? Will somebody tell me?

905
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:44,865
- Somebody wants to see you.
- She's modeling from midnight till dawn.

906
01:06:44,964 --> 01:06:47,714
And she wants you for breakfast.

907
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,849
What am I supposed to say to her?

908
01:06:50,949 --> 01:06:53,765
You say to her,
"Hello, angel-face, you want to see my goods?"

909
01:06:53,861 --> 01:06:56,098
Get out of here! She wants you. Move it!

910
01:06:56,198 --> 01:06:59,232
- It was her idea. Ask Buddy.
- She likes you. Go figure.

911
01:06:59,335 --> 01:07:02,052
What are you talking about?
Look at that face and those eyes.

912
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:05,250
Look at how that nose sparkles.
What more could you want in a guy?

913
01:07:05,352 --> 01:07:09,214
- How am I supposed to know? Ask Buddy.
- Screw Buddy. I can go for him myself.

914
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:12,736
If he'd just shave his legs, like I keep telling him.
Shave 'em!

915
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,973
- Happy birthday, Teddy!
- Happy birthday, pal!

916
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:19,204
Wait a minute. Come here a sec.

917
01:07:19,305 --> 01:07:22,819
Look, really, in all seriousness,
don't get your dick caught in your zipper.

918
01:07:24,459 --> 01:07:27,176
- You have no taste!
- Taste? Who wants taste?

919
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:30,723
What the hell am I? Charlie the Tuna?
Get out of here. Let's get action.

920
01:07:30,827 --> 01:07:34,210
We're running out of laughs.
Let's go to the opera, drop our pants.

921
01:09:13,372 --> 01:09:15,194
Now, listen here, Teddy bear.

922
01:09:15,388 --> 01:09:16,795
Four weeks ago...

923
01:09:16,893 --> 01:09:19,261
...I met a cute, available...

924
01:09:19,357 --> 01:09:20,765
...old-fashioned guy...

925
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:22,836
...who liked horse riding.

926
01:09:24,574 --> 01:09:26,036
In one month...

927
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,670
...you got married...

928
01:09:28,255 --> 01:09:30,263
...you had two daughters...

929
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,658
...and you can't ride a horse to save your life.

930
01:09:35,808 --> 01:09:37,848
Don't stare at your shoes, look at me.

931
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,771
Because since tonight...

932
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,660
...I want you more...

933
01:09:42,433 --> 01:09:45,019
...then I ever wanted any other man.

934
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,084
Can you tell me why?

935
01:09:49,858 --> 01:09:51,200
I don't know.

936
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:22,117
You've been dreaming about this
for a long time, haven't you?

937
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:26,981
This isn't a dream anymore.

938
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:29,576
This is really happening.

939
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:09,389
So, where do you want to break the ice?
Here or in bed?

940
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:13,383
<i>Well...</i>

941
01:11:13,488 --> 01:11:14,470
Let's see.

942
01:11:15,888 --> 01:11:16,816
I don't mind really.

943
01:11:16,913 --> 01:11:18,921
This is nice here.

944
01:11:19,281 --> 01:11:21,671
The bed is good,
bed might be comfortable, but...

945
01:11:22,033 --> 01:11:25,132
<i>...lots of interesting chairs,
and stools, couches...</i>

946
01:11:25,234 --> 01:11:26,641
Come on, let's go to bed.

947
01:11:47,861 --> 01:11:49,269
It's a water bed.

948
01:11:50,998 --> 01:11:52,373
This should be fun.

949
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:55,537
Wait a minute. Do you come
into bed with your shoes and socks?

950
01:11:57,592 --> 01:11:58,672
Sorry.

951
01:12:24,572 --> 01:12:26,776
Don't want to start a fire.
They landed on the lamp.

952
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,698
Do you mind taking them off?

953
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:32,244
Sorry.

954
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:11,995
Come and get it, cowboy.

955
01:13:26,054 --> 01:13:27,101
Hello?

956
01:13:27,206 --> 01:13:28,188
<i>Charlotte?</i>

957
01:13:30,983 --> 01:13:32,161
<i>Charlotte!</i>

958
01:13:33,895 --> 01:13:34,823
Yes!

959
01:13:40,552 --> 01:13:41,567
What is it?

960
01:13:41,768 --> 01:13:43,776
Nothing, my husband's downstairs.

961
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:47,230
- Your husband!
- Yeah. Hurry up, come on, get dressed!

962
01:13:47,529 --> 01:13:49,635
What do you mean, "Hurry up"?
What husband?

963
01:13:49,737 --> 01:13:51,014
Please, hurry up!

964
01:13:51,114 --> 01:13:54,016
- He wasn't due back until Friday.
- But it's only Wednesday.

965
01:13:54,123 --> 01:13:57,538
Yeah, you want to ask him why?
He's six-foot-two and he's an airline pilot.

966
01:13:57,643 --> 01:14:00,360
If he finds you here, he's going to kill you.
Get dressed.

967
01:14:36,945 --> 01:14:38,887
What are you doing in my husband's robe?

968
01:14:38,994 --> 01:14:40,783
I'm not going to get caught half-dressed!

969
01:14:40,882 --> 01:14:43,948
Why play games?
I'll talk to him man to man, that's all.

970
01:14:44,051 --> 01:14:46,953
Are you crazy?
He's going to tear your balls apart!

971
01:14:47,059 --> 01:14:49,776
- What are you doing? Where are we going?
- Quickly, get outside!

972
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:53,291
- This is a window!
- I know it's a window. It's this or the door.

973
01:14:53,396 --> 01:14:56,212
You must be joking! That's 100 feet down there.

974
01:14:56,308 --> 01:14:57,869
Please! I won't be very long.

975
01:14:57,973 --> 01:15:00,013
- Come on, Charlotte!
- I won't be long.

976
01:15:00,117 --> 01:15:02,671
He's probably got a taxi waiting.
He never stays long.

977
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:04,779
Just stand out on the ledge.

978
01:15:05,174 --> 01:15:07,892
- Please, quickly. Don't worry. It's safe.
- God.

979
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:11,024
- Now, just wait for me there.
- Jesus.

980
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,464
Coming, darling.

981
01:15:47,421 --> 01:15:48,948
Get away.

982
01:16:05,344 --> 01:16:06,718
Who is that?

983
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,194
My God!

984
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:40,220
Better call the fire department!
There's a man about to jump off of that building!

985
01:16:57,705 --> 01:17:00,126
- What's up, babe? Where we goin'?
- Suicide.

986
01:17:11,018 --> 01:17:13,801
No! Not the ladder! It scares them.

987
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,971
It makes them jump every time! Take it down!

988
01:17:16,075 --> 01:17:18,377
Take it out of here, take it down!

989
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,306
<i>Come on, people, a little cooperation here!</i>

990
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:27,333
<i>Let's have some cooperation. This is
a dangerous area. We've got a man up there.</i>

991
01:17:29,038 --> 01:17:31,460
<i>Come on, folks.</i>

992
01:17:36,015 --> 01:17:37,804
<i>Come on, folks. Give us a break.</i>

993
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:40,461
Excuse me.

994
01:17:47,025 --> 01:17:48,486
Roger, we got it!

995
01:17:48,593 --> 01:17:50,251
- You got him?
- I got him.

996
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,544
<i>Come on, people.</i>

997
01:17:55,026 --> 01:17:58,988
<i>Okay, stand by.
Fine, we have reached the network.</i>

998
01:17:59,794 --> 01:18:01,321
<i>Stand by. Counting down.</i>

999
01:18:01,427 --> 01:18:05,224
<i>Five-four-three-two-one. You're on.</i>

1000
01:18:05,555 --> 01:18:08,589
<i>Good morning.
This is Marvin Kausberg, Channel 5 news.</i>

1001
01:18:09,556 --> 01:18:11,280
That looks a little like Daddy.

1002
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:13,585
<i>...a man was seen on the ledge of a ninth-floor...</i>

1003
01:18:13,685 --> 01:18:14,667
It does!

1004
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:17,419
<i>The identity of the man is not yet known.</i>

1005
01:18:17,941 --> 01:18:22,285
<i>The police have arrived and the fire department
suicide team, plus a substantial crowd.</i>

1006
01:18:22,838 --> 01:18:25,392
<i>All of us waiting here,
in the small courtyard below...</i>

1007
01:18:25,495 --> 01:18:28,725
<i>...are very unclear as to
what the man's motives are.</i>

1008
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:30,679
<i>He appears relaxed.</i>

1009
01:18:31,063 --> 01:18:35,025
<i>In fact, he's seated on a small window sill,
smoking a cigarette.</i>

1010
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,365
<i>But he looks disturbed by all the attention...</i>

1011
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:40,465
<i>...as he hides his face
and waves the crowd away.</i>

1012
01:18:40,569 --> 01:18:42,577
<i>The police are trying to control the crowd...</i>

1013
01:18:42,682 --> 01:18:44,505
<i>...who are now calling for the man to jump.</i>

1014
01:18:44,602 --> 01:18:46,196
<i>The question being asked here today...</i>

1015
01:18:46,298 --> 01:18:49,648
<i>...is whether this man
does or does not want to commit suicide.</i>

1016
01:18:50,363 --> 01:18:51,574
Teddy!

1017
01:18:53,915 --> 01:18:55,322
Two, three.

1018
01:18:58,076 --> 01:19:00,051
It'll be all right!

1019
01:19:00,573 --> 01:19:02,875
We'll catch you!

1020
01:19:09,118 --> 01:19:10,132
Dive!

1021
01:19:19,904 --> 01:19:22,392
- Baby!
- That's so good.

1022
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:34,264
Yes!

1023
01:19:40,611 --> 01:19:42,499
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

1024
01:19:43,556 --> 01:19:45,378
<i>I have a wonderful wife!</i>

1025
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,035
Jump!

1026
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,137
<i>I could have thrown my whole life away.</i>

1027
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:52,899
<i>And for what?</i>

1028
01:19:53,221 --> 01:19:54,563
<i>A piece of ass.</i>

1029
01:20:09,576 --> 01:20:13,351
<i>What's that girl doing?
What is she doing, taking more pictures?</i>

1030
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:15,780
<i>No, give me a break!</i>

1031
01:20:16,777 --> 01:20:18,087
<i>She is cute, though.</i>

1032
01:20:18,921 --> 01:20:20,296
<i>Look at those legs!</i>

1033
01:20:20,394 --> 01:20:23,361
<i>Hey, come on, now, stop it. None of that stuff.</i>

1034
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:25,921
<i>I made a mistake, I learned my lesson...</i>

1035
01:20:26,027 --> 01:20:28,394
<i>...and I will never do it again.</i>
