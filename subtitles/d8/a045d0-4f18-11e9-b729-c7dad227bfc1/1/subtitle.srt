"Tea house"

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,791
"Iron Monkey"

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,639
It's so cold,
how can the refugees stand it?

4
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,188
There's been lots of natural
disasters recently.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,111
And even more corrupt officials.

6
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,159
Another arrives today.
He's well known for his evil ways.

7
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,993
Do you think Iron Monkey will appear?

8
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,314
"The Government House of Chekiang"

9
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,749
Follow me... this way.

10
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,675
Please have some dim sum first.
Masters, the midnight snack is ready.

11
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,548
Enough! Not while we're listening
for any movement on the roof.

12
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,473
Masters, help yourselves.

13
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,671
"Honesty and Justice for all"

14
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,715
If the food isn't on time,
forget it.

15
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,951
Clumsy fool. Leave us!
We're trying to catch Iron Monkey.

16
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,753
I heard the monks were brought
from the Shaolin Temple.

17
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,989
Who knows?

18
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,877
Let's have a midnight snack.

19
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,790
Stop squashing me, you girls.

20
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,356
Don't keep climbing
in and out of bed.

21
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,318
Do you want Iron Monkey
to know my treasure is down there?

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,595
- Come out!
- I just want my share.

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,831
Do you really want
to divide it up now?

24
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,319
Quick, hide!

25
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,389
Sir.

26
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,550
It's the head of security, Fox.

27
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,313
I've got abalone and ginseng soup
for you and your wives.

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,391
Do you think now is the time?

29
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,074
Don't touch it
or I'll deduct half a year's salary!

30
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,149
I wouldn't dare.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,195
On the roof!

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,392
There's something happening up there!
Shoot!

33
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,271
Not even a bird can get in.

34
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,511
If Iron Monkey comes,
we'll turn him into a hedgehog!

35
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,069
It is I, Iron Monkey!

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,269
Master.

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,951
Stand to, men! Stand to!

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,633
Stay calm.

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,555
There are too many of you.
Get out of the way!

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,838
Master, it's us.

41
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,639
Get out of the way, you men!

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,348
Catch him!

43
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,793
You men stay put.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,273
He wants to lead us into a trap.
Stay at your posts.

45
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,588
Yes, sir.

46
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,077
You can't escape this time,
Iron Monkey.

47
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,195
You aren't monks!

48
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,234
- You dare mock us Shaolin?
- To hell with Shaolin.

49
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,231
You call yourselves Shaolin monks?

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,758
I'll teach you impostors a lesson!

51
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,512
Good always triumphs over evil!

52
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,797
You call yourself good?
Aiding corruption is never good.

53
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,597
You know it's wrong, so don't do it!

54
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,758
He got in!

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,998
Honey, help me escape
and I'll give you your share.

56
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,958
- It's too late now!
- Go to hell!

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,317
Officer Cheng, set the trap off!

58
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,750
I am too cunning, you can't beat me!

59
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,872
See you later!

60
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,829
Lower the net!
You're a lucky man, sir.

61
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,276
You said the net was impenetrable!
Go and take a look!

62
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,436
- Go and check the roof.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,828
Shaolin!

64
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,110
- Be careful.
- It's very high.

65
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,159
Damned Iron Monkey.
I'm not going to buy a coffin

66
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,312
before I spend all this money.
I'll thank my lucky stars.

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,189
Your Excellency,

68
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,431
I've posted guards everywhere,
I don't think he'll get in again.

69
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,355
What is this?

70
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,274
Shark fin? I told you not to eat it!

71
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,918
- No, sir.
- Deduct your salary.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,399
I broke the bowl accidentally...

73
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,710
Your Excellency,
there's no sign of him.

74
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,792
Everyone will be deducted a month's
salary to go to a reward.

75
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,030
If you can't catch him,
the money is mine!

76
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,155
Damn you all, fools!

77
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,992
What company are you from?

78
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,672
Fox, you're smart, don't blink.

79
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,433
Your Excellency, Iron Monkey!

80
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,988
Thank you for your donation
to the flood appeal.

81
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,556
Thank you for your jewels,
your donation to the disaster.

82
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,074
Because of your kind donation,
I won't kill you.

83
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,516
You've already taken my life!

84
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,312
Iron Monkey is wanted again.

85
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,311
Let's see if this officer
can get him.

86
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,710
Mr. Fox, those who haven't been caught
by the government must thank God.

87
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,472
If he's caught, then we'll thank God.

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,838
This is a little gift
sent to you by my master.

89
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,718
He intends to make
the Islamic Temple into a brothel.

90
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,997
When the application is submitted,

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,719
perhaps His Excellency
would look on it favourably.

92
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,997
Say, we can make money together.
How could we make a deal without you?

93
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,273
His Excellency is in a bad mood.
I have to bargain with him directly.

94
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,557
Take the gifts back or I won't be
able to repay it if any is lost.

95
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,595
Iron...

96
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,314
Don't mention the name,
it's bad luck.

97
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,676
One month of our salary has been
deducted.

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,830
We have to pay our own medical bills.

99
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,195
Thank you for the money,
which solves our problem.

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,633
Come and thank Mr. Chan.

101
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,073
Thank you.

102
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,678
"Pa Cho Hall"

103
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,552
- Old man, is your throat sore?
- Yes.

104
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,474
- Do you also have diarrhea?
- Yes.

105
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,755
All right, give me your hand.

106
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,070
What's wrong with me, Doctor?

107
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,596
You are sexually overactive.
Your kidney is weak.

108
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,390
You are always eating shark's fin
and ginseng. Such food makes you hot.

109
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,675
You are too weak
to afford such nutritious foods.

110
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,035
How can nutritious foods
cause illness?

111
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,315
How is this possible?
What should I do, Doctor?

112
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,153
I'm telling you the truth.
It's making you weak.

113
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,275
One hundred dollars.

114
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,839
One hundred dollars!

115
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,673
I don't have that much, Doctor.

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,515
Don't worry, old man. You can go,
I won't take a penny from you.

117
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,353
Thank you.

118
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,955
Why is he free
and yet you charge me so much?

119
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,438
You're a rich man,
so your medicine is expensive.

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,956
If you can't afford it, I'll
prescribe cheaper medicines for you.

121
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,473
I not afford it? Pay him.

122
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,792
You really do cure him.

123
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,229
Thank you.

124
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,548
You're looking better.

125
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,790
- Doctor Yang.
- Master Fox.

126
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,314
Good business.
So many patients in your clinic.

127
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,994
You are such a versatile doctor.

128
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,073
Most of them come from Hoi Ning. They
have the plague as well as flooding.

129
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,799
They've been walking for three days.

130
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,632
What? The plague?

131
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,878
It's horrible!

132
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,554
Oh, here's Miss Orchid.

133
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,191
Obstipantia, disinfectants, check the
herb list, don't make any mistakes.

134
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,316
It's as busy as a restaurant in here.

135
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,435
Miss Orchid.

136
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,431
Master Fox. What's wrong with you?


137
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,354
Nothing. You're getting rich
from such a prosperous business.

138
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,953
I heard Iron Monkey was arrested,
is that true?

139
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,713
I got him in my Pallium Stance.
He couldn't move.

140
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,031
I gave him another severe blow
before he could do anything.

141
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,034
That's what happened to him?

142
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,838
Yeah, that's what happened.

143
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,115
That's great
that you caught Iron Monkey.

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,910
So many of my colleagues
had been hurt,

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,992
I gave him a chance to mend his ways
and I let him go.

146
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,789
Master Fox, every time you set a trap
to catch Iron Monkey,

147
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,429
you always let him go free.
You're giving him too many chances.

148
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,311
I guess I owe him.

149
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,392
He appeared two years ago
when I was transferred to this town.

150
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,313
One day I'll tear his mask off!

151
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,308
Master Fox,
if you feel the heat, let go.

152
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,789
So hot...!

153
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,509
What's wrong with a light touch?
Were you the hooker from the brothel?

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,034
We're a little short of girls.
Come and join us.

155
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,235
Get lost!

156
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,309
How dare you!

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,590
How dare you be so rude here!
Find your hookers elsewhere.

158
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,151
Are you Master Fox?
We are friends, please forgive...

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,360
This clinic is under my protection.
No vulgar behaviour is allowed here!

160
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,351
Master Fox, show me some respect.

161
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,034
If you do,
I'll give you 100 pieces of gold.

162
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,798
How dare you bribe me so openly!
Take him to the cells!

163
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,836
How dare you! I'll sue you...

164
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,196
You won't even get to see
the governor without my say so.

165
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,508
Go!

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,355
"Chinese Herbs Cure Disease"

167
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,919
Thank you, Master Fox.

168
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,716
Master Fox, take this medicine
for your fellow soldiers.

169
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,873
Apply it to their wounds twice daily
and they'll be cured in 3-4 days.

170
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,190
- Thank you.
- Take care.

171
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,112
The new officer is coming,

172
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,112
I'm sure Iron Monkey will come
and make trouble.

173
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,792
I hope he doesn't appear again.

174
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,632
Master Fox, be careful.

175
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,157
- Good morning, Dr Yang.
- Good morning.

176
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,355
Mr. Fox... Are you thinking
he may be Iron Monkey?

177
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,070
Everyone seems to be Iron Monkey
in my eyes.

178
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,998
"Pa Cho Hall"

179
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,078
Cook it for longer, then the abalone
will taste much better.

180
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,676
You're lying, that's not abalone,
it's just some tree bark.

181
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,318
A monkey screeching?

182
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,037
It's real gold!
Iron Monkey has come to save us.

183
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,236
Give it to me. I'm in charge.

184
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,114
Who threw that?

185
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,872
It's Iron Monkey.

186
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,598
He's too greedy.

187
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,912
I'm not greedy. Let's share it
amongst us. Thank you, Iron Monkey.

188
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,033
It's so cold...
The building's falling down!

189
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,918
No, it's gold,
it must be Iron Monkey.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,638
Thank you, Iron Monkey.

191
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,954
What's up? Work harder!

192
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,909
All these refugees are so cheap. I'll
get some strong men tomorrow instead!

193
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,150
Work harder or do you want a beating?

194
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,595
We haven't eaten all day.

195
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,433
Right, my dog's hungry too!

196
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,634
Don't expect any pity.
I'll employ someone else tomorrow!

197
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,754
A dead rat!

198
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,431
Who's there? Who threw that?

199
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,078
Bullying kids, revolting!

200
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,193
Iron Monkey really exists!
Iron Monkey the Merciful.

201
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,111
Iron Monkey?

202
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,797
Let me help you.

203
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,440
You still come out
in this awful weather.

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,040
The new officer, Cheng Pak Fong
arrests people for no reason.

205
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,712
He is beating the people up.

206
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,433
I will visit him tomorrow
and teach him a lesson.

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,834
Vegetables and tofu for every meal.

208
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,036
It's so boring, Master!

209
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,998
Are you really so poor you have to
take up an official post?

210
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,470
If we can't find the money,
we wouldn't even have this to eat.

211
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,156
I may as well go back to the brothel.

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,109
It's hard work supporting
all of my nine mistresses.

213
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,990
OK, I'll open the storeroom
and sell it all. Then we can leave.

214
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,594
Make sure you get a good price,
then we'll leave.

215
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,238
All you think about is food.

216
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
Boy, come here.

217
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,080
Sir, I don't have any money left.

218
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,548
Your salary is worthless.
Follow me to the storeroom.

219
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,915
Sir, it is a letter from the capital.

220
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,995
Sir, is it a good position?

221
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,154
The State Governor is coming
to investigate me.

222
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,390
If Iron Monkey appears,
then we're in trouble.

223
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,153
Why are you still standing there?

224
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,676
Arrest Iron Monkey. Arrest anyone
who's remotely connected to him!

225
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,715
Yes, sir.

226
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,351
"Huang the Invincible's
Last Apprentice"

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,238
- What move are you practising?
- The Monkey's Palm.

228
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,435
- Really?
- Yes.

229
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,511
- Right, let's go.
- Why?

230
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,477
You said the word 'monkey'.

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,074
The word monkey brings trouble.
Take the sign down.

232
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,833
Arrest those whose name is Monkey.
Still want to run away?

233
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,231
You look like a monkey,
take him away.

234
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,073
Sir, since when is a sneeze
an offence?

235
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,469
You act like a monkey. Take him away!

236
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,391
Monkey and date powder!

237
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,595
What are you selling?

238
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,113
Don't mention the word monkey.

239
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,155
Look for yourself.

240
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,437
You won't even say what you’re
selling? You must be scared.

241
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,475
Take him away!

242
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,351
- Hold on tight.
- Yes, Dad.

243
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,475
Dad.

244
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,712
Fei-hung, you're old enough
to walk on your own now!

245
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,994
Recite the herb list.

246
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,992
Chiretta, good for blood.
Ginseng, good for respiration.

247
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,312
Crocodile, to cure catarrh.
Lizard to treat poisoning. Tin-tsi...

248
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,351
Tin-tsi...

249
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,236
To cure swelling, you fool.

250
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,959
Tin-tsi to cure swelling, you fool.

251
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,955
- Boss.
- Master, Wong.

252
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,474
The herbs are all ready.

253
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,075
I'm going back to Fushan tomorrow.
Please send them to my lodgings.

254
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,559
No problem.

255
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,677
That's all you've made
from a whole day's work?

256
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:32,196
Do you think this is a charity house?
If you have nothing, you must steal.

257
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,918
Watch yourselves.

258
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,635
Who did that?

259
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,269
Fei-hung, honest people
don't do such sneaky things.

260
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,395
Shoot at me?

261
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,950
Go back to the inn
and practise foot work for two hours.

262
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,309
Go pick his pocket.

263
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,275
What are you doing picking pockets
at your age?

264
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,316
I'll never do it again, sir.

265
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,358
I'll let you go this time,
but you’d better not do it again.

266
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,115
You are lucky.
I have to practise for two hours.

267
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,951
What's wrong with practising?

268
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,758
What's so bad about stealing?

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,479
Is it good to teach you a lesson?

270
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,759
- He could be Iron Monkey.
- I think you're right.

271
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,114
Dad.

272
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,472
Stop! You're disturbing the peace.
Come with us.

273
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,788
He stole my stuff.

274
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,475
I didn't see that,
but I did see you fight. This way.

275
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,317
Why are they only arresting them?

276
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,993
"Honesty and Justice for all"

277
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,479
Don't act so pitifully!

278
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,757
Behind your ignorant faces,

279
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,196
any one of you may be
the terrible Iron Monkey.

280
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,350
Speak up! Show yourself!

281
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,678
Be sensible.
I'll release anyone who speaks up.

282
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,390
I'll release those who give me
any information about Iron Monkey.

283
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,479
Speak out!

284
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,637
Sir, there's a monkey
flashing his backside at your.

285
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,118
How dare you disgrace this court
like this!

286
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,590
I hate indecency! Take him away
and punish him severely!

287
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,320
Sir, you will be eating
monkey's brain tonight.

288
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,231
Don't tell my mistresses.

289
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,556
If no one confesses,
you will all be fined 50 dollars.

290
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,392
50 dollars? Is that all?

291
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,708
What do you expect?

292
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,918
Under the circumstances,
each of you are fined 500 dollars!

293
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,273
If you can't pay,
it's the brand for you!

294
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,072
Where are you now, Iron Monkey?

295
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,232
If you were a real hero,
you would come out.

296
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,154
You look pissed off.

297
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,555
Execute!

298
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,999
Dad! You can't do this
without any proof, Your Excellency.

299
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,071
How dare you!

300
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,515
He presumes to tell you
how to govern, sir.

301
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,357
How dare you be so rude to me at such
a young age. Give him 30 lashes!

302
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,878
He is just a child, sir.

303
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,838
If you plead for him,
you will be suspect.

304
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,514
Your Excellency, he is too young.
He can't take it.

305
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,639
If he wants to escape the punishment,
he has to pay, otherwise punish him!

306
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,029
Don't move!

307
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,839
Your Excellency, you are punishing
the innocent, Iron Monkey's here.

308
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,957
If it wasn't for my cunning, you'd
never have come out during the day.

309
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,270
You're trapped! Positions, gun troop!

310
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,154
Kill him!

311
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,953
He's gone outside! Go after him!

312
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,270
If this is how you behave,
you'd best resign!

313
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,149
Your eyebrows! They're gone!

314
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,710
What? They brought me good luck.
Now I'm going to be unlucky.

315
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,519
Iron Monkey,
I arrest you to save the innocent.

316
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,915
Who are you?

317
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,991
- You're good.
- So are you.

318
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,079
My foot.

319
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,035
It's so exciting.
They're such good kung fu masters.

320
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,951
- Put the ladders up.
- Yes, sir!

321
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,875
It's a kid.

322
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,311
- Fei-hung, are you OK?
- Yes, I'm fine.

323
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,479
You're a great fighter, hero.

324
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,358
- My father's well known in...
- Boy. He has such a big mouth.

325
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,635
He is as powerful as Iron Monkey.

326
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,914
Sir, Iron Monkey was here,
so we're proved innocent.

327
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,194
May we leave now?

328
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,317
No! You could well be his partner.

329
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,234
No one will be released
until he is caught.

330
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,435
Very wise, sir.

331
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,229
Let us go. Show mercy, please, sir.

332
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,473
Sir, if I, Wong Kei-ying,

333
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,950
take responsibility for catching
Iron Monkey, will you let them go?

334
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,759
- Wong Kei-ying from Canton?
- Yes, sir.

335
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,989
Nice to meet you.

336
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,310
Wong Kei-ying is very famous.

337
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,914
More famous than me?

338
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,356
Wong Kei-ying,
I'll show mercy this time.

339
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,989
Arrest Iron Monkey
before seven days are up.

340
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,117
I will keep your son here
in the meantime.

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,077
You're detaining my son?

342
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,912
Your belongings too!

343
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,675
With your son in jail,
you won't escape.

344
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,795
Court adjourned!

345
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,835
- Are you going alone?
- I'll arrest Iron Monkey soon.

346
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,916
Don't worry, I'll look after him.

347
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,035
Thank you.

348
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,513
Set them free.

349
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,276
He's helping arrest Iron Monkey?

350
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,759
What a bastard!

351
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,917
Come this way.
The noodles are delicious.

352
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,279
Another bowl of noodles. I'm sure
you'll enjoy such delicious noodles.

353
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,195
Noodles, please.

354
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:08,319
Are you Wong Kei-ying
who fought Iron Monkey?

355
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,355
I am.

356
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,591
Shame on you.
I won't sell you anything. Go!

357
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,994
- Why?
- Ask the fortune teller.

358
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,468
Why?

359
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,313
Can I have two buns, please?

360
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,595
I won't sell you anything, bastard.

361
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,113
Who are calling bastard?

362
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,393
I'll pay.

363
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,995
I won't sell it to you, if you want
it you’ll have to steal it.

364
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,035
I'll take my money.

365
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,669
Thief! Wong Kei-ying is a thief!
He's robbing my money! Thief!

366
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,472
Bastard!

367
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,396
Do you want a bun? Five cents each.

368
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,595
So expensive?

369
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,638
It's not expensive.
I'm risking my life to sell to you.

370
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,274
I quit! I'm sorry.

371
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,197
Hot buns.

372
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,157
I'll take 20 buns.

373
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,229
Thanks.

374
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,357
They can't tell right from wrong.

375
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,596
Honest people don't do sneaky things.

376
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,952
Except this time.

377
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,316
Luckily Fei-hung isn't around.

378
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,994
That fell on the ground, are you sure
you want to eat it, my friend?

379
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,396
I'm so hungry, I haven't eaten in two
days. I don't care if it's dirty.

380
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,711
I don't know why,
but they refuse to sell me food here.

381
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,030
You seem to be a stranger here.

382
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,908
Don't eat that.

383
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,514
- Come and have some soup.
- Soup?

384
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,953
Sorry about my stomach.
I'm so hungry. If it had been rice...

385
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,115
You are so slow.

386
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,395
You are too slow at frying.
When can I eat?

387
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,550
I'm sorry, Master Wong,
I'm a bit slow.

388
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,552
- Not at all.
- Be patient, it will be ready soon.

389
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,154
Master Wong,

390
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,475
we grow a special kind of chilli,
which we call sweating, it's so hot.

391
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,675
Even a little makes your nose run.
You must try some later.

392
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,675
Water.

393
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,039
Are you thirsty?

394
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,078
Don't drink water, there's the soup.

395
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,996
I wasn't thirsty, I was just cleaning
my mouth so the soup tastes better.

396
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,072
Remember to wear an apron the next
time you want to clean your mouth.

397
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,390
Let me help you, Miss Ho.

398
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,074
I can prepare some dishes
from home for you.

399
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,519
Golden chicken, it smells delicious!
Master Wong, you are a great cook.

400
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,714
My wife passed away a while ago,
so I do all the housework myself.

401
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,918
Master Wong, we are honoured
to have you cooking for us.

402
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,560
It's only Cantonese food,
please try some.

403
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,837
Well, let us Northerners
and Southerners sit down together.

404
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,071
Let me make some Northern
speciality noodles for you.

405
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,592
The first slice, God's blessing.

406
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,715
The second slice,
no more natural disasters.

407
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,394
The third, peace and prosperity.

408
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,391
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

409
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,278
The wine brings friends together.

410
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,396
To all the friends we've known.

411
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,515
Cheers.

412
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

413
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,310
Master Wong, what is worrying you?

414
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,630
I am thinking of my son.

415
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,631
I have all this great food here.

416
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,599
But my son is behind bars and I don't
know if he's eaten at all.

417
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,194
I don't know if anyone
is looking after him.

418
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,000
Dr Yang, have you heard
of Iron Monkey?

419
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,518
Yes, I've heard the talk.
Do you want to find him?

420
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,477
If I catch him,
I'll chop his head off!

421
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,073
Is he your enemy?

422
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,436
The governor is keeping my son
in jail until I arrest Iron Monkey.

423
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,354
If I can't catch him, my son
and I can never go back to Fushan.

424
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,112
Both the good and bad are against us.

425
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,636
- What's your son's name?
- Wong Fei-hung.

426
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,039
Wong Fei-hung.

427
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,678
I won't bother you any further.

428
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,070
The quicker I catch Iron Monkey,
the quicker I see my son.

429
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,155
Dr Yang, Miss Ho,
I'll repay you one day.

430
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,151
See you soon.

431
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,633
Master Wong, knock on the door
when you are tired.

432
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,995
We stay up quite late.

433
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,473
- Thank you.
- Take care.

434
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,475
- Orchid...
- I know, you're going for the boy.

435
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,677
The officers won't look after him.

436
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,676
Take the medicine box. It will help.

437
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,554
I'm thirsty, some water, please.

438
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,471
Shut up!

439
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,870
Why does this child sleep
the whole day long?

440
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,157
Is he OK?
Does he need to see a doctor?

441
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,708
Whoever loses has to drink.

442
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,949
Master Fox...

443
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,029
Open the gate.

444
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,032
Wong Fei-hung, you have a visitor.

445
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,759
His forehead is hot and his mouth
is dry, Dr Yang. I think he is sick.

446
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,398
He can't stay here any more.

447
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,153
It's lucky we discovered it now.
Many people have caught the plague.

448
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,434
The plague?

449
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,397
It's not that bad, don't panic.

450
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,472
We're not panicking,
we're just afraid.

451
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,189
The investigator will arrive
in the next two days.

452
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,233
I can't take care of him.

453
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,599
Master Fox, conditions here are
appalling. Let him stay in my house.

454
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,199
Sorry to trouble you.

455
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,748
Don't start anything
or I'll punish you!

456
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,595
We won't cause any trouble.
We're happy you're moving him.

457
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,793
Dad's umbrella.

458
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,078
Master Wong!

459
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,832
- Come over for a midnight snack.
- OK.

460
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,635
Having a hotpot on the roof
makes it taste even nicer.

461
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,551
I've never done it before.

462
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,032
- Help yourself.
- All right.

463
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,271
Master Fox, thank you
for looking after my son.

464
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,909
Master Wong, if you can't catch
Iron Monkey on time,

465
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,436
I'll work something out
so you and your son can leave.

466
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,636
Don't worry.

467
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,278
But you might get in trouble.

468
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,079
I may be a bad official,
but I can protect myself.

469
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,912
A hero should be respected.

470
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,675
Hero?

471
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,634
People hold thieves up as heroes.

472
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,311
In fact, we are all just water
in the pot,

473
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,436
heated by the burning fire.

474
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,159
If the fire keeps burning,
the water will dry up.

475
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,193
Who can put out the fire?

476
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,314
When will we get good officials?

477
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,838
Damn it! Who's blocking the chimney?

478
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,789
Iron Monkey?

479
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,678
Hey! Wait for me!

480
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,074
Which one of you is Iron Monkey?

481
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,638
I am Master Fox,
you are under arrest.

482
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,831
Kidnap a woman? A rapist?

483
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,553
- The Shaolin Palm?
- You practise Shaolin kung fu.

484
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,030
- So what?
- Are you Shaolin apprentices?

485
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,109
A monk?

486
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,073
No Shadow Kick!

487
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,548
- The Super Eagle's Claw!
- Your master is the monk, Hin Hung.

488
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,200
You are a Shaolin rebel.

489
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,155
Dad, look out.

490
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,391
Here comes Iron Monkey.
Be careful.

491
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,469
Fei-hung.

492
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,995
It's you.

493
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,878
Tell Dad I'm OK.

494
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,000
The old one
worries about the young one.

495
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,869
The young one
worries about the old one.

496
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,834
Such a caring father and son.

497
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,114
I know who you are.

498
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,398
What did he say?

499
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,994
Ask him when he wakes up.

500
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,873
Difficult to distinguish you

501
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,589
A face of weariness

502
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,714
It's difficult to predict my fate

503
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,673
Orchid, Peony,
come and greet the guests.

504
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,238
My son.

505
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,033
My son.

506
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,359
It's time to see clients again.
It's been nine months. Get ready.

507
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,154
How dare you stab me!

508
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,559
Bitch!

509
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,032
I want to redeem Miss Ho.

510
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,951
Take the three gold pieces.

511
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,229
Willows and flowers follow the wind

512
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:23,279
A doctor cares
for patients from all parts

513
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,113
Maybe for the fulfillment
of our commitment

514
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,999
Count the fortune of your life

515
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,994
You go that way and you go that way.

516
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,117
How can you mess up
in the Governor's house?

517
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,555
Shit! Where is the Governor?

518
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,959
Hold it...

519
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,996
You want to see His Excellency.
Do you have an appointment?

520
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,188
Idiot!
Does the investigator need one?

521
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,511
Use the royal fan
to hit these bastards.

522
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,750
The royal fan?

523
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,308
Looks like this place
hasn't changed much.

524
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,756
I didn't see you on my last patrol.

525
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,672
- Are you new?
- I've been here two years now.

526
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,151
Did you check his identification?

527
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,117
I didn't dare, I'm only a junior.

528
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,952
Stop moving. I'm getting all wet!

529
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,031
Give me a kiss.

530
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,955
Turn your head.

531
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,876
How can I fix it
while you move about so much?

532
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,713
Do a good job for me.

533
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,749
Who are you?

534
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,149
You knew I was coming.

535
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:02,230
Look at the time.
How can you play in such a way?

536
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,634
Your Excellency.

537
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,189
Get the documents.
Come and see me once you are dressed.

538
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,269
Yes, sir.

539
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,791
I'm a busy man. Don't waste my time.

540
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,239
The royal fan?

541
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,634
Isn't that the royal fan?

542
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,837
I had the pleasure
of being hit with it.

543
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,957
Have you seen his royal seal?

544
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,031
I'm only a junior, I dared not ask.

545
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,795
Idiot. Help me get dressed.

546
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,076
How can you be Governor?
These documents are a mess!

547
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,753
Please forgive me, sir.

548
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,273
- Pick them up.
- Yes, sir.

549
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,950
May I see the royal seal?

550
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,591
You can't have done this job long.
Don’t you know who I am?

551
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,515
Bring me my briefcase.

552
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,430
Where are my papers?

553
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,749
What's this?

554
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,878
Iron Monkey?!

555
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,633
Iron Monkey? What is it?

556
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,517
He is a notorious criminal.

557
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,239
He commits all sorts
of horrible crimes.

558
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,478
This is ridiculous!

559
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,835
I didn't blame you
for not keeping the peace,

560
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,070
but how can you allow thieves
in this house?

561
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,151
How can you be Governor?

562
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,434
Please forgive me.

563
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,318
How can my official seal
turn into a monkey?

564
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,833
"Honesty and Justice for all"

565
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,194
Court in session!

566
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,637
They look innocent, but in reality
they may be that vicious Iron Monkey!

567
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:58,675
Confess now!

568
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,513
- Who stole the seal?
- Hand it over!

569
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,194
Don't act so innocent in front of me.

570
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,669
Your Excellency, I think...

571
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,036
I'm a kind-hearted official.
I love my citizens.

572
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,759
But you can't be soft
with these guys!

573
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,200
He sounds familiar to me.

574
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,829
You always say that. It proves
you come from the same class.

575
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,273
You won't confess?

576
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,510
Then I must teach you a lesson.

577
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,751
Very wise. Give them a warning.

578
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,398
Fox!

579
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,875
I know it's you.

580
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,077
Give Governor Cheng 30 lashes!

581
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,110
Sir, it's an order. I can't help it.

582
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,519
Go ahead!

583
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,917
Enough! Enough!
I have an idea, sir, please...

584
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,433
Tell me, then.

585
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,989
Get lost!

586
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,072
Your Excellency, I hope
these documents are sufficient.

587
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,671
You're smart to come up with
this idea in such a short time.

588
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,228
Come here, come on.

589
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,799
Again, Your Excellency?

590
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,635
Sir...

591
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:31,918
It's a shame to see a smart guy
like you wasting away in this place.

592
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,274
Thank you, sir.

593
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,669
I'll deploy you to another province.

594
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,957
- Choose for yourself.
- Choose myself?

595
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,598
I'll choose a wealthy place.

596
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,839
I'm going to be rich!

597
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,591
It's worth being hit.

598
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,399
You return first
and organize my trip.

599
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,629
Yes, sir.

600
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,157
- Governor Cheng.
- Yes, sir.

601
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,920
Open the stores and donate the food
to the public. This will look good.

602
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,797
I'll report to the Emperor.

603
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,113
Thank you, sir.

604
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,714
Go on, open the stores
and hand out the food.

605
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,639
Hurry up.

606
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,755
Put the food on the cart.

607
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,591
Quickly, we must deliver it.

608
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,951
Next month, I'll be moving to Canton.
Would you give me some advice, sir?

609
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:29,315
As an officer you've observed four
righteous rules and four witty rules.

610
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,231
The four righteous rules are

611
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:36,792
to repay for merits,
to flatter, to liase and to ally.

612
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,149
Anyone who is skilled in applying
these rules will be prosperous.

613
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,197
And the four witty rules?

614
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,831
To create discord, to reprobate,
to frame and to set others up.

615
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,117
How wise you are.
You have my greatest respect.

616
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,157
You've already learnt how to flatter.

617
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,639
I didn't mean to.

618
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,479
Just remember
politics is like a dream.

619
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,552
Don't take it too seriously
and you'll be fine.

620
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,155
Then you'll live long and prosper.

621
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,633
Prepare the sedan chair
for His Excellency.

622
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,558
Chiretta, good for blood.

623
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,959
Ginseng for respiration.

624
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,952
Crocodile to cure catarrh.
Lizard to treat poisoning.

625
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,996
Tin-tsi... tin-tsi...

626
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,833
You fool! Don't hit me, Dad!

627
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,793
Dad.

628
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,428
Stick out your tongue.

629
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,358
Come on, stick out your tongue.

630
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,672
A slight fever.

631
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,357
Dr Yang isn't here.
I'll give you some medicine.

632
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,432
If the fever doesn't subside,
come and see Dr Yang.

633
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,078
Thank you, Miss Ho.

634
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,915
I've borrowed the pills
to raise money for my trip.

635
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,468
I must save my dad.
I'll repay you in the future.

636
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,035
Thank you.

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,752
Thank you for watching.

638
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,034
Ladies and gentlemen,

639
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,237
my father and I were separated
and I need money to get home.

640
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,630
I've no choice but to sell
our secret family life-saving pill.

641
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,755
30 cents each.

642
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,273
Little master, you helped us before,
now we'll help you.

643
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,078
Get lost!

644
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,118
Your dad hurt us before, kid.
Now it's our turn to hurt you.

645
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,077
Honest people don't do
sneaky things.

646
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,276
- I'm Wong Fei-hung. And you?
- Chiu Tin Pa.

647
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,998
Run Wong Fei-hung!

648
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,554
After him!

649
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,111
Make way!

650
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,149
You piece of shit!
Bullying a small boy.

651
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,475
You have no future.

652
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:26,160
Your mother would rather
have a bun than you.

653
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,912
- Nice moves. Well done!
- Thank you.

654
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,434
Watch out, hot water!

655
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,313
Watch out yourself!

656
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,516
You ruined my stuff.

657
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,919
You little bastard!

658
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,469
Turn around.

659
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,708
Give me that.

660
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,640
Boss, I'll pay for the damages.

661
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,358
- Enough?
- More than enough.

662
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:11,995
Too much.

663
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,876
How come my kung fu is so good?

664
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,274
Wong Fei-hung, you are great...

665
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,873
Do you take students?

666
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,838
I'm not qualified to teach you.
Put me down.

667
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,839
Shut up!

668
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,033
Who is Wong Fei-hung?

669
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,155
That's me.

670
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,559
That's him.

671
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,232
A dragon? A worm, more like!

672
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,833
Call someone bigger than you.

673
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,230
I'm this big. If you want me
to be bigger, wait a few years.

674
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,834
Challenge me?
I specialize in taming small kids.

675
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,148
You're so powerful.

676
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,391
If I catch you, you will suffer.

677
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,078
Come and get me. You can't keep up.

678
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,437
Let's go for a run.

679
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,679
You're like a lump of wood.
Can’t you keep up?

680
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,389
If I can't beat you, I'll retire.

681
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,313
I beat you. Retire.

682
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,716
He's really retired so quickly?

683
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,753
That was easy.

684
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,158
- Little worm.
- Crazy nut, another nasty show?

685
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,116
I've got thick skin.

686
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,876
- Stop talking to him.
- Shut up! He was lucky. Get lost.

687
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,153
Who hit me?

688
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,708
A stone.

689
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,998
Fei-hung, get up.

690
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:00,754
Come on.

691
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,558
Why did you sneak away?

692
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,790
I'm sorry, Auntie.
I wanted to find my dad.

693
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,269
I'll think of a way. Let's go.

694
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,399
"The Emperor's Royal Officers"

695
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,952
Welcome, Your Excellency.

696
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,679
Summon the Governor.

697
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,035
Summon the Governor!

698
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,799
Summon me?
Is the investigator back again?

699
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,871
Where does this monk come from?

700
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:01,748
You dare sit in my chair? Take him
away and close down the temple.

701
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,593
Why don’t you come to greet
the investigator?

702
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:06,558
You're the investigator?!

703
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,755
Another one.

704
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,274
This time I've got to see
your royal seal.

705
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,833
My rule is to kill
before investigating.

706
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,835
Is that another note
from Iron Monkey?

707
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,114
We've no money left.

708
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,350
He is the real one.

709
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,713
Your Excellency.

710
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,154
So you'll serve me now?

711
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,952
Yes, sir! Wash all the dishes
and prepare a banquet.

712
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,189
Yes, sir.

713
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,556
His Excellency would like
some chicken and shark fin.

714
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,636
Of course, of course.

715
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,639
The rod is blind,
it sweeps away all injustice.

716
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,554
Strong force
that switches north and south.

717
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,633
Fei-hung, your turn.

718
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,434
Seek the way.

719
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:05,949
Fisherman's Paddle!

720
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,439
Double Flight from the Sea!

721
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,473
Old Branches on the Ground!

722
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,039
Open Both Up and Down!

723
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,075
Rod that Calms the Central!

724
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,596
- Is he your first apprentice?
- You are the first.

725
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,477
He is your junior.

726
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,154
His dad will fight with you
sooner or later.

727
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,595
I really hope he doesn't come.

728
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,999
If you lose...

729
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,359
That's why I'm teaching him
how-to use the rod.

730
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,431
At least I get a follower.

731
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,077
Come on, Fei-hung.

732
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,469
Dad!

733
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,029
They should meet each other.

734
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,633
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

735
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,233
Still in one piece.

736
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,398
Dad, don't worry.
A man should be dignified.

737
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,755
Fei-hung hasn't made you lose face.

738
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,073
Good. I'm glad you've grown up.
My worries are over.

739
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,428
Thank you for saving my son Fei-hung.

740
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,635
My pleasure.

741
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:24,709
Please...

742
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,915
Help yourselves.

743
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,713
I heard there were some refugees
coming into town.

744
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,677
Iron Monkey will be around then.

745
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,956
Fei-hung, take this.

746
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,200
Fei-hung! No.

747
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,639
You can't eat roast duck,
you're ill. Let go.

748
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,673
From my diagnosis
he shouldn't eat so much.

749
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,512
You have it, Dr Yang.

750
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,273
You don't need a special diet
with my medicines.

751
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,114
It's better to be safe than sorry.

752
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,033
The Po Chi Lam Clinic prescription
is quite effective.

753
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,317
Fei-hung is still young, his stomach
is too weak to take such greasy food.

754
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,870
Brother Wong, you'd not put it
this way. But there is a basic law.

755
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:17,114
Since he's just recovered, he has no
appetite. This will give him one.

756
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,794
It doesn't matter what he eats,
as long as he does.

757
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,949
Not at all.

758
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,037
You'll never finish your meal
if you keep arguing.

759
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,075
I'm sorry.

760
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:36,077
"The Government House of Chekiang"

761
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:43,950
It's nice to be so relaxed about
things. You still have your women...

762
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,436
I'd love to be a monk like you.

763
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,799
What a waste of my talent.

764
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,750
Goodbye sweet ladies.

765
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,270
The dream has faded.

766
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,749
I must get some money
to buy an officer's post.

767
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,429
My last prayers, I can't believe
I have to bury you here.

768
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:21,159
Bless me
that I won't be tortured in future.

769
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,949
After I've buried you,
I'll have to sell myself.

770
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,477
Protect my future descendants from
such suffering as I've experienced.

771
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,917
You don't have to sell yourself.

772
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,719
Take this money
and bury your husband.

773
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,189
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

774
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,838
Dead monkey, I'll bury you!

775
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,429
It's a trap.

776
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,195
Right.

777
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,317
A rich city merchant hired us.

778
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,278
You'd better surrender,
Iron Monkey, or else.

779
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,070
You impostors!

780
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,073
I'll remove your mask.

781
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,913
You bastards.

782
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,275
You're even worse
than those greedy officers.

783
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,439
The Virgin's Sword Stance.

784
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,159
How can you call yourself a virgin?

785
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,556
You're so ugly,
you look more like a pig!

786
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,559
Lo Han's Double-Edged Sword!

787
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,873
You don't know one side of the sword
from the other!

788
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:08,349
Take your hands off!

789
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,199
Why don’t you leave?
You call yourselves martial artists?

790
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,471
You have to beat me too
before you leave.

791
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,832
Shaolin King Kong Palm.

792
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:51,148
Your kung fu is good. You even
recognize my Shaolin King Kong Palm.

793
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:53,388
It's nothing special.

794
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,552
Then try my Nothing Special move.

795
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,956
You can't escape from me.

796
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,355
Iron Monkey?

797
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,719
Shaolin Palm?

798
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,789
The Flying Monk?

799
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,195
Right, I'm the master
of the Flying Monk.

800
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,589
Monk, you rebelled against Shaolin.

801
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,274
It was you who burnt
the Shaolin Temple.

802
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:47,480
There are no rules. Human beings
die for fortune. Birds die for feed!

803
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,559
Preach to your dead colleagues.

804
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,354
How dare you challenge me.

805
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,908
- Tell me your name.
- Wong Kei-ying.

806
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:12,549
Wong Kei-ying, your kung fu
is like nothing I've seen before.

807
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,119
You're right.

808
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,995
No Shadow Kick, the Wong family move.

809
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,799
King Kong Palm!

810
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,394
You don't know when to give up.
I might as well finish you off!

811
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,278
Wind and Thunder King Kong Palm!

812
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,919
Lo Han Palm!

813
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,230
Once you've felt my King Kong Palm,
you've no chance of survival.

814
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,119
Are you OK?

815
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,192
Where are you hurt?

816
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,558
Get the needles for me.

817
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,114
I was hit by the King Kong Palm.

818
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:42,670
Release the poisoned blood first,
then give me the antidote.

819
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,958
Release the blood.

820
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,188
Take down the list of medicines now.

821
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,989
One centipede.

822
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,273
The tail of a scorpion.

823
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,112
The gall of a bear.

824
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,838
One viper.

825
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,238
One lizard...

826
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,836
Big brother, wake up!
Any other medicines?

827
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,672
Wake up.

828
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,159
Dr Yang!

829
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,518
Dad, are you OK?

830
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:45,115
Fei-hung, dad is hurt,
get Dr Yang now.

831
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,793
Who is he?

832
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,592
Iron Monkey?!

833
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,799
Dad!

834
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:08,269
- What are you doing, Fei-hung?
- Stop, Dad, he isn't Iron Monkey.

835
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,669
How dare you contradict your father.

836
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,915
Master Wong.

837
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,629
Is Dr Yang Iron Monkey?

838
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,869
Dad!

839
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,273
I just want to inspect
Dr Yang's wound.

840
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,839
Silly boy!

841
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,270
Miss Orchid, please get up.

842
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,636
King Kong Palm?!

843
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,674
Fight poison with poison.
It's a valuable treatment.

844
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,910
What an excellent doctor he is.

845
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,433
- Fei-hung, get a pen and ink ready.
- Yes, Dad.

846
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,514
There are no norms and no rules

847
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,239
You are trapped in a corner

848
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,390
There is nowhere to run

849
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,229
- Gold can't change
- Gold can't change

850
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,788
- Sad for blood
- Sad for blood

851
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:20,315
Release the blood
and revitalize the soul

852
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,516
Release the blood
and revitalize the soul

853
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,354
A curse that would put you to death

854
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,795
- Emergency aid
- Emergency aid

855
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:32,838
- One chance for life
- One chance for life

856
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:38,951
The only way out is death

857
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,035
Hurry up! Cure him.

858
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:50,709
Dad!

859
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,109
Iron Monkey and Wong Kei-ying
are both hurt.

860
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,034
Check all the clinics.
Arrest all those who are hurt!

861
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,553
Yes, sir!

862
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,557
Such medicines can cure
all sorts of illnesses.

863
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,756
Po Chi Lam Clinic
is really prestigious.

864
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,229
To cure poison
with poisonous insects.

865
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,156
The impact of your clinic on medicine
in the future will be enormous.

866
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,789
However, will you take me to court?

867
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,831
I can't right now,
but you will be arrested one day.

868
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,035
Take my advice and mend your ways.

869
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,114
My father was a righteous officer
when Wei Zhou was deposed.

870
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:35,193
His colleagues were greedy
and stole food.

871
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,271
My father was killed because of them.

872
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,909
How can the officers save others
when they can't even save themselves?

873
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,997
You can even buy an officer's post.

874
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,274
If there were fewer greedy officers
in the world,

875
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,750
we wouldn't need Iron Monkey.

876
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,158
- Who is it?
- Master Fox.

877
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,115
- Where is Dr Yang?
- He is out.

878
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,078
- Where is Wong Fei-hung?
- He's with Dr Yang.

879
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:09,798
Damn it!

880
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,914
The investigator wants them arrested.

881
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,399
Why?

882
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:18,712
Tell them to leave immediately.

883
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:24,509
Master Wong...

884
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:25,953
I heard.

885
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,512
I can't imagine
they're going to arrest me.

886
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:36,035
Dad, let's leave now.

887
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:42,070
Fei-hung, you can't follow me,
it's very dangerous.

888
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,472
Go back to Fushan by yourself.

889
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,590
If I don't return...

890
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,832
you take care of yourself.

891
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:52,558
Yes, Dad.

892
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:55,200
Fei-hung, a man
should be as strong as steel.

893
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:56,235
I understand.

894
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,629
A man should shed blood, not tears.

895
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,515
- Do you understand?
- Don't worry, Dad.

896
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:06,997
Dr Yang, please look after my dad.

897
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,554
If anything happens,
please let me know.

898
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,119
Of course.

899
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:19,590
Dad, don't worry about me.

900
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,475
Fei-hung, have you
forgotten my words already?

901
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,788
Don't cry!

902
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,632
Repeat what I said before.

903
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:41,475
A man should be as strong as steel.
A man should shed blood, not tears.

904
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:01,759
Master Wong,
I'll show you the back way out.

905
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:05,310
- We'll find a safe hiding place.
- Fine.

906
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,074
Dad.

907
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,519
Don't worry,
I'll take care of Fei-hung.

908
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,918
Fei-hung, go inside. I'll answer it.

909
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,719
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

910
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,994
Open up!

911
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,351
A girl! A pretty girl.

912
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,955
What do you want? Aren’t you monks
ashamed of yourselves?

913
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,113
A monk still needs pretty girls.

914
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,636
Let's enjoy ourselves.
Do you want our lives to be empty?

915
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,438
The Tum Ma move?!

916
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:10,791
She knows kung fu. There's something
strange about this clinic.

917
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,914
Stranger than you?

918
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,993
I'll show you!

919
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:48,954
Ether powder.

920
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,279
We got her.

921
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,670
Look at that face.
She's so attractive.

922
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,752
Let's listen to her screams.

923
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:11,671
We'll do our best to entertain you.
I guarantee a pleasant surprise.

924
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,873
We'll help ourselves.

925
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,988
See how nervous she is.
She must be very anxious.

926
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,110
Relax, this won't take long.

927
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,438
Go to hell you bastard monks!

928
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,077
Monks aren't monks,
officers aren't officers. Bullshit!

929
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:44,232
You little bastard,
do you want to die?

930
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,753
Auntie, leave now!

931
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,473
Do you want to go in?

932
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,788
Carry the Bow and Shoot the Moon!

933
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,109
Monkey's Rod!

934
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,637
Double Flight from the Sea!

935
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:04,312
Fisherman's Paddle!

936
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:06,868
What are you reciting?

937
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,393
Too many stances.

938
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,751
Don't let his stances put you off.

939
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:15,479
Rod that Sweeps Away all Injustice!

940
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,158
Very powerful.

941
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,956
Strong Force
that Switches North and South!

942
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,715
Don't let him recite. No more!

943
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,915
Over the Top...

944
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:28,349
Under the Earth!

945
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,793
Stop for a minute.

946
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,113
I don't think so.

947
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:33,474
Let's see you dance.

948
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:36,359
Left, right, left, right,
left, right. Halt!

949
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,394
Golden Snake Goes Into the Hole,
Golden Snake Comes Out of the Hole!

950
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,959
Back to the start.

951
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:10,548
Old witch!
Are you trying to scare the ghosts?

952
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:13,037
Then you can be a ghost.

953
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,908
No Shadow Kick!

954
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,669
Iron Monkey is Buddha.

955
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:52,638
The gold which he gave us
can't be spent frivolously.

956
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,280
If we spend it all
there won't be any more.

957
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:58,113
Dr Yang, Master Wong,
dinner is ready. Let's eat.

958
01:12:58,200 --> 01:12:59,269
Thank you.

959
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,351
There are only two bowls.
What about you?

960
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,158
We have a big abalone.

961
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,831
Don't lie to us.

962
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:08,593
We'll have the big abalone,
you take the rice.

963
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,956
Well, we'll share
these bowls of rice.

964
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,235
We've already eaten. Here.

965
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:16,878
I don't even like rice.

966
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,240
- We've eaten. Here.
- I don't like rice.

967
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,992
Miss Ho is here.

968
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,152
Big brother, Fei-hung's been arrested
by the soldiers.

969
01:13:25,240 --> 01:13:26,673
What?

970
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,273
What's wrong with you?

971
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:30,918
Orchid, Orchid!

972
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,437
It must be the monks. Orchid!

973
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,353
She seems to be suffering
from ether poisoning. Orchid!

974
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,508
Wake her up first.

975
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,430
Wong Fei-hung,
tell us where your father is.

976
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,877
Your dad is here.
Greet him now. Damn baldy!

977
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:11,836
Tough guy, I'll teach you
a lesson you won't forget.

978
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,753
Wait! If we kill him,
we'll never find Wong Kei-ying.

979
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,512
You're a traitor!

980
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:20,555
How dare you beat me,
the head of security!

981
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:30,318
Master Fox!

982
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,079
Master Fox!

983
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,638
Look out!

984
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,397
Hin Hung, let Wong Fei-hung go.

985
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:02,833
You're not the Iron Monkey I met.

986
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,433
Iron Monkey is Iron Monkey.

987
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,669
Hin Hung, prepare to meet your death!

988
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:21,473
Iron Monkey is here.

989
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,913
Catch Fei-hung!

990
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,512
The Flying Sleeves!

991
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,109
Come here!

992
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:42,268
Wong Kei-ying or Iron Monkey,
you still have to die!

993
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,873
Kill them both!

994
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:48,628
Go to hell!

995
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:51,034
See the Dart!

996
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,552
- You can't save him now.
- Have pity.

997
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,032
You've come to help.

998
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:05,998
You must all be in the same gang!

999
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,314
Call yourself a kung fu master?
You're useless!

1000
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:16,629
Don't block my way.

1001
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,313
Be gone!

1002
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,033
Take Fei-hung away.

1003
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,395
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

1004
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:32,155
Take him away.

1005
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,472
Flying Sleeves?
What happened to Shaolin Palm?

1006
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:46,636
You didn't die from my palm?
You're tough, huh?

1007
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:49,553
You are an investigator
yet you yourself are underhand.

1008
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:51,995
You are a disgrace
to your profession!

1009
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,593
Let's fight, then!

1010
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,595
Hurry up!

1011
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,348
Stay where you are!

1012
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,432
I'll be a laughing stock
if I let you bastards escape!

1013
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,517
Old traitor, let's see how many
stances you can resist.

1014
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,354
You joined forces with Iron Monkey
and brought shame on our school.

1015
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:50,829
You have no right
to call me a traitor.

1016
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,231
Stop pretending to be so righteous.
If it weren't for bastards like you,

1017
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,515
there wouldn't be
a need for Iron Monkey!

1018
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,038
Flying Sleeves!

1019
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,269
Come here!

1020
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,113
The Fifth Brother's Rod!

1021
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,119
Old traitor!

1022
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:50,235
Come on.

1023
01:18:54,120 --> 01:18:55,792
Shaolin King Kong Palm!

1024
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:57,836
- No Shadow Kick!
- Flying Leg!

1025
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:07,434
I'm coming! Damn you, baldy!

1026
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,116
Fei-hung, don't! It's too dangerous.

1027
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:23,593
Up the poles.

1028
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,956
Hey! It's burning. Get down.

1029
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,599
The fire is burning the poles.

1030
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:41,836
Dad! Iron Monkey! Run!

1031
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,435
Hin Hung, I can't defeat you on
the ground, but your balance is bad.

1032
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,876
- I'll beat you on the poles.
- Well, come on then.

1033
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:53,079
Let me take your place.

1034
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:57,229
Watch out!

1035
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:01,709
Off the poles.

1036
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,199
Not good enough.

1037
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:04,918
Attack the lower part. I'll go first.

1038
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,069
No Shadow Kick!

1039
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,395
Hit him!

1040
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,355
King Kong Falls!

1041
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,232
You're no better.

1042
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:32,719
Shaolin King Kong Palm!

1043
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:33,835
Iron Monkey, catch!

1044
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,717
Monkey Hangs on the Dried Tree!

1045
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,077
Push him down! The monk is losing.

1046
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,835
Not so easy!

1047
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,951
A Thousand Hand Move!

1048
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,713
Kick him off!

1049
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,755
Hit him!

1050
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,069
Fall down!

1051
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,068
It's hooked.

1052
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,276
When the wooden poles burn,
we'll have to fight in the fire.

1053
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,119
Down, dog!

1054
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,109
Stay where you are.
A return for you, monk!

1055
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,111
I'll sweep away all the poles.

1056
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,439
Iron Monkey, over here!

1057
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,758
There's only one pole left,
you're going to fall!

1058
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,354
It's going!

1059
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,915
Stand at the two ends.

1060
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,953
You can't stand properly.

1061
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:43,595
Don't worry about us.

1062
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,874
The pole under your feet
won't last much longer.

1063
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,791
You'll be buried in this sea of fire.

1064
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,470
Kick the pole and push me across.

1065
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,908
- The door is open.
- One pole to the sky.

1066
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,869
Monk, we tricked you.
One pole to the sea!

1067
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,596
You are totally wicked.
Down to the fire!

1068
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:30,992
- Hurry up! Throw the rod here.
- OK!

1069
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,519
Catch!

1070
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,629
Dad.

1071
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,673
I'm fine.

1072
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,957
I thought
I was never going to see you again.

1073
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,395
Why doesn't anybody care about me?

1074
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,994
Don't just stand there, leave now.

1075
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,195
Go!

1076
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,836
"Train Station"

1077
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:18,119
Master Wong,
who knows when we'll meet again?

1078
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,555
Dr Yang, Miss Ho, why don’t you come
to Fushan to visit us?

1079
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,868
Auntie, you must come.

1080
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,598
Master Wong, I'm sorry I'm late.

1081
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,319
Ah, you've come to see us off
though you're so busy.

1082
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,710
Don't mention it.
I'm busy catching Iron Monkey.

1083
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,518
Another new officer is coming.

1084
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,397
I hope he is a good one.

1085
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:44,111
Well, we must say goodbye.
Fei-hung, let's go.

1086
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,435
Take care.

1087
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,918
