1
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:06,302
Now, we come here not as conquerors...

2
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:12,066
...but as liberators, to return
control of this city to the people.

3
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:17,989
And at the first sign of interference
from the outside world...

4
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:22,489
...or from those people
attempting to flee...

5
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:27,031
...this anonymous Gothamite...

6
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:32,078
...this unsung hero,
will trigger the bomb.

7
00:00:34,496 --> 00:00:36,874
<i>For now, martial law is in effect.</i>

8
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:42,384
Return to your homes,
hold your families close...

9
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,094
...and wait.

10
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:49,265
Tomorrow, you claim what
is rightfully yours.

11
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,186
Pull back the fighters.

12
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,614
Start high-level
reconnaissance flights.

13
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:03,363
Get the president on the line.

14
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,510
MERCENARY 1: Tanks and planes cannot
stop us from detonating our device.

15
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:34,269
Send an emissary to discuss terms of
access for supplies and communication.

16
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:41,238
How many of you are there, son?

17
00:01:42,856 --> 00:01:46,656
You don't have enough men to stop 12
million people from leaving this island.

18
00:01:47,444 --> 00:01:49,867
No. No, we don't.

19
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,077
But you do.

20
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:56,079
Now, why the hell would I try
to help you keep your hostages?

21
00:01:56,245 --> 00:01:59,249
If one person crosses
this bridge...

22
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,213
...Gotham gets blown to hell.

23
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,930
<i>The people of our greatest
city are resilient.</i>

24
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,559
<i>They have proven this before,
and they will prove it again.</i>

25
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:19,519
<i>We do not negotiate with
terrorists...</i>

26
00:02:20,394 --> 00:02:22,237
<i>...but we do recognize realities.</i>

27
00:02:23,313 --> 00:02:25,441
<i>As this situation develops...</i>

28
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:29,115
<i>...one thing must be understood
above all others.</i>

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,204
<i>People of Gotham, we have not abandoned you.</i>

30
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,709
What does that mean?

31
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:38,624
It means we're on our own.

32
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:40,839
I have to get in front of a camera.

33
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,543
They will kill you the
second you show your face.

34
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:48,173
Bane says he's giving Gotham back to the
people. They need to know I could lead.

35
00:02:48,338 --> 00:02:49,931
Bane's not gonna let that happen.

36
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,637
Then he'll show his true colors.

37
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,427
And you'll be dead.

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,167
Behind you stands a
symbol of oppression.

39
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:19,252
Blackgate Prison...

40
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:23,006
...where a thousand
men have languished...

41
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,929
Harvey Dent.

42
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:32,265
Who has been held up to you...

43
00:03:32,424 --> 00:03:36,930
<i>...as the shining example
of justice!</i>

44
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:40,099
We're just gonna keep moving you till
we can get you in front of the camera.

45
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:44,236
You have been supplied with
a false idol to stop you...

46
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:46,817
...tearing down this corrupt city!

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,607
Yes! Yes! Yes!

48
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:52,404
Let me tell you the
truth about Harvey Dent.

49
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:57,416
From the words of Gotham's
police commissioner...

50
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:59,952
<i>on:</i>

51
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,881
<i>The Batman didn't murder
Harvey Dent</i>

52
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,962
<i>He saved my boy...</i>

53
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:10,592
<i>...then took the blame for
Harvey's appalling crimes...</i>

54
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:13,382
...so that I could, to my shame...

55
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,179
<i>...build a lie around this...</i>

56
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,063
...fallen idol.

57
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:27,276
<i>I praised the madman who tried
to murder my own child.</i>

58
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,234
Well, I can no longer
live with my lie.

59
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,155
It is time to trust the people
of Gotham with the truth...

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,416
...and it is time
for me to resign."

61
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,712
And do you accept this
man's resignation?

62
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:49,718
And do you accept the resignation
of all of these liars?

63
00:04:49,876 --> 00:04:51,549
Of all the corrupt?

64
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,593
<i>KE: Those men locked up for eight
years in Blackgate...</i>

65
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,014
...and denied parole under the Dent Act,
it was based on a lie.

66
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,683
Gotham needed a hero.

67
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,071
Well, it needs it now more than ever,
but you betrayed everything you stood for.

68
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:16,659
There's a point far out there
when the structures fail you...

69
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,699
...when the rules aren't
weapons anymore...

70
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,877
...they're shackles,
letting the bad guy get ahead.

71
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:28,962
One day, you may face...

72
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,797
...such a moment of crisis.

73
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,259
And in that moment, I hope you
have a friend like I did...

74
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:40,098
...to plunge their hands into the filth,
so that you can keep yours clean!

75
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,311
Your hands look plenty
filthy to me, commissioner.

76
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:49,436
We take Gotham from the corrupt!

77
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,822
The rich!

78
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:55,700
The oppressors of generations...

79
00:05:55,859 --> 00:06:00,035
...who have kept you down
with myths of opportunity.

80
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:03,246
And we give it back to you...

81
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:06,086
...the people.

82
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:09,085
Gotham is yours!

83
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:12,884
None shall interfere.
Do as you please.

84
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:18,632
But start by storming Blackgate
and freeing the oppressed!

85
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,517
Open it!

86
00:06:28,433 --> 00:06:31,482
Step forward,
those who would serve...

87
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,815
...for an army will be raised.

88
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,666
The powerful will be ripped
from their decadent nests...

89
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:53,877
...and cast out into the cold
world that we know and endure!

90
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:00,557
Courts will be convened.

91
00:07:08,223 --> 00:07:10,521
Spoils will be enjoyed.

92
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,940
Blood will be shed!

93
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:22,951
The police will survive...

94
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:27,539
<i>as they learn to serve true justice</i>

95
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,163
This great city...

96
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,833
...it will endure.

97
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:41,299
<i>Gotham will survive!</i>

98
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,534
He says you must
first fix your back.

99
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:06,907
How does he know?

100
00:08:07,073 --> 00:08:08,495
He was the prison doctor.

101
00:08:08,658 --> 00:08:12,538
He's a morphine addict who
incurred the displeasure...

102
00:08:12,704 --> 00:08:16,629
...of powerful people,
including your masked friend.

103
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:19,044
How?

104
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:24,596
Many years ago,
it was a time of plague.

105
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:29,271
Some of the other
prisoners attacked Bane.

106
00:08:31,306 --> 00:08:34,981
<i>The doctor's fumbling attempts
to repair the damage...</i>

107
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:37,396
...left him in perpetual agony.

108
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:40,736
The mask holds the pain at bay.

109
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,244
Bane was the child you spoke of?

110
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:45,699
He was born here?

111
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:51,126
The legend is that there was a mercenary
who worked for a local warlord.

112
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:54,212
<i>He fell in love with the warlord's daughter.</i>

113
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:56,297
<i>They were married in secret.</i>

114
00:08:56,456 --> 00:08:58,458
When the warlord found out...

115
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,805
...the mercenary was
condemned to this pit.

116
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,633
But then he exiled him instead.

117
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,849
<i>The mercenary understood that it was the
daughter who had secured his release.</i>

118
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:14,892
<i>But what he could not know was the
true price of his freedom.</i>

119
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,732
She took his place in the pit.

120
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:22,403
And she was with child...

121
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,489
<i>...the mercenary's child.</i>

122
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,290
Innocence cannot flower underground.
It has to be stamped out.

123
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:38,882
One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell.

124
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,974
<i>But the child had a friend...</i>

125
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:53,898
<i>...a protector who showed the others that
this innocence was their redemption.</i>

126
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:55,773
<i>It was to be prized.</i>

127
00:09:55,932 --> 00:09:57,684
The mother was not so lucky.

128
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:04,529
This is Bane's prison now.
He wouldn't want this story told.

129
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:19,632
There's a vertebra
protruding from your back.

130
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:22,092
It has to be put back.

131
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,887
Stay like this until you stand.

132
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:42,814
RA'S AL GHUL: Tsk, tsk, tsk. Did you
not think I would return, Bruce? Hmm?

133
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:50,112
I told you I was immortal.

134
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,784
I watched-- I watched you die.

135
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,920
Oh, there are many
forms of immortality.

136
00:10:59,829 --> 00:11:01,297
Once, I had a wife...

137
00:11:02,832 --> 00:11:04,550
...my great love.

138
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,298
- She was taken from me.
- You were the mercenary.

139
00:11:13,343 --> 00:11:15,311
Bane is your child.

140
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,977
Your heir.

141
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:20,892
An heir to ensure the League
of Shadows fulfills its duty...

142
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,687
...to restore balance
to civilization.

143
00:11:23,853 --> 00:11:24,900
No.

144
00:11:25,063 --> 00:11:28,488
You yourself fought the
decadence of Gotham for years...

145
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,573
...with all your strength...

146
00:11:30,944 --> 00:11:35,165
...all your resources,
all your moral authority.

147
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:38,911
And the only victory you
could achieve was a lie.

148
00:11:39,536 --> 00:11:42,415
Now you understand. Gotham is beyond saving.

149
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,706
No.

150
00:11:43,873 --> 00:11:46,001
- And must be allowed to die.
- No!

151
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:54,926
Yeah, just lift your head.

152
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:56,765
Oh, that's good.

153
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,647
No, no!

154
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:41,356
- What's that?
- This was someone's home.

155
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,437
And now it's everyone's home.

156
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:48,275
There's a storm coming,
remember? This is what you wanted.

157
00:13:17,383 --> 00:13:20,182
It's for the bus, in case
there's a chance to evacuate.

158
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:21,892
Any news? ls the commissioner--?

159
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:25,400
The less you know, Father.
How are the boys doing?

160
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:28,357
Well, we've had more power on,
so they've got some TV.

161
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,863
It's good to see you.

162
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:34,613
Blake, you be careful out there.
They're hunting down cops like dogs.

163
00:13:40,323 --> 00:13:41,620
Why build yourself?

164
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:48,924
- I'm not meant to die in here.
- Here, there. What's the difference?

165
00:14:50,643 --> 00:14:53,988
I told you it could not be done.

166
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:55,774
You told me a child did it.

167
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,448
But no ordinary child.

168
00:14:59,611 --> 00:15:02,410
<i>A child born in hell.</i>

169
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,211
<i>Forged from suffering.</i>

170
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,628
<i>Hardened by pain.</i>

171
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,795
Not a man from privilege.

172
00:15:35,855 --> 00:15:37,823
We got boots on the ground, sir.

173
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:39,700
Just waiting on intel.

174
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:46,453
You have ID?

175
00:15:47,158 --> 00:15:48,205
Of course not.

176
00:15:48,368 --> 00:15:50,917
- Well, how can we trust you?
- We don't have any choice.

177
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,132
Commissioner Gordon.
Captain Jones, Special Forces.

178
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,837
Captain. Glad to have you here.

179
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,674
It's our job, sir.
Now, uh, how many of you are there?

180
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:01,760
Well, there's dozens.
I'd rather not say exactly.

181
00:16:01,923 --> 00:16:05,177
But the men trapped underground
number almost 3000.

182
00:16:05,343 --> 00:16:07,266
<i- >- - ES: Condition?
Getting food and water.</i>

183
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:09,726
- Can we break them out?
- Yes, sir.

184
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:12,233
Take out the mercenaries
south of Ackerman Park.

185
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:15,111
<i>Blow the rubble, make a hole big
enough for 10 at a time.</i>

186
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,490
I'm in contact with my partner who's
down there. They're just waiting.

187
00:16:18,648 --> 00:16:22,903
- Men who haven't seen daylight in months?
- Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.

188
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:25,743
What about the bomb? Satellite
can't pick up radiation hot spots.

189
00:16:26,281 --> 00:16:29,660
<i>ON: They keep it on a truck.
It must have a lead-lined roof.</i>

190
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:32,500
<i- >- - They move it constantly.
Good. So you know the truck?</i>

191
00:16:32,662 --> 00:16:36,007
<i>ON: Well, it's one of three.
We've been tracking it.</i>

192
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:37,421
Decoy.

193
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,385
- You don't really think he's coming back?
- Doesn't matter what I think.

194
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:46,427
Actually, it does. You should put your
faith in something a little more real.

195
00:16:46,592 --> 00:16:49,812
<i- >- - ON: The routes don't vary much.
Okay. What about the triggerman?</i>

196
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:54,021
No leads. It's a bluff. Bane wouldn't
give control of that bomb to someone else.

197
00:16:54,183 --> 00:16:58,404
We can't take that chance. Until we have
the triggerman, we just track the device.

198
00:16:58,563 --> 00:17:02,488
And meanwhile, Gotham lives under a warlord,
like some failed state?

199
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,529
Dial it back, officer.
This situation is unprecedented.

200
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:10,952
- We can't do anything to risk millions of lives.
- You gonna tell him what's really going on?

201
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:14,212
Captain, the situation is more
complicated than you think.

202
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:16,589
<i>There's someone you need to meet.</i>

203
00:17:16,914 --> 00:17:20,794
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.
Found the people who run the corporation.

204
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,132
What corporation?

205
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:24,673
Wayne Enterprises. You good?

206
00:17:33,723 --> 00:17:35,896
Mr. Fox, would you like
to brief the captain?

207
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,694
Miss Tate's fully aware
of the situation.

208
00:17:38,853 --> 00:17:43,324
And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises,
I have to take responsibility for it.

209
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,485
- Why?
- We built it.

210
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,153
You built the bomb?

211
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,496
It was built as a fusion reactor.
First of its kind.

212
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:55,036
Bane turned the core into a bomb
and removed it from the reactor.

213
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:58,582
- Here's the important part.
- As the device's fuel cells deteriorate...

214
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,671
...it becomes
increasingly unstable...

215
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,380
...to the point of detonation.

216
00:18:02,543 --> 00:18:04,295
This bomb is a time bomb.

217
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:08,467
And it will go off in 23 days,
regardless of Bane's revolution...

218
00:18:08,633 --> 00:18:11,352
...or what we, or the
outside world, choose to do.

219
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:14,105
So your plan might not be
as practical as you thought.

220
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:19,110
- Could you disarm it?
- I could reconnect it to the reactor. Stabilize it.

221
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:22,397
- Let's move from this location and call it in.
- Right. Let's go.

222
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:25,783
No, no, we'll take it from here.
You stay and look after these folks.

223
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:34,368
Someone sold us out.

224
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,461
Go, go, go!

225
00:18:58,766 --> 00:19:00,860
I'll die before I talk.

226
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:03,814
I'm on your schedule, captain.

227
00:19:10,278 --> 00:19:12,622
There were people living upstairs.

228
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,242
Round them up for judgment...

229
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:23,959
...and hang them where
the world can see.

230
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:30,803
<i>ER: Police have cordoned off
the entire Central Heights and
East Park Side areas...</i>

231
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:35,061
<i>...as well as Merchant and South Shoreline
Boulevards in an attempt--</i>

232
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,731
He says the leap to freedom
is not about strength.

233
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:45,154
My body makes the jump.

234
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:49,526
Survival is the spirit. The soul.

235
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:55,415
My soul is as ready
to escape as my body.

236
00:19:55,573 --> 00:19:58,577
Fear is why you fail.

237
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:00,415
No, I'm not afraid.

238
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,581
I'm angry

239
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:34,286
Bruce.

240
00:20:35,488 --> 00:20:36,580
Why do we fall?

241
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,497
You do not fear death.

242
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,091
You think this makes you strong.
It makes you weak.

243
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:51,675
Why?

244
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:54,090
How can you move
faster than possible...

245
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:56,851
...fight longer than possible...

246
00:20:57,134 --> 00:21:00,729
...without the most powerful
impulse of the spirit?

247
00:21:01,973 --> 00:21:03,600
The fear of death.

248
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:06,185
I do fear death.

249
00:21:07,979 --> 00:21:09,947
I fear dying in here...

250
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:12,654
...while my city burns.

251
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:15,616
There's no one there to save it.

252
00:21:16,988 --> 00:21:18,490
Then make the climb.

253
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,879
How?

254
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:28,170
As the child did...

255
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:34,551
...without the rope.

256
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:39,514
Then fear will find you again.

257
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,770
Ah, supplies for your journey?

258
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:51,030
Oh, that's wonderful. That's...

259
00:21:55,568 --> 00:21:57,195
What does that mean?

260
00:21:57,737 --> 00:21:58,989
Rise.

261
00:22:00,323 --> 00:22:01,370
No.

262
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,253
No, there's been a mistake!

263
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:35,418
Take me to Bane!

264
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,676
I want to see Bane!

265
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:44,017
Order!

266
00:23:44,176 --> 00:23:46,929
This is a mistake! Where is Bane?

267
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:49,224
There's been no mistake,
Mr. Stryver.

268
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:52,021
You are Philip Stryver...

269
00:23:52,184 --> 00:23:55,688
...executive vice president
of Daggett Industries...

270
00:23:55,855 --> 00:23:59,485
...who for years has been living
off the blood and sweat...

271
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,869
...of people less
powerful than him.

272
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:05,122
Call Bane. I am one of you.

273
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:08,914
Bane has no authority here.
This is merely a sentencing hearing.

274
00:24:09,076 --> 00:24:11,204
Now, the choice is yours.

275
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,793
Exile or death!

276
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,841
Order!

277
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,718
Exi-- Exile.

278
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:23,887
Sold.

279
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:25,801
To the man in the cold sweat.

280
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:34,606
You follow the thick ice.

281
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:36,897
You try to swim,
you're dead in minutes.

282
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,655
Has anyone made it?

283
00:24:52,077 --> 00:24:54,500
<i>ON: Where are they? It's not like
we have a lot of time.</i>

284
00:24:54,955 --> 00:24:56,081
How long?

285
00:24:56,248 --> 00:24:58,091
The bomb goes off tomorrow.

286
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:01,505
- We have about 18 hours to do something.
- To do what?

287
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,675
To mark the truck. Get a GPS on it so we can
start to figure out how to bring it down.

288
00:25:12,389 --> 00:25:13,641
That's it?

289
00:25:16,143 --> 00:25:17,235
Foley.

290
00:25:18,771 --> 00:25:22,696
- Where's Foley, damn it?
- You shouldn't be out on the streets.

291
00:25:27,404 --> 00:25:30,328
- Jim, he's not here.
- You let your wife come to the door?

292
00:25:30,491 --> 00:25:33,540
- When the city's under occupation?
- Wait in the kitchen, honey.

293
00:25:33,702 --> 00:25:36,330
What did you do, bury your
uniform in the backyard?

294
00:25:36,497 --> 00:25:38,625
You saw what they did
to those Special Forces.

295
00:25:38,791 --> 00:25:41,135
Have you forgotten all the
years we were out on patrol?

296
00:25:41,293 --> 00:25:44,422
When every gangbanger wanted to plant
one as soon as our backs were turned?

297
00:25:44,588 --> 00:25:48,718
That was different. These guys run the city.
The government's done a deal with them.

298
00:25:48,884 --> 00:25:51,433
Bane's got their balls in a vice.
That's not a deal.

299
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,895
You move on Bane, the triggerman
is gonna hit the button.

300
00:25:55,057 --> 00:25:59,028
You think he's given control of
that bomb to one of the people?

301
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:01,188
You think this is part
of some revolution?

302
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:04,199
There's one man with his finger
on the button. That's Bane.

303
00:26:04,358 --> 00:26:07,453
Look, we've all got to keep our
heads down till they can fix this.

304
00:26:07,611 --> 00:26:11,241
- If you still had a family here--
- This only gets fixed from inside...

305
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,000
...the city!

306
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:14,998
Look, Peter.

307
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:20,550
I'm not asking you to walk down Grand in your
dress blues, but something has to be done.

308
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:22,756
- Sorry, Jim. I gotta--
- Keep your head down?

309
00:26:22,918 --> 00:26:25,091
What good's that gonna
do when that thing blows?

310
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:27,723
You don't know that's gonna happen.

311
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:34,184
I hear you're looking for men, commissioner.

312
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:35,598
How about me instead?

313
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:38,358
Miss Tate, I, uh,
can't ask you to do that.

314
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,357
Please.

315
00:26:41,937 --> 00:26:44,110
You little punk! What'd you take?

316
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,571
Nothing! I didn't take anything!

317
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:50,034
You steal from us,
you little bastard?

318
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:54,618
Now, you boys know you can't come into
my neighborhood without asking politely.

319
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:03,793
Never steal anything from
someone you can't outrun, kid.

320
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:12,514
You're pretty generous for a thief.

321
00:27:21,185 --> 00:27:23,938
- I thought they killed you.
- Not yet.

322
00:27:24,271 --> 00:27:27,445
- If you're expecting an apology, I--
- it wouldn't suit you.

323
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:29,906
I need your help.

324
00:27:30,444 --> 00:27:31,912
And why would I help you?

325
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:34,073
For this. Clean slate.

326
00:27:34,239 --> 00:27:36,241
You'd trust me with that?

327
00:27:36,825 --> 00:27:38,452
After what I did to you?

328
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,543
I'll admit, I was a little letdown.

329
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:46,294
But I still think there's more to you.
In fact, I think that for you...

330
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,053
...this isn't just a tool.

331
00:27:48,212 --> 00:27:51,432
It's an escape route.
You want to disappear. Start fresh.

332
00:27:52,341 --> 00:27:55,311
- I can't even get off this island.
- I can give you a way off...

333
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:57,016
...once you get me to Lucius Fox.

334
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,978
Find out where they're
holding him and take me in.

335
00:28:03,727 --> 00:28:04,819
Why do you need Fox?

336
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:07,482
- To save the city.
- Who says it needs saving?

337
00:28:07,648 --> 00:28:09,241
Maybe I like it this way.

338
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,027
Maybe you do...

339
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:14,747
...but tomorrow that
bomb's going off.

340
00:28:17,324 --> 00:28:19,042
Got your powerful
friend on the case?

341
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:20,544
I'm trying

342
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,997
...but I need Fox.

343
00:28:23,163 --> 00:28:24,915
As it approaches...

344
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:26,880
...flip the switch.

345
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:30,592
The needle hits 200, you give me the signal,
I'll mark the truck. Okay?

346
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:33,591
Heads up, heads up.

347
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,988
- I got it.
- Mercenaries on your 6.

348
00:28:52,151 --> 00:28:55,280
Stand still! Keep your hands
where we can see them!

349
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:59,537
Commissioner Gordon, you are under arrest.

350
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,418
On whose authority?

351
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:02,794
The people of Gotham.

352
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:08,714
<i>No lawyer? No witnesses?
What sort of due process is this?</i>

353
00:29:08,876 --> 00:29:12,096
Your guilt has been determined,
this is merely a sentencing hearing.

354
00:29:12,504 --> 00:29:14,097
Now, what will it be?

355
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,018
Death or exile?

356
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:22,933
Crane, if you think we're going
out onto that ice willingly...

357
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:24,691
...you have another thing coming.

358
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:28,529
Death, then.

359
00:29:28,687 --> 00:29:30,906
- Looks that way.
- Very well.

360
00:29:31,065 --> 00:29:32,567
Death...

361
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:35,619
...by exile.

362
00:29:38,197 --> 00:29:39,665
Bring her to me.

363
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:50,384
Hey, we're going now. Blake says
they're ready! Get your gear on!

364
00:29:50,542 --> 00:29:53,591
Hey, you hear me? We're going now.
Let's do it.

365
00:29:57,716 --> 00:29:59,969
MERCENARY 1: Find this one a spot,
got a big day tomorrow.

366
00:30:00,135 --> 00:30:03,309
MERCENARY 2: We all do.
It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.

367
00:30:05,557 --> 00:30:06,934
- Bruce.
- You okay?

368
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:09,479
Picked a hell of a time to
go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.

369
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:11,318
How long until that core ignites?

370
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,326
- That bomb goes off in 12 hours.
- Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.

371
00:30:16,068 --> 00:30:19,197
- Can you get Miranda out of here?
- Not tonight. I'm sorry.

372
00:30:19,988 --> 00:30:22,241
- Do what's necessary.
- Tonight I need you.

373
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:24,830
- What for?
- To get me back in the game.

374
00:30:24,993 --> 00:30:29,169
Sorry to spoil things, boys,
but Bane wants these guys to himself.

375
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,595
- I won't forget about you, Miranda.
- I know.

376
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,685
I like your girlfriend, Mr. Wayne.

377
00:30:45,848 --> 00:30:47,691
He should be so lucky.

378
00:30:53,438 --> 00:30:56,191
Any move I make on
Bane or the bomb...

379
00:30:56,358 --> 00:30:58,235
...the triggerman sets it off.

380
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:01,201
Well, they won't use radio or cell.
Too much interference.

381
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:03,036
Infrared doesn't have the range.

382
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:05,951
It'll have to be a
microburst. Longwave.

383
00:31:06,118 --> 00:31:07,916
- Could you block it?
- Yes.

384
00:31:08,078 --> 00:31:11,708
But I'll need the EMP cannon
guidance mount from the Bat.

385
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,502
Remember where you parked?

386
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:30,359
She ï¬,y okay?

387
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:34,112
Yeah, even without the autopilot.

388
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,241
- Thanks.
- Autopilot? That's what you're there for.

389
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,779
Okay. It's clear.
Come on, quick. One at a time.

390
00:32:23,695 --> 00:32:25,038
Wait, wait!

391
00:32:26,365 --> 00:32:27,833
<i>2: Ross!</i>

392
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,368
Ross?

393
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:32,087
Lock it up. COP 3: No, keep down.

394
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:34,339
Get down!

395
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,210
Who are you?

396
00:33:06,613 --> 00:33:07,910
Light it up.

397
00:33:25,882 --> 00:33:29,056
Dad, check it out. MRS.
FOLEY: Honey, come take a look.

398
00:33:39,438 --> 00:33:41,156
Impossible.

399
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,692
Keep her close.

400
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:46,032
He'll come for her.

401
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:48,113
Where's Miranda Tate?

402
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,248
Bane took her.

403
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:53,749
He's holed up at city hall,
surrounded by his army.

404
00:33:54,036 --> 00:33:56,539
This blocks the remote
detonator signal to the bomb.

405
00:33:56,705 --> 00:34:00,380
Get it onto it before sunrise.
They might hit the button when it starts.

406
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:02,465
When what starts?

407
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:04,178
War.

408
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,166
You missed a spot.

409
00:34:44,753 --> 00:34:49,634
- If you're working alone, wear a mask.
- I'm not afraid to be seen standing up to them.

410
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,020
The mask is not for you.
It's to protect the people you care about.

411
00:34:54,721 --> 00:34:56,689
Count to five, then throw.

412
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:09,741
No offense, but you got
something bigger in that belt?

413
00:35:20,163 --> 00:35:23,292
- What now?
- All-out assault on Bane.

414
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:25,711
But you need to get
people across the bridge.

415
00:35:25,877 --> 00:35:28,130
- Why?
- In case we fail.

416
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:31,015
Lead an exodus.
Save as many lives as you can.

417
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,471
You don't need me here?

418
00:35:32,634 --> 00:35:34,181
You've given me an army.

419
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,516
Now go.

420
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,355
Hey, thanks.

421
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:38,857
Don't thank me yet.

422
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:41,063
Well, I might not
get a chance later.

423
00:35:54,906 --> 00:35:56,624
You shouldn't have.

424
00:35:57,576 --> 00:35:59,749
The midtown tunnel's blocked by debris...

425
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,290
...but the cannons have enough
firepower to make a path for people.

426
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:05,300
Wait until the fighting begins.

427
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:08,178
You're gonna wage a war to
save your stuck-up girlfriend?

428
00:36:08,336 --> 00:36:09,383
To start it, throttle--

429
00:36:11,173 --> 00:36:14,347
- I got it.
- We have 45 minutes to save this city.

430
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:17,262
No, I've got 45 minutes to get
clear of the blast radius.

431
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:20,729
- You don't stand a chance against these guys.
- With your help, I might.

432
00:36:20,891 --> 00:36:23,269
I'll open that tunnel,
then I'm gone.

433
00:36:24,352 --> 00:36:25,945
There's more to you than that.

434
00:36:29,608 --> 00:36:31,702
Sorry to keep letting you down.

435
00:36:35,363 --> 00:36:36,910
Come with me.

436
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,793
Save yourself.

437
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,756
You don't owe these
people any more.

438
00:36:44,915 --> 00:36:47,043
You've given them everything.

439
00:36:47,209 --> 00:36:48,677
Not everything.

440
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:50,337
Not yet.

441
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:32,050
MERCENARY Disperse!

442
00:37:32,212 --> 00:37:34,431
Disperse or be fired upon!

443
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,218
There's only one
police in this town.

444
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:18,888
Open fire.

445
00:39:10,101 --> 00:39:11,819
- Here it comes!
- Get ready!

446
00:39:41,675 --> 00:39:45,771
So you came back to
die with your city.

447
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:49,896
No. I came back to stop you.

448
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:01,991
NOW!

449
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,543
That's impossible.

450
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,047
Cut over to Fifth!

451
00:40:34,102 --> 00:40:36,104
Here you go.
Get on the bus. Go ahead.

452
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:38,865
You, come with me. You too.

453
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:42,114
Hey, you, you, and you,
come here, come here.

454
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:44,120
Everyone else get on the bus, okay?

455
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:46,953
You guys, you go knock on doors
and spread the word, okay?

456
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:50,995
The bomb is gonna go off. Get out by the
South Street tunnel or over the bridge.

457
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:53,880
You do two blocks and you get
back to the bus, all right?

458
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:55,915
Go, go, go!

459
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:57,459
Is he back?

460
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:00,178
Keep your eyes open. Go, go.

461
00:42:22,794 --> 00:42:24,341
Cover the doors!

462
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:29,054
Where's your trigger?!

463
00:42:29,384 --> 00:42:31,011
Where is it?!

464
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:34,772
You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen!

465
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,559
Where is it? Where's your trigger?

466
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:41,654
Where is it?! Where is it?!

467
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:51,573
Tell me where the trigger is.

468
00:42:52,073 --> 00:42:55,668
Then you have my permission to die.

469
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:09,515
I broke you.

470
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,677
How have you come back?

471
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:17,350
You think you're the only one who
could learn the strength to escape?

472
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:18,812
Where's the trigger?

473
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:21,819
But I never escaped.

474
00:43:22,687 --> 00:43:24,234
But the child.

475
00:43:26,024 --> 00:43:28,072
The child of Ra's Al
Ghul made the climb.

476
00:43:28,234 --> 00:43:30,612
But he's not the child
of Ra's Al Ghul.

477
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:35,875
<i>I am.</i>

478
00:43:36,326 --> 00:43:38,749
And though I'm not ordinary...

479
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:41,797
...I am a citizen.

480
00:44:01,392 --> 00:44:02,564
Miranda?

481
00:44:05,438 --> 00:44:06,485
Why?

482
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:08,574
Talia.

483
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,449
My mother named me Talia,
before she was killed...

484
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,704
...the way I would have been killed,
if not for my protector...

485
00:44:17,158 --> 00:44:18,205
<i>...Bane.</i>

486
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:27,339
Goodbye.

487
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:31,715
I climbed out of the pit.

488
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:39,477
<i>I found my father...</i>

489
00:44:42,433 --> 00:44:45,562
...and brought him back to
exact terrible vengeance.

490
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:48,189
<i>But by that time...</i>

491
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:53,070
...the prisoners and doctor had
done their work to my friend.

492
00:44:53,236 --> 00:44:54,453
<i>My protector.</i>

493
00:44:58,449 --> 00:44:59,951
<i>The League took us in.</i>

494
00:45:00,326 --> 00:45:01,873
Trained us.

495
00:45:02,245 --> 00:45:05,044
But my father could
not accept Bane.

496
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:07,333
<i>He saw only a monster.</i>

497
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,382
His very existence was a reminder of
the hell he'd left his wife to die in.

498
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,927
He excommunicated Bane
from the League of Shadows.

499
00:45:17,093 --> 00:45:21,644
His only crime was
that he loved me.

500
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:26,357
I could not forgive my father.

501
00:45:30,982 --> 00:45:32,655
Until you murdered him.

502
00:45:50,501 --> 00:45:55,974
He was trying to kill
millions of innocent people.

503
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:59,887
Innocent is a strong word to
throw around Gotham, Bruce.

504
00:46:02,513 --> 00:46:05,562
I honor my father by
finishing his work.

505
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:22,618
Vengeance against the man who killed
him is simply a reward for my patience.

506
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:25,210
You see...

507
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:28,089
...it's the slow knife...

508
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,875
...the knife that takes its time.

509
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,887
The knife...

510
00:46:36,714 --> 00:46:40,309
...that waits years
without forgetting...

511
00:46:40,593 --> 00:46:43,893
...then slips quietly
between the bones.

512
00:46:44,931 --> 00:46:46,228
That's the knife...

513
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:48,901
...that cuts deepest.

514
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,186
Please.

515
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,904
Maybe your knife...

516
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:02,327
...was too slow.

517
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:03,912
The truck is under attack.

518
00:47:04,075 --> 00:47:07,830
Gordon. You gave him a
way to block my signal.

519
00:47:07,995 --> 00:47:09,042
No matter.

520
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:13,676
He's bought Gotham 11 minutes.

521
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:19,549
Come on!

522
00:47:20,174 --> 00:47:21,596
This Way!

523
00:47:27,181 --> 00:47:29,604
Stay there! What are you doing?

524
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,404
Blake, MCU! I'm getting
these boys to safety!

525
00:47:33,563 --> 00:47:34,906
You'll get us all killed!

526
00:47:35,064 --> 00:47:38,068
If anyone crosses this bridge,
they'll blow the city!

527
00:47:38,234 --> 00:47:41,613
It's gonna blow anyway!
We need to open this bridge, now!

528
00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:44,953
Detective, if you take one
step forward we will shoot you!

529
00:47:45,116 --> 00:47:48,711
If you take two steps forward,
we will blow the bridge!

530
00:47:50,788 --> 00:47:54,088
Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me,
all right? Go back and wait.

531
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:01,307
Prepare a convoy. We must secure
the bomb until it detonates.

532
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:06,354
Don't kill him, I want him to feel the heat.

533
00:48:07,096 --> 00:48:11,977
Feel the fire of 12
million souls you failed.

534
00:48:17,899 --> 00:48:19,446
Goodbye, my friend.

535
00:48:27,533 --> 00:48:28,910
Goodbye.

536
00:48:29,452 --> 00:48:32,956
Keep moving forward!
Flank them at the stairs!

537
00:48:41,172 --> 00:48:42,924
Shoot them.

538
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:45,059
Shoot them all.

539
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:57,898
We both know that I
have to kill you now.

540
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:03,035
You'll just have to
imagine the fire.

541
00:49:10,868 --> 00:49:12,916
About the whole no-guns thing...

542
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:16,920
...I'm not sure I feel as
strongly about it as you do.

543
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,931
Pull up.

544
00:49:34,642 --> 00:49:36,064
Stay level.

545
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:51,747
We have to force that convoy east
to the entrance to the reactor.

546
00:49:53,577 --> 00:49:56,581
I need you on the ground,
I'll be in the air. Go.

547
00:49:56,831 --> 00:50:00,085
The situation has changed.
Your orders are out of date.

548
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:04,263
I'm a cop, like you,
and I'm walking out there.

549
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:07,183
Please do not shoot me!

550
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:10,261
Shoot at his feet.

551
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:22,615
Nothing like a little
air superiority.

552
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:24,867
Detective! Please stop!

553
00:50:25,443 --> 00:50:28,538
Please, detective! Stop!

554
00:50:28,696 --> 00:50:30,539
Stop walking!

555
00:50:31,407 --> 00:50:34,126
Blow it! Do it!

556
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,799
You have to get that bomb here.
You've got 10 minutes.

557
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:01,066
They're pushing us to the
entrance of the reactor.

558
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:03,697
They're gonna try to
reconnect the core.

559
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:06,529
You idiots!

560
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:08,615
You sons of bitches!

561
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,530
You're killing us!

562
00:51:10,696 --> 00:51:12,323
Yeah, follow your orders!

563
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:14,996
All right, boys. Get in a circle.
Bow your heads.

564
00:51:17,912 --> 00:51:19,710
It's on my side.

565
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,799
Hey, Father! Let's get everyone
back on the bus, okay? Go, go, go!

566
00:52:10,965 --> 00:52:14,139
- Back on the bus!
- There's nowhere to go.

567
00:52:14,677 --> 00:52:15,724
On the bus!

568
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:14,738
You've got to turn the truck east!

569
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:21,410
Stay straight!

570
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,529
Give me a hand! We can get a cable on it!

571
00:54:03,285 --> 00:54:06,129
Fox showed me how to override the reactor.

572
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:11,127
Oh, dear.

573
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,183
Including the emergency flood.

574
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:36,490
There's no way...

575
00:54:37,403 --> 00:54:38,655
...this bomb...

576
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,077
...will be stopped.

577
00:54:42,283 --> 00:54:43,409
What are you doing?

578
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:45,954
Protection from the blast.
We're gonna be all right!

579
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,417
It's an atom bomb!

580
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,254
Think they need to hear that?
Let them die without hope? Come on!

581
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,839
Prepare yourselves.

582
00:54:54,545 --> 00:54:56,593
My father's work...

583
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,513
...is done.

584
00:55:05,306 --> 00:55:08,230
- What are you doing?
- I can get it out over the bay!

585
00:55:08,684 --> 00:55:10,903
Set it to fly out over the water,
then eject?

586
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:12,688
No autopilot.

587
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:17,694
You could've gone anywhere, been anything.
But you came back here.

588
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:18,986
So did you.

589
00:55:19,445 --> 00:55:21,493
I guess we're both suckers.

590
00:55:29,163 --> 00:55:32,007
- I never cared who you were.
- And you were right.

591
00:55:32,166 --> 00:55:34,760
Shouldn't the people know
the hero who saved them?

592
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:36,090
A hero can be anyone.

593
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:39,177
Even a man doing something
as simple and reassuring...

594
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:43,220
...as putting a coat around a young
boy's shoulders to let him know...

595
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:45,183
...the world hadn't ended.

596
00:56:02,905 --> 00:56:04,373
Bruce Wayne?

597
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:20,590
Come on! There you go! Okay, you too.
Come on, Father.

598
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,735
Hey, heads down! This is it!

599
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,993
- No.
- No, that's Batman!

600
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:34,500
That's detonation!

601
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:43,885
It's out over the bay!
Clear of the city!

602
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:06,578
<i>ON: "I see a beautiful city...</i>

603
00:58:06,737 --> 00:58:08,865
<i>...and a brilliant people...</i>

604
00:58:09,114 --> 00:58:11,116
<i>...rising from this abyss.</i>

605
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:16,331
<i>I see the lives for which I
lay down my life...</i>

606
00:58:16,747 --> 00:58:17,964
<i>...peaceful...</i>

607
00:58:18,707 --> 00:58:21,961
<i>...useful, prosperous and happy.</i>

608
00:58:24,421 --> 00:58:28,051
<i>I see that I hold a sanctuary
in their hearts...</i>

609
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:33,059
<i>...and in the hearts of their descendants...</i>

610
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,607
<i>...generations hence.</i>

611
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:42,531
It is a far, far better
thing that I do...

612
00:58:43,398 --> 00:58:45,366
...than I have ever done.

613
00:58:46,401 --> 00:58:50,907
It is a far, far better
rest that I go to...

614
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:55,544
---than I have ever known-"

615
00:59:13,887 --> 00:59:15,309
I'm so sorry.

616
00:59:15,681 --> 00:59:17,399
I failed you.

617
00:59:19,434 --> 00:59:21,061
You trusted me...

618
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:23,772
...and I failed you.

619
00:59:27,901 --> 00:59:29,699
Can I change your mind...

620
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:33,953
...about quitting the force?

621
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:38,713
You know what you said about
structures becoming shackles?

622
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,629
You were right, and I can't take it.
The injustice.

623
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:47,134
I mean, no one's ever gonna
know who saved an entire city.

624
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:48,429
They know.

625
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,058
It was the Batman.

626
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:13,705
<i>ER: Mr. Wayne's will was not amended to
reflect his more modest estate.</i>

627
01:00:13,864 --> 01:00:17,710
Nonetheless, there are
considerable assets to dispose of.

628
01:00:17,868 --> 01:00:21,338
The contents of the house are to be
sold to settle the estate's accounts...

629
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:25,842
<i>...and the remainder is left in its
entirety to Alfred J. Pennyworth.</i>

630
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:32,175
The house and grounds are left to the
city of Gotham on condition that...

631
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:36,062
...they never be demolished,
altered or otherwise interfered with...

632
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:40,019
...and that they shall be used for
one purpose, and one purpose only:

633
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:45,938
The housing and care of the city's
at-risk and orphaned children.

634
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:50,992
<i>My clerk can help with the smaller
correspondences and instructions.</i>

635
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,573
<i>KE: Blake, John.</i>

636
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:56,115
- Nothing here.
- Uh, try my legal name.

637
01:00:59,534 --> 01:01:02,333
You should use your full name.
I like that name.

638
01:01:02,496 --> 01:01:04,373
- Robin.
- Thanks.

639
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:06,712
<i>SCIENTIST 1: Why worry about the
stabilization software?</i>

640
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,877
This entire autopilot
system's completely obsolete.

641
01:01:09,044 --> 01:01:12,844
Please, I just need to know
what I could've done to fix it.

642
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:17,136
But, Mr. Fox, it's already been fixed.
Software patch. Six months ago.

643
01:01:17,302 --> 01:01:18,895
Check the ID on the patch.

644
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:23,567
Bruce Wayne.

645
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:26,732
- Any news on the missing item?
- Not yet.

646
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,317
They better leave
no stone unturned.

647
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,905
We can't leave a string of
pearls on the manifest as lost.
