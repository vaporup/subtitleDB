7
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,518
You should work harder.

8
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,272
- I need more of your guidance.
- Sure! Let's go and have a wash.

9
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,308
- Brother.
- What's up?

10
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,439
How do you do the Dragon Fist
and Tiger Limb moves?

11
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,033
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

12
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,398
I forgot. Could you show me
some of your moves?

13
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,070
All right. But I may hurt you.

14
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,798
Come on.

15
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,840
You idiot!
You made me look like a fool.

16
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,753
Get up!

17
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,233
- Ready?
- Go ahead. I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,639
Good!

19
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,479
Four.

20
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,439
- It's one!
- You're always so lucky.

21
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,948
You lost!

22
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,999
Can you help me with this, Husker?

23
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,593
Husker!

24
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,196
He was here a moment ago.
Where did he go?

25
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,312
Husker!

26
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,279
Shit! It's broken.

27
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,675
- I could have had that for dinner.
- What's so great about eggs anyway?

28
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,115
If I get any more,
I'll let you know.

29
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,794
But isn't eating eggs
against the rules?

30
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,438
Let me ask the master.

31
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,676
There's no need to disturb him.

32
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,719
I'd better,
otherwise he may punish me.

33
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,676
Why don't you sit down?
Let's talk about it. Go on, sit.

34
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,356
I've got a lot of work to do -
grind down the rice, wash it...

35
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,674
I really don't have time
for chatting.

36
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,354
- I'll do the work for you.
- You'll do it?

37
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,199
Really?

38
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,477
Sure, sit down a moment.
Let's talk about it.

39
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,715
- OK, this time only!
- Fine. Sit here, sit down.

40
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,553
I got you. You broke the eggs.

41
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,471
I'll go and tell the master.

42
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,228
Husker!

43
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,754
Now what?

44
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,274
I'll do the work myself. I'll do it!

45
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,832
That's more like it.

46
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,999
Time for lunch.

47
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,758
Lunch is ready, Husker.

48
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,079
However hard you train,

49
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,470
you'll never be strong enough
to get your revenge.

50
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,872
Do you want to try me?

51
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,110
I know how good you are.

52
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,078
But I always beat you,
don't forget that.

53
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,758
But I never use my full power.

54
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,598
Use more power
to fight with me right now.

55
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,557
I will... some other time.

56
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,916
Why not now? Come on!

57
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,718
It's lunch time!

58
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,518
Well, am I strong enough?

59
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,077
Not bad, but you're not good enough
to fight the Manchus yet.

60
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,839
"However hard you train,

61
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,276
"you'll never be strong enough
to get your revenge.

62
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,029
"But you're not good enough
to fight the Manchus yet."

63
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,873
'The Manchus?'

64
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,320
You're getting in my way!

65
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,193
My friend.

66
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,874
I'm taking a shower.

67
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,711
This is not a playground.

68
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,715
- Please, stop messing around.
- We're not messing. Come on!

69
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:22,157
You old fool, why didn't you give
my man credit yesterday?

70
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,834
- I've come to buy the goods now.
- That's right.

71
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,673
- 100 kilos of noodles.
- 10 jars of vinegar.

72
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,390
Noodles for you, vinegar for him.
And I'll have 50 salted fish.

73
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,394
That's really a lot. I haven't got
that much in my little shop.

74
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,118
Please go somewhere else.

75
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,515
You don't want to do business
with us. Let's have some fun.

76
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,078
I'm going to break this jar.

77
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,437
Please... Please.

78
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,955
Go to hell!

79
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,639
What are you staring at?

80
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,989
Please... Please stop it.

81
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,991
Now see who's asking for favours.

82
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,753
- Get out!
- Move!

83
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,231
You bloody Manchus. I'll break
your arms if you do that again.

84
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,476
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

85
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,278
Uncle Dak! Uncle Dak!

86
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,474
Are you all right, Uncle Dak?

87
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,359
I'm useless! I must get revenge!

88
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,799
Uncle Dak.

89
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,196
How sad! How sad!

90
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,876
We are all
under the control of the Manchus.

91
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,670
In their minds,
our lives are worthless.

92
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,590
Don't be so upset.

93
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,796
You should join the Shaolin Temple.

94
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,235
You can learn
how to defend yourself there.

95
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,194
The Manchus are a mean bunch.

96
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,353
If I wait two more years,
then more people will die.

97
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,516
No. I must go now.

98
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,394
But how can I leave
the Shaolin Temple?

99
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,678
Nobody leaves this place
without first passing the challenges.

100
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,952
'What should I do?'

101
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,393
Husker!

102
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,118
It's you?

103
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,192
Who did you expect?
Of course it's me.

104
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,669
Are they going to take me back
to the temple?

105
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,189
You've broken the rules, Husker.

106
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,716
The Abbot has expelled you
from the Shaolin Temple.

107
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,675
Brother...

108
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,638
Enough. Master ordered me
to give you the challenges

109
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,632
so you're better qualified
to deal with life's problems.

110
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,188
Buddha be praised.

111
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,316
The first challenge.

112
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,560
You didn't guard your right side.

113
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,392
The second challenge.

114
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,635
Protect both your head and your legs.

115
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,712
The third challenge.

116
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,640
Use both your hands and your legs.

117
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,954
Brother!
Give me the fourth challenge.

118
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,078
Guard your body
when attacking and defending.

119
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,839
Thank you very much, masters.

120
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,515
Buddha be praised.

121
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,995
Brother, thanks for helping me
while I was at the temple.

122
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,393
Don't mention it. Get up.

123
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,679
From now on, you'd better be smart
and take care of yourself.

124
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,036
Go to see Tak,
if you have any problems.

125
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,119
Here's some money,
put it in your pocket.

126
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,112
Thanks a lot, brother.

127
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,357
Don't forget.

128
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,793
"Hoh Heng Dye Factory"

129
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,711
Brother...

130
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,959
- Morning.
- Morning.

131
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,837
Go and do your shopping.

132
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,152
Don't forget today is Mum's birthday
so come straight home after work.

133
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,151
Yes, I know, you old nag.

134
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,552
- I'll find you a deaf husband.
- I'm not talking to you any more.

135
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,757
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

136
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,988
Not bad, eh?

137
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,872
- What are you doing?
- You don't need to pay.

138
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,439
I'll pay for it later.

139
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,559
Are you serious? All my customers
pay for their fish straightaway.

140
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,995
- Bastard!
- You must pay now.

141
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,991
You can't leave like that.

142
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,958
- Pay up!
- Why should I?

143
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,112
Do you want to lose your business?

144
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,199
Bloody Manchus! A curse
on all your newborn children.

145
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,638
- What are you doing?
- Are you blind?

146
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,870
You're taking advantage of me.

147
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,474
Are you trying to rape me?
I'm not afraid of you!

148
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,519
When I was a prostitute, I could
handle more than 10 men in a day.

149
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,512
- Why are you going into my house?
- Please don't!

150
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,872
Oh, tough guys?
How dare you bully me!

151
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,272
If I open my legs,
you won't be able to move me.

152
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,829
I'm moving!

153
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,553
Get over there!

154
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,350
Come on. Come on.

155
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,035
- Come on. Come on!
- Go away!

156
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,634
- Do you want to see a live sex show?
- Please stop! You're hurting me!

157
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,073
Get out!

158
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,359
Sit down and shut your mouth.

159
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,597
- You're very pretty, too.
- Leave my face alone!

160
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,518
Help!

161
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,359
Do you want to have an orgy with us?

162
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,193
No way!
I'm not a prostitute any more.

163
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,714
If you rape me,
you'll have very bad luck!

164
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,036
You old bitch.
How dare you say such a thing!

165
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,035
- Keep your hands off me!
- Sit down.

166
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,431
Did you enjoy it? You enjoyed it!

167
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,195
Don't touch me!

168
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,473
Who cares about you?

169
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,629
Let's go.

170
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,950
You first. You first.

171
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,394
Here it comes!

172
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,470
- Where's Liang?
- Over there.

173
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,957
- Liang!
- Hello.

174
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,749
Liang!

175
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,796
- I'll be back.
- This way.

176
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,270
What's the matter? Tell me.

177
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,557
- Liang.
- Don't cry.

178
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,470
Come on, tell me, what's the matter?

179
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,831
Is it true?

180
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,797
Come with me!

181
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,075
Who the hell did that to her?!

182
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,038
- Where's my sister?
- In her room.

183
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,639
Sister!

184
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,437
Who... Who did this to you?

185
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,713
Who? Tell me...

186
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,350
Who did it? Tell me!

187
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,639
Sister!

188
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,516
Tell me who did it!

189
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,836
Tell me! Tell me! Who did it?

190
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,914
- Liang.
- Who did it?

191
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,629
We'd better leave her in peace
so she can rest.

192
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,237
They wanted to rape me, too.

193
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,880
Bloody Manchus!

194
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,028
- What? Manchus did that?
- Yes. Please... don't grab me...

195
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,348
Who was it?

196
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,989
I don't know his name,
but he had a fan in his hand.

197
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,834
Son of a bitch!

198
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,835
Sister!

199
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,989
- Sister! What are you doing?
- Daughter!

200
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,873
Daughter!

201
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,998
Sister... Sister!

202
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,558
Daughter!

203
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,839
Daughter!

204
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,480
Why did this have to happen to her?

205
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,437
Sister! Sister!

206
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,072
Daughter! Daughter!

207
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,951
Liang, where are you going?

208
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,551
I'm going to kill that Manchu.

209
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:33,677
There are so many of them.
How do you know which one did it?

210
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,830
I don't care. I'll kill all of them!

211
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,876
- Let me go!
- Liang!

212
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,596
- Let me go!
- Liang!

213
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,959
Please don't go. You're
the only child I have left now.

214
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,192
- I have to go and kill him.
- Please don't go...

215
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,350
Mum! Mum...

216
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,590
Please... don't do that.

217
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,831
Get up. Get up.

218
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,992
OK, I'm not going.

219
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,475
He's very naughty,
and never listens to what I say.

220
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,956
- He really gives me a headache!
- Kids are all like that.

221
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,959
- Can I join you?
- Go away! You're blocking my way.

222
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,911
- Can I join you?
- Get lost!

223
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,678
You don't want me...

224
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,672
- Give it back!
- Jump and get it.

225
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,591
Pass it to me.

226
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,910
If you catch it, it's yours.

227
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,835
- Give it back!
- Give it back!

228
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,916
You broke our shuttlecock,
so you have to buy us a new one!

229
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,356
- You like playing shuttlecock?
- Of course!

230
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,075
- Do you want me to get a new one?
- Yes! Yes!

231
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,793
My braid?!

232
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,837
You cut off my braid!
I want it back, give it back!

233
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,071
How do you like
your new shuttlecock?!

234
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,434
I want it back!

235
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,953
Catch!

236
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,710
I want it back.
Give me back my braid!

237
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,678
OK, I'll give it back to you.

238
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,595
Give me back my braid.

239
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,755
Here's your braid.

240
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,550
I want it back. Give me back
my braid. I want it back.

241
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,631
They all had their braids cut off.

242
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,154
You were trying to escape,
little bugger!

243
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,435
Let's teach you a lesson.

244
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,958
You seem to be
the bravest of the lot.

245
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,992
Little brat!

246
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,078
I'll make you cry now!

247
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,597
Great men shed blood, not tears.
I'm not going to cry.

248
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,908
Cowards!

249
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,512
My hair will grow long again soon.

250
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,918
You're just a big bully.
Pick on someone your own size!

251
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,436
It's none of your business.
You're just a show-off!

252
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,954
You're quite right. I am a show-off.

253
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,275
- Let's get out of here.
- OK.

254
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,191
Are you leaving, too?

255
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,080
God, you're really heavy!

256
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,756
OK, they've got their own back.
You can let me go now.

257
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,400
Let you go? Not a chance!

258
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,477
Come here, come here. Have you ever
played tug of war before?

259
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,471
- We have!
- Let's have a game.

260
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,358
- You pull his head, I pull his legs.
- Great!

261
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,115
Please stop! Please stop!

262
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,474
Let go of me!

263
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,198
The Manchu deserves all he gets.

264
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,076
A Manchu?

265
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,308
A Manchu killed my sister.

266
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,989
'Manchu! Manchu! Manchu!'

267
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,119
- Why are you stabbing him?
- Don't stop me!

268
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,839
Don't stop me! I want him dead.

269
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,229
Let me kill him. I want him dead.

270
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,436
- Why are you doing this?
- A Manchu raped my sister.

271
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,354
- Was it him?
- I don't know, but he's a Manchu.

272
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,594
You don't know who he really is.
Look, you've killed him. Now what?

273
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,678
- I've got to go. Bye!
- Stop! Stop!

274
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,678
Damn, they'll think I did it.
I'd better get out of here now!

275
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,471
- He's dead!
- We're too late!

276
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,672
Who would dare kill a Manchu?

277
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,394
It must be the people
from the dye factory.

278
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,914
No one else would have the guts
to do it.

279
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,237
OK! Get rid of them!

280
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,396
- You'd better come back early.
- All right.

281
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,518
The Manchus are coming!

282
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,033
The Manchus are coming!

283
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,193
Boss, a group of Manchus
are coming this way.

284
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,469
Really?!

285
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,198
Get the weapons!

286
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,719
- What do you want?
- Hand over the murderer.

287
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,038
What murderer?

288
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,591
Who killed him?

289
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,516
How should I know? I have no idea.

290
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,232
- Find the killer.
- Yes, sir!

291
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,473
He's not here.

292
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,196
- He must be hiding. Check inside!
- Yes, sir!

293
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,432
Wait! These grounds belong
to the factory.

294
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,073
You can't throw
your weight around here.

295
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,071
What if you can't find him?

296
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,079
If we can't find him, you'll be fine.
Otherwise you're in big trouble.

297
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,276
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

298
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,837
Follow them.

299
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,798
- Make sure they don't do any damage.
- Yes, sir!

300
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,955
No.

301
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,593
No! Go that way!

302
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,711
No.

303
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,718
No, there's no one inside.

304
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,994
Now what?

305
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,116
It's not over yet.
I'll get you sooner or later.

306
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,792
Let's go!

307
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,679
"Sai Sin Temple"

308
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,236
What? You left the Shaolin Temple.

309
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,629
Brother,
I can't wait to get my revenge.

310
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,109
What?! You're not the only one.

311
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,511
So many people want to get
their revenge on the Manchus.

312
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,996
You're the luckiest one
because your kung fu is so good.

313
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,712
Many of them
can't even defend themselves.

314
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,117
I sent you to the Shaolin Temple
for a reason.

315
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,115
I was hoping after you graduated,
you could help the community.

316
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,317
But you're as stubborn
and selfish as ever.

317
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,949
You only care about
getting your revenge.

318
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,076
Brother, what should I do, then?

319
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,676
You should put aside your hatred
and be patient.

320
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,433
If you do that,
you'll achieve your goals.

321
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,239
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

322
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,797
- Why the long face, then?
- What do you expect?

323
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,792
Smile. I want you to smile! Come on!

324
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,032
That's more like it.

325
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,036
From now on, you should
at least appear to be happy.

326
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,549
I have a student called Liang.

327
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,317
His sister was raped by a Manchu
a few days ago.

328
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,999
When she got home she was so upset
she committed suicide.

329
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,036
Liang wants revenge, too.

330
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,831
- But I told him to be patient...
- Master!

331
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,629
Talk of the devil!
This is the man I was talking about.

332
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,910
- Master! Master...
- Liang, my colleague, Husker.

333
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,834
- It's you.
- You know each other?!

334
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,868
I met him before in your place.

335
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,593
Right.
Husker just left the Shaolin temple.

336
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,432
How do you do?

337
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,033
Master, your wine.

338
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:56,836
Liang works at the dye factory.
His boss is a good friend of mine.

339
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,596
I often teach his workers kung fu.
As you know, I'm always busy.

340
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,150
Now you're here,
you can teach the workers for me.

341
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,473
When their kung fu is good enough,
the Manchus won't bother them again.

342
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:14,235
- Whatever you say!
- That's great!

343
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,598
If Husker teaches us, then we can
really teach the Manchus a lesson!

344
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,274
There you go again!
Stop that nonsense!

345
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,955
You had enough boring vegetables
and tofu in the temple.

346
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,996
I'll get you something nice tonight.

347
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,036
- What is it?
- I know.

348
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,951
- I know. It's...
- Enough talk!

349
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,830
- Master, you're a hungry man.
- Let's go. Stop talking nonsense.

350
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,751
Very tasty!

351
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,673
I'll have that.

352
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,514
This hot pot is delicious!
It's really tasty!

353
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,397
Yeah! Cheers!

354
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,192
Why do they put the sheep's heads
up there?

355
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,990
They use them
to draw in the customers.

356
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,912
The fools think they're serving lamb
here, but it's really dog meat!

357
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,751
I'm thinking of going to this place.
But you're too chicken to come.

358
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,438
- I fear nothing!
- Oh, really?!

359
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,839
Yes, really.

360
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,273
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

361
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,430
- I'm ready.
- Waiter! The bill!

362
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:47,111
Roast peanuts!
Get your roast peanuts here!

363
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,875
Here we are!

364
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,315
- Are you here for some fun, too?
- Yeah.

365
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,197
Even you need sex.

366
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,516
- Let's go inside.
- Come on.

367
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,794
"Madame Fifi's"

368
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,358
Roast peanuts!

369
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,994
Come here!

370
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,954
- What's the problem?
- You're both mad!

371
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,871
What did you bring me here for?

372
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,669
- You know about my vow of celibacy.
- But you just ate dog meat.

373
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,478
That's different!

374
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,597
- Come on!
- Leave me alone!

375
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,752
I've had enough!
Liang, you take care of your master.

376
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,115
I've got to go. Sorry, Brother!

377
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,838
Master! What about me?

378
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,997
- If your wife doesn't mind, go on.
- All right!

379
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,916
Don't come looking for my help
if you pick up any diseases.

380
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,956
I only treat physical injuries.

381
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,598
I won't be that unlucky!

382
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,753
This way!

383
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,876
Some tea for Mr Cheung!

384
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,916
- This way, sir!
- All right.

385
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,550
I want to see Ah Sung. Quick!

386
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,392
Husker, Husker.

387
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,835
- Where's your master?
- Outside!

388
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,751
I want to have some fun, too.

389
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,079
Uncle Feng! Uncle Feng!

390
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,311
- I haven't seen you for a while.
- I was away.

391
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,153
- Are you looking for Ah Kim?
- That's right!

392
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,273
Come on, quick.

393
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,191
Were you away fishing again?

394
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,114
Yes, I was alone at sea
for a few months.

395
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,431
I can't wait any longer.
I'm desperate to see Ah Kim.

396
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,829
- Right. Right...
- Quick! Quick!

397
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,273
Hurry up!

398
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:05,111
- What's wrong with your pipe?
- It's blocked.

399
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,199
It was fine before.

400
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,877
- Is it OK now?
- It's fine. It's fine again.

401
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,077
- Hurry up! Hurry up! Go!
- Yeah!

402
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,798
I'm going! I'm going!

403
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,079
There, the door's closed.

404
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,593
How many of you?

405
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,434
- Do you know any of the girls here?
- I do. I can introduce you.

406
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,671
- I'd like to look around first.
- All right.

407
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,034
This way!

408
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:37,475
- See you later.
- Enjoy yourselves!

409
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,313
So pretty!

410
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,192
- Come on...
- No...

411
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,236
Come on! Don't be shy!

412
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,033
Open your mouth.

413
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,912
I said no.

414
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,470
- Why not? Why not?
- No...

415
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,835
You didn't mind before.

416
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:22,833
Come on, there's a good girl.
There's no need to be shy.

417
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,277
I don't do it on the first
or the fifteenth of the month.

418
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,031
What shall I do, then?

419
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,634
Just do it the normal way.

420
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,390
Is there anyone you fancy?

421
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,955
You're not looking for a wife!

422
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,598
Buy me a drink.

423
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:21,150
Don't come here if you're so shy!
Get lost!

424
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,633
Sorry! Sorry!

425
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,831
It's you two. Nice girls.
Have a good time!

426
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,553
Go on!

427
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,993
Stop!

428
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,319
That's the guy.

429
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,191
Did you kill Fang?

430
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,239
Was that no?!

431
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,199
I didn't kill him.

432
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,158
- Who was it, then?
- Tell us!

433
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:27,470
- I don't know...
- Tell us!

434
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,233
Get back here.

435
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,951
So you want to leave, do you?

436
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,956
Then you'll have to crawl under
everyone's legs.

437
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,160
- Go on!
- Go on!

438
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,152
- Hurry up! Crawl!
- Crawl!

439
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,789
- Crawl!
- Come on!

440
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,198
Let's go back upstairs.

441
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,354
That's all, folks.

442
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,515
Who hit me?

443
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,311
Brother, why did you hit me?

444
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,996
You are such a coward!

445
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,913
How could let them
walk all over you like that?

446
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,515
You're the one who told me
I should be patient.

447
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,433
There's a limit.
You can't let them do that to you.

448
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,199
- No?!
- Of course not!

449
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,633
You said it.

450
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,071
This is a donation from them
to your temple.

451
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,118
How could he do that?

452
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,156
Stop it! Please! My furniture!

453
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:23,913
Who is it?

454
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,399
Master!

455
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:45,150
Watch him fight.
You can learn a lot from him.

456
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,510
Stop moving your head, mister!
You're blocking my view.

457
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:11,151
I can't help it.
I spend most of my time at sea.

458
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,915
I think your real problem
is you come here too often.

459
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,355
- What?!
- I'm leaving!

460
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,636
Crawl!

461
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,717
Crawl!

462
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,598
It's over. Let's go!

463
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,796
Get up! Quick!

464
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,592
It's all over. Go back to your rooms!

465
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,915
- Master, he's a great fighter.
- Of course!

466
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,436
Don't forget
we learnt kung fu together.

467
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,836
- Brother.
- You're very naughty.

468
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,478
Now they're happy!

469
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,357
I'm very happy now.

470
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,159
Kao and Lo are going to help us.
They'll be here right after work.

471
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,669
- You think they can do it?
- They're not that great, are they?

472
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:45,156
You'll see for yourselves soon.

473
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,677
We'll control the whole city
in less than three months' time.

474
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,359
That really hurts.

475
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,709
Keep going!

476
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:47,799
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

477
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,950
- Tuck in!
- Right! Right!

478
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,270
- Help yourselves!
- Tuck in.

479
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:57,237
You have this.

480
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,634
Let me top you up.

481
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,552
You two can live here.

482
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,352
There's something
I'd like you to help me with.

483
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,870
No problem! We're on the same side.
If you need help, just let us know.

484
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,553
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

485
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,039
This is the situation.

486
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:30,148
We, the Manchus,
control everything in this area.

487
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,511
However...

488
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,833
the Hans are the only ones
who are making any money.

489
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:43,313
The fact is, their property
should belong to us.

490
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,871
And we have a right to it.

491
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:51,438
The Hans are a useless lot
who work at Hoh Heng Dye Factory,

492
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,954
but they think
they are really powerful

493
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,951
and keep getting on our nerves.

494
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,315
I say we must get rid of them.

495
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,430
That's no problem.

496
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,833
After you get rid of them,
you can do anything you want here.

497
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:13,750
- Down in one!
- Down in one!

498
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,353
Try this!

499
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,793
- Try this?!
- Stop it!

500
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,189
I'll be gentle.

501
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,432
Stop! Don't run away from me.
I'll catch you.

502
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:39,993
Let her go!

503
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,234
Don't worry.

504
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,314
Step aside.

505
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,915
Stop!

506
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,714
Why are you here, brother?!

507
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:12,715
They think I've been working too hard
so they gave me two months holiday.

508
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,354
Who was that man? He was so rude!

509
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:23,953
We've hired them to help us, brother.

510
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,671
I've told you many times,

511
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,911
don't think your brother
is a high-ranking official

512
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,752
just so you can cause trouble.

513
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:36,277
It won't do either of us any good.

514
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,994
I'm going to have a rest.
Behave yourself!

515
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,075
- Let's continue our meal!
- Let's continue!

516
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,513
Don't drink so much
if you can't take it.

517
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,355
Come on!

518
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,556
Why is the master not coming?

519
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,474
His brother just came back and
they want to have a good long chat.

520
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,951
It makes no difference which of us
goes, I also know it very well.

521
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,950
I need 3,000 lengths of cloth
in five days, can you do it?

522
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,758
Yes, I can.

523
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,076
You have to have them ready on time,
otherwise I'll be in trouble.

524
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,119
You'll be in trouble, too.
Do you understand?

525
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,633
Yes, I understand.

526
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,230
Don't make up your mind so quickly.

527
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,912
If you go back on the deal,

528
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,879
you'll have to give me your whole
factory as compensation.

529
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,236
Trust me!
There won't be any delays.

530
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,158
Good! Good!

531
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,153
- Let me give you the deposit.
- OK!

532
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,198
Sign your name
on the bottom of this contract.

533
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:34,549
Of course!

534
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,679
Good! Good!

535
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:47,957
- I'm leaving.
- All right.

536
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,791
I'll pick up the cloth in five days.

537
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,672
- Have a nice day, goodbye!
- Take care!

538
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,594
- Liang?!
- Yes!

539
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,432
Cheng, take over.

540
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,235
- What's up, boss?
- Go and get 50 containers of dye.

541
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,639
- That much!
- The deadline is very soon. Just go!

542
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,799
I'm going right now.

543
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,597
- Where are you going?
- To get dye!

544
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:39,749
See you later!

545
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,917
We haven't got that colour.
What about other colours?

546
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,039
- You haven't. Never mind!
- Bye!

547
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,351
- How can I help?
- Do you have red dye?

548
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,477
I'm sorry! We just sold out.
Try somewhere else.

549
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,551
Sold out?!

550
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,995
Sold out...

551
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:12,755
- Hello!
- Hi.

552
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,273
Do you have any red dye?

553
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,999
Red? We had a lot two days ago.

554
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:19,992
- What about now?
- We still have...

555
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:24,119
- Great! Can I have 50 containers?
- ..to wait for the next shipment.

556
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,474
That's no, then!

557
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,552
If you want to order it,
you must leave a deposit.

558
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,232
No way!

559
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:33,238
What should we do?

560
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,199
If we don't give them the cloth
on time, we'll be in big trouble.

561
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,679
Can't we delay the order?

562
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,594
Are you kidding?
I've signed my name on the contract.

563
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:50,195
If I don't give it to them on time,
they'll take my factory.

564
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,870
- You shouldn't have signed it.
- What? I thought it was a good deal.

565
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,272
- But...
- Stop there.

566
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,915
- He asked you to sign a contract?
- Yes.

567
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,718
And he wants it in five days?

568
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,677
With no delays!

569
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,269
- Can you get the dye from the shops?
- No, none of them has it.

570
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,635
Even the wholesaler hasn't got it!

571
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:30,159
There's something... funny going on.

572
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,478
I think so, too.

573
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,232
They can't all be
out of red dye at the same time.

574
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:41,636
And also, that old man's face
was very familiar.

575
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,996
The Manchus must have set us up.

576
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,479
The Manchus!

577
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,471
That's it! It's the Manchus!

578
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,518
The Manchus!

579
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,953
"Aoi Lo Ane House"

580
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:27,068
Are you sure that's it?

581
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,197
I've worked there for years.
Of course I'm sure.

582
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,629
- Husker, well done!
- Your men did all the work.

583
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,917
- Don't forget to reward them.
- I won't forget.

584
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,389
Let's get to work.

585
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,792
- We've got them this time.
- Yes, you're right.

586
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,799
My plan is really good, isn't it?

587
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:44,468
If they don't have the cloth on time,
we can legally take over the factory.

588
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:47,632
You two will be in charge of it.

589
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,439
You'll soon be businessmen.

590
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:14,314
You don't have the cloth ready,
do you?

591
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,515
It's ready.

592
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,234
You...

593
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,279
Don't waste our time.

594
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,234
Pay up
once you've checked the cloth.

595
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,878
You...

596
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:05,113
- Our dye was stolen!
- What?!

597
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:39,275
- Tell them to go over there first.
- Go over there now.

598
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,473
What are you doing?

599
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,112
Come here!

600
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,151
Help! Get off me!

601
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,948
What do you think you're doing?
Get off her!

602
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,150
- What are you doing?
- Bitch! Go to hell!

603
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,308
Come on!

604
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,033
Bitch!

605
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:36,231
Cheers!

606
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,718
- Let's have a game!
- Hang on!

607
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,834
We made a lot of money,

608
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:45,912
but the Manchus
really made fools of themselves.

609
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,391
I wish Husker was here as well.
We should celebrate with him.

610
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,756
We can do that another day.
Cheers, everybody!

611
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:04,709
Get them!

612
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,673
Stop there!

613
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,239
You first!

614
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,755
I want them all dead!

615
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,312
You really are useless!

616
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,037
Ah Chen! Ah Chen!

617
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,033
Master...

618
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,877
Master...

619
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,235
you're always telling me
to be patient.

620
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,595
My whole family has been murdered.

621
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,036
Even my mother was killed.
I've had enough of being patient.

622
01:16:15,800 --> 01:16:21,158
Husker... This is the last favour
I'll ever ask you to do for me.

623
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:26,232
- Please...
- I know what to do.

624
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,038
Buddha be praised.

625
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,630
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

626
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:30,395
Let's make a toast.

627
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:35,554
We don't need to worry about them
any more.

628
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,313
Buddha be praised.

629
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,155
You're still alive.
Why are you here?

630
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:01,596
Don't be so surprised.
We're here for your funeral.

631
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:03,910
Bullshit! We'll kill you!

632
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:15,438
Buddha be praised.

633
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:41,515
Buddha...

634
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,239
Buddha be praised.

635
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,389
Buddha be praised.

636
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,034
Hold it!

637
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,477
- Brother...
- Enough. I know everything now.

638
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,394
This is my house! How dare you
come here and kill my men!

639
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,153
An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

640
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,590
How dare you?! Kill them!

641
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,351
Go to hell!

642
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,109
Buddha be praised.

643
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,871
Buddha be praised.
