1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:04,346
Where's Lin?!

2
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:19,726
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:26,166
Gotcha!

4
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:30,276
Just looking out for number one.

5
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:31,176
No!

6
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,376
The kid got the seal!

7
00:00:50,196 --> 00:00:51,526
Chon!

8
00:01:00,706 --> 00:01:01,866
It's stuck.

9
00:01:11,386 --> 00:01:12,116
Lin!

10
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:26,556
Go! You can do it!

11
00:01:26,636 --> 00:01:29,996
She's got it.

12
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:31,126
She's got it!

13
00:01:31,206 --> 00:01:33,636
Roy! Come on!

14
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:36,136
Chon, what in our history together

15
00:01:36,206 --> 00:01:38,676
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

16
00:01:38,776 --> 00:01:40,336
- Roy!
- I can't do that!

17
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:41,276
Hurry up!

18
00:01:41,346 --> 00:01:43,336
Wait.

19
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,106
There's a better way.

20
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:56,756
Slow down!

21
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,266
I'm a bat out of hell!

22
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,056
Yee-haw!

23
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,496
Besides, I don't know
where the brake is.

24
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,556
What?!

25
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,106
Look out!

26
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:31,656
So, what now, buddy?

27
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:35,136
Relax, relax.
Smooth sailing from here.

28
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,536
Yes, these are the men
who attacked me.

29
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:51,846
I'm afraid the assailants have
temporarily eluded us, my Lord.

30
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,856
Perhaps you could explain to me

31
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,976
how Loony Lin managed to escape

32
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:59,716
from the confines of
Scotland Yard under the watch

33
00:02:59,796 --> 00:03:04,226
of the most respected
police force in the world.

34
00:03:04,296 --> 00:03:07,426
Yes, of course.
It's absolutely fascinating.

35
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,596
She picked the lock

36
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:13,066
using a deck of rather
risque playing cards.

37
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:17,406
Then scaled the walls
with a mop, a fork...

38
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:19,906
and various pilfered undergarments.

39
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:21,636
You've got to hand it to the Chinese.

40
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:24,306
They're awfully ingenious,
Lord, aren't they?

41
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:28,016
Does your incompetence know
no bounds?!

42
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:59,376
Where am I?

43
00:04:00,516 --> 00:04:02,746
Lin!

44
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,986
I don't even know these women.

45
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:11,956
Lin, what are you doing here?

46
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,756
Oh, Lord.

47
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,696
Do you want to try
the position on page 37?

48
00:04:21,736 --> 00:04:24,076
Come here, you little minx.

49
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,916
What?

50
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,456
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

51
00:04:42,526 --> 00:04:44,896
I've just been violated
by a barnyard animal.

52
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:52,596
Who would leave a pile of stones
in the middle of the field?

53
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,736
I don't know, Chon.
These people are nuts.

54
00:04:57,376 --> 00:04:58,706
Come on.

55
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:06,206
- Can I tell you something?
- What?

56
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,616
This is a hell
of a damn adventure we're on.

57
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,916
I'm having
an absolute ball with you.

58
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:14,756
Me too.

59
00:05:19,566 --> 00:05:21,396
Here we go.

60
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:23,296
Get your thumb out, maharaja.

61
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,856
- Why?
- Get over here.

62
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:27,636
Excuse me!

63
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,906
- Lin!
- Lin!

64
00:05:38,986 --> 00:05:41,476
My shoulder's getting
a little tight.

65
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,176
This is your first time
in England, isn't it?

66
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:49,096
How do you know your way around?
It's incredible.

67
00:05:49,156 --> 00:05:51,596
I always had a good sense
of direction.

68
00:05:51,666 --> 00:05:53,526
You can say that again.

69
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:56,936
I wish we could say the same
about you-know-who.

70
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:58,696
I once sent him over a mountain range.

71
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,166
He was lost forever.

72
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:03,896
One time, I sent him
over the Great Wall.

73
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:07,706
- He was lost for three days.
- Three days?!

74
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:12,116
Oh, gosh, we got a lot in common.

75
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:14,616
I've never met
anybody like you, Roy.

76
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:16,516
- Really?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:21,326
Hey, can I tell you something
without you getting offended?

78
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:22,686
What?

79
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,886
You have a great body.

80
00:06:25,966 --> 00:06:28,896
There. I said it.
It's out in the open.

81
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:33,826
- You must work out.
- Me?

82
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,066
Excuse me.

83
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,706
Chon, what are you doing?

84
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,176
I don't like the backseat.

85
00:06:42,216 --> 00:06:45,546
Makes me sick. Dizzy.

86
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,216
Whitechapel.

87
00:06:54,296 --> 00:06:56,726
This looks like
a nice enough neighborhood.

88
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:02,496
- What is Puss 'n' Boots?
- It's a boardinghouse.

89
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:05,936
Some of the sailors on the ship
coming over recommended it.

90
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:12,936
Come on. Come on!

91
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:22,886
I won't let my sister stay here.

92
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:25,086
What are we supposed to do?
Check in to the Savoy?

93
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:26,986
We'll get arrested
before we get to our room.

94
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:28,716
I don't mind this place.

95
00:07:32,696 --> 00:07:36,566
See?
She's a little open-minded.

96
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:39,106
I know this sounds crazy
'cause I just met her...

97
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:41,966
but I think I'm falling for her.

98
00:07:42,006 --> 00:07:43,266
I think she's the one.

99
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,066
Roy, she's my baby sister.

100
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:47,206
I know she is.
Thank God!

101
00:07:47,276 --> 00:07:48,676
That's the only chance
I've got.

102
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:50,716
Look, I'm getting ready
to launch a little thing

103
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,546
called "Operation:
Sweep Her Off Her Feet."

104
00:07:52,616 --> 00:07:54,676
You're in a position to talk me up.

105
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:56,086
Can I count on you?

106
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:58,216
Please, buddy, I've never
asked you for anything.

107
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,656
Sure, Roy.
I'll tell her the truth.

108
00:08:00,726 --> 00:08:02,086
Don't get hung up on the truth.

109
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:04,716
Feel free to smooth out
your old pal's rough edges.

110
00:08:06,796 --> 00:08:08,896
I love you, buddy.

111
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,296
Lin. Come.

112
00:08:20,076 --> 00:08:21,376
Sit.

113
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:48,406
Hello, love.

114
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,876
Fancy a tumble?

115
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,136
Oh!
Where were you two days ago?

116
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:55,406
I would have bedded you
in a second.

117
00:08:55,476 --> 00:08:57,106
Now you're looking
at a changed man.

118
00:08:57,186 --> 00:09:00,176
I'm sort of saving myself
for someone special.

119
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,116
I'll give you a discount.

120
00:09:03,256 --> 00:09:07,696
That's the most romantic thing
any woman's ever said to me.

121
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,956
You better go.

122
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,156
You better go
before we lose control. Go!

123
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:14,396
If you change your mind...

124
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,526
Roy!

125
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:27,306
Lin. Our father would talk about
the right man for you.

126
00:09:27,376 --> 00:09:30,346
He must be strong, courageous...

127
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,976
and a good father.

128
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:35,416
- Like Roy.
- We got her, Chon.

129
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:37,246
Not like Roy.

130
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,086
You don't know him like I do.

131
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:42,056
He has many bad habits.

132
00:09:42,096 --> 00:09:43,256
Such as?

133
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:47,126
He drinks, smokes, and he gambles.

134
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:48,786
Chon, where are you going with this?

135
00:09:48,866 --> 00:09:50,796
He sleeps with women for money.

136
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:52,126
What are you...

137
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:56,136
Roy don't do that.
I can see inside him.

138
00:09:56,206 --> 00:09:57,606
He has a good heart.

139
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:58,766
That's right.

140
00:09:58,846 --> 00:10:02,246
His salmon don't swim upstream.

141
00:10:02,316 --> 00:10:03,606
He shoots blanks.

142
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:07,446
Lin, he cannot be trusted.

143
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:11,006
How could you say that?
You're his friend.

144
00:10:11,086 --> 00:10:13,556
Yeah, sort of.

145
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:15,056
Roy is the type of a friend

146
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,456
you'd never introduce
to your other friends

147
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,296
or bring home to your family.

148
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:22,096
He never speak the truth.
You know what I call him?

149
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:25,036
Not Roy O'Bannon.
Roy O'Baloney.

150
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,266
I don't care.

151
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,436
Lin, I forbid it.

152
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,496
You are not my father.

153
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:46,386
Roy, there you are.

154
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,986
- Hi.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:52,156
You need anything, buddy?

156
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:55,326
A whole lot of
"leave me alone."

157
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,236
What's wrong?

158
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:02,506
Nothing.

159
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,506
I woke up
on the wrong side of the bed.

160
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,736
I feel a little pain in my back
like someone put a knife there.

161
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,576
I'm okay.

162
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:11,476
Don't worry about me.

163
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,586
Roy!

164
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,626
Ta-da!

165
00:11:28,696 --> 00:11:30,966
That actually reminds me of a trick.

166
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:33,026
You ever seen this one?!

167
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:34,196
Or this one?!

168
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:37,936
You think you're so cool
with your karate

169
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:40,606
and your childlike reflexes.

170
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:44,416
Roy, you okay?

171
00:11:45,116 --> 00:11:47,206
Look at you.

172
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:50,186
Do you really call me Roy Baloney?

173
00:11:53,426 --> 00:11:55,016
Roy, you don't understand.

174
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:57,956
You just smashed my puzzle box.

175
00:11:58,996 --> 00:12:01,086
I'll never figure out my message.

176
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,996
- Roy...
- Go.

177
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:06,836
You're dead to me.

178
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:09,306
I don't know a Chon Wang.

179
00:12:23,286 --> 00:12:24,316
What?

180
00:12:24,386 --> 00:12:26,616
Hi, Roy.

181
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,456
Who loves you, baby?

182
00:12:29,526 --> 00:12:32,186
- Nice try, Chon.
- Roy...

183
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,926
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:42,006
You do that again,
and you're a dead man.

185
00:12:52,746 --> 00:12:53,846
Pillow fight!

186
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:23,136
I am Roy Baloney!

187
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:24,206
Yes!

188
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:25,276
I'm full of it!

189
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:26,646
You are!

190
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,676
Roy?

191
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:59,376
Roy?

192
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:02,456
Lin!

193
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,326
It was his idea.

194
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,926
- Chon!
- Clothes!

195
00:14:44,526 --> 00:14:46,186
Nice night for a walk.

196
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:55,936
Lin!

197
00:14:56,006 --> 00:14:57,476
- Lin!
- There you are!

198
00:14:57,546 --> 00:14:58,536
What are you doing?

199
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,276
Don't you know there's
a serial killer on the loose?

200
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:03,106
Forget it.

201
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,916
Who the hell are these guys?

202
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:13,926
Boxers.

203
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,426
What do they want with us?

204
00:15:15,496 --> 00:15:17,726
They're with me.

205
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:23,566
I think we need to have a little chat.

206
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:35,206
Chon Wang...

207
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:38,046
the man who can fight an emperor.

208
00:15:38,116 --> 00:15:40,776
The emperor should never have
his burial knife.

209
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:42,516
I see.

210
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:45,026
You're still my brother's lapdog.

211
00:15:45,086 --> 00:15:46,916
I'm here not for him.

212
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:49,816
I'm here for my father.

213
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,756
Of course you are.

214
00:15:54,896 --> 00:15:58,456
It was my dagger
that plunged into his heart.

215
00:15:58,536 --> 00:16:00,526
It's still crusted with his blood.

216
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:07,746
I know the boy has the seal.

217
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:08,976
Where is he?

218
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:10,136
We don't know.

219
00:16:10,216 --> 00:16:12,116
That's the truth...
we don't know.

220
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:14,016
Mmm...

221
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,486
What are you...
What are you doing?

222
00:16:21,396 --> 00:16:23,016
Stop! Put her down!

223
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,616
Put her down!
Put her down!

224
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,456
Or what, Mr. O'Bannon?

225
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,896
Are you gonna kick my ass?

226
00:16:29,966 --> 00:16:33,236
I've read all about
your ridiculous exploits.

227
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,736
I mean, just...

228
00:16:34,806 --> 00:16:39,076
how does it feel to kill
a mummy with your bare hands?

229
00:16:39,176 --> 00:16:41,336
Only a nation
of uneducated rednecks

230
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,046
would be amused by such cowboy drivel.

231
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:46,176
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy.

232
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:48,516
What's with the personal attacks?

233
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,286
You don't see me
making any comments

234
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,756
about your pasty complexion
or your snotty accent

235
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,846
or even your filthy, smutty sex books.

236
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:58,916
Yeah, I saw your book.
It disgusted me.

237
00:17:01,536 --> 00:17:03,966
Oh, why is it always the head
with you people?!

238
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:08,336
Hold it! Stop! Hold it!

239
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,496
Just hold it!

240
00:17:09,576 --> 00:17:12,506
What are we doing here?
Guys, look at this.

241
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:15,236
We're acting like animals...
over what?

242
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:16,536
Some seal?

243
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:19,176
The seal represents imperial power.

244
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:22,646
I will use it to unite
the emperor's enemies

245
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:25,686
and storm the Forbidden City.

246
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:27,186
What's in it for you?

247
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,486
You're looking
at the future king of England.

248
00:17:29,556 --> 00:17:31,456
You're, like, 20th in line to the throne.

249
00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:32,796
10th.

250
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:34,986
But my friend is about to change all that

251
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,436
by simple...
process of elimination.

252
00:17:42,606 --> 00:17:44,666
It's called a machine gun.

253
00:17:44,746 --> 00:17:48,046
The first of its kind...
it fires 200 rounds a minute.

254
00:17:48,116 --> 00:17:50,406
Testament to British ingenuity.

255
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,316
Oh, so you steal the seal,

256
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,476
and then you knock off nine royals?

257
00:17:57,226 --> 00:17:59,816
You got the short end
of that stick, my friend.

258
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:05,356
Dump them in the river.

259
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,666
Where are you taking her?

260
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:10,596
To make history.

261
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,866
I can already see the headlines...

262
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:17,106
"Nation mourns as Loony Lin
massacres royal family."

263
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:35,426
I need your assurance
that you will find the seal.

264
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,156
Don't concern yourself.

265
00:18:37,226 --> 00:18:39,216
My men are scouring the city.

266
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:44,356
You better pray they find it...
or our agreement is over,

267
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:48,806
and you will never get the crown.

268
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:58,276
Chon, I got a confession to make.

269
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,546
You are in love with my sister.

270
00:19:00,616 --> 00:19:02,606
Well, that, but...

271
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:05,416
I didn't lose all the money
on the zeppelins.

272
00:19:05,486 --> 00:19:06,886
No?

273
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:11,256
Nah. I blew most of it
on the Roy O'Bannon novels.

274
00:19:11,326 --> 00:19:12,816
I wrote them.

275
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,456
No, Sage McCallister wrote them.

276
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:17,726
That's what I'm saying, buddy.
I'm Sage McCallister.

277
00:19:22,706 --> 00:19:24,226
You wrote those lies?!

278
00:19:24,306 --> 00:19:26,206
I've always had low self-esteem.

279
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:27,746
How many books did you print?

280
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:29,976
I self-published probably a million copies.

281
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:33,016
We were actually second
to the Bible that year.

282
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:33,946
Oh, you...

283
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:36,146
I guess I'm just about
the worst friend

284
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,346
a guy could ask for.

285
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:43,086
No, you're a good friend.

286
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,256
Thank you.

287
00:19:44,326 --> 00:19:47,726
If you really love Lin,
I won't stand in the way.

288
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:48,886
Really?

289
00:19:48,966 --> 00:19:53,166
But if you break her heart...
I'll break your legs.

290
00:19:53,236 --> 00:19:54,396
That's fair.

291
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:59,136
Well,
friends to the end, Chon...

292
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,876
and this is the end.

293
00:20:05,616 --> 00:20:07,016
Chon, you got a plan?

294
00:20:07,086 --> 00:20:08,576
You wouldn't happen to have
a plan, would you?

295
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,676
Yes.

296
00:20:09,756 --> 00:20:11,546
- Anything I can do?
- No.

297
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,456
Good. I'll let you do
the heavy lifting, then.

298
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:31,276
Chon, hurry.

299
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:37,816
Chon!

300
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:38,936
Chon! Chon, hurry!

301
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:40,176
Hurry!

302
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,946
Hurry! Chon, hurry!

303
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:43,006
Roy!

304
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:48,356
Coming!

305
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,056
Chon!

306
00:20:52,396 --> 00:20:53,386
Oh!

307
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,286
The water's so dirty!

308
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,496
No! No! It's dirty! No!

309
00:21:26,266 --> 00:21:29,666
Just go ahead and drown me.
I don't care anymore.

310
00:21:33,436 --> 00:21:33,906
Roy!

311
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:35,636
You look ridiculous.

312
00:22:37,336 --> 00:22:38,826
I think we look good.

313
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:44,236
I really must protest
this intrusion.

314
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:47,436
Every bobby in London is out
scouring the streets

315
00:22:47,516 --> 00:22:48,446
for you two.

316
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,916
Have you been drinking?

317
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:53,346
I always drink when my
employment's been terminated.

318
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,476
They fired you?

319
00:22:54,556 --> 00:22:56,486
Lord Rathbone saw to that.

320
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:57,546
I'm sorry.

321
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,116
It's of no consequence.

322
00:23:00,186 --> 00:23:03,556
I never wanted to be
an inspector in the first place.

323
00:23:03,626 --> 00:23:06,066
It was my father's idea.

324
00:23:06,126 --> 00:23:08,326
I always wanted to be a writer.

325
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:10,526
Yeah.

326
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,366
Artie, we need your help.

327
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,996
Rathbone has taken Lin.

328
00:23:14,076 --> 00:23:15,536
He's gonna kill the royal family

329
00:23:15,606 --> 00:23:17,036
and he's gonna assume the throne.

330
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,576
Do you have any evidence

331
00:23:19,646 --> 00:23:22,666
to support these
preposterous allegations?

332
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,406
We have this.
It's the boy's.

333
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:28,246
Use your technique.
Tell us where he is.

334
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:32,686
Paraffin wax...
most interesting.

335
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,186
He's at a church.

336
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:36,056
The little punk's hiding
in a church.

337
00:23:36,126 --> 00:23:37,646
No, no, no.

338
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:39,666
It's not candle wax.

339
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:40,856
I have it.

340
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,436
- Don't worry. You'll get it.
- What are you doing?

341
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,436
- He's picking the lock.
- Well, hurry up!

342
00:23:48,506 --> 00:23:51,766
Chon, please! Please.
It's a very meticulous process.

343
00:23:51,846 --> 00:23:55,276
Let Artie do his job.
It's almost an art form.

344
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:57,476
It takes the precision
of a surgeon.

345
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,776
You have to be so precise.

346
00:23:59,846 --> 00:24:02,186
Maybe if we jam
another one in there.

347
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:08,186
That works, too.

348
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:10,456
Lacks a certain finesse.

349
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:16,196
All right, all right.
Let's split up.

350
00:25:22,866 --> 00:25:24,026
What the...

351
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,176
I am gonna break your neck.

352
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:31,036
Come here.

353
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:13,086
Looky here.

354
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:15,276
- Come on, where is it?
- What?

355
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:16,976
You know
what I'm talking about.

356
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:18,456
Don't give me that "what."

357
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,486
What do we got here?

358
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:22,216
Oh, yes.

359
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:25,656
You don't mind
if I take this back, do you?

360
00:26:25,726 --> 00:26:27,286
Go on.
Get out of here.

361
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:28,296
Go!

362
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:29,336
Roy?

363
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:30,596
I got it.

364
00:26:33,706 --> 00:26:35,366
Give me the seal.

365
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:38,506
Give me the seal!

366
00:26:51,056 --> 00:26:53,416
All right, spread out!

367
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,646
Through there!

368
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:57,356
Let's go.

369
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:08,526
The gig's up.

370
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,906
So, what are we gonna do?

371
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:23,986
Come on, think!

372
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:26,316
I'm not going
to an English prison.

373
00:27:26,386 --> 00:27:29,256
With my feathery blond hair
and Chon's athletic build,

374
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:31,256
they'll try to make us
the belle of the ball.

375
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,386
Forget it.
I'm not going back.

376
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,926
Well, at least we'll get
a good view of the fireworks

377
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,266
from Scotland Yard.

378
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,236
- Fireworks?
- Yeah.

379
00:27:41,276 --> 00:27:43,736
At midnight, they're launching
this huge display

380
00:27:43,806 --> 00:27:45,566
from a flotilla of barges
on the Thames.

381
00:27:45,646 --> 00:27:48,546
It's the official kickoff
to the Queen's Jubilee.

382
00:27:48,616 --> 00:27:50,516
Is the royal family gonna be there?

383
00:27:51,246 --> 00:27:54,016
They're gonna be viewing
the spectacle from a balcony

384
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,576
overlooking the river.

385
00:27:55,656 --> 00:27:57,616
He's got a machine gun on the barge.

386
00:27:59,486 --> 00:28:00,476
Yes.

387
00:28:09,496 --> 00:28:11,466
You gents lost your way?

388
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:13,096
Kid, tell me
you got a way out.

389
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:28,306
Nice move, kid.

390
00:28:28,386 --> 00:28:29,786
So why did you come back?

391
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:32,446
Why did you give up the seal?

392
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,786
'Cause I'm a fool.

393
00:28:38,526 --> 00:28:40,156
Guess I'm a fool, too.

394
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,386
Well, put her there, fool.

395
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,756
I never got your name.

396
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:46,966
Name's Chaplin...

397
00:28:47,036 --> 00:28:49,066
Charlie Chaplin.

398
00:29:49,566 --> 00:29:51,056
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

399
00:29:51,136 --> 00:29:52,226
Excuse me, please!

400
00:29:52,306 --> 00:29:54,136
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

401
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:04,036
You warn the royal family.

402
00:30:04,116 --> 00:30:05,136
I'll save Lin.

403
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:07,076
How on earth are you gonna do that?

404
00:31:34,506 --> 00:31:35,766
You okay?

405
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:43,246
I just saved you!

406
00:31:43,316 --> 00:31:44,406
You were late!

407
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:45,466
What?!

408
00:31:50,186 --> 00:31:51,346
Nelson?

409
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,236
Why are you hiding yourself
back there?

410
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:08,536
I shouldn't like to impede
your view, Your Highness.

411
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:10,466
Nonsense.
You arranged all this.

412
00:32:10,536 --> 00:32:12,406
You should have a front-row view.

413
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:16,006
I regret that, uh,
respectfully I must decline.

414
00:32:16,076 --> 00:32:18,746
I need to keep a good eye
on proceedings.

415
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,416
Whoo!

416
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,886
Nelson,
you've outdone yourself.

417
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:28,426
Wait till you see the finale.

418
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,386
Hey!

419
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,466
Hey!

420
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:44,796
Oh!

421
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:51,106
This is hopeless.

422
00:33:51,176 --> 00:33:53,106
We're not gonna get past the guards.

423
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:54,766
Well, not with that attitude we won't.

424
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,746
Come on, Artie.
There's got to be a way.

425
00:33:56,816 --> 00:33:58,806
There's always...

426
00:34:12,196 --> 00:34:13,556
Lin!

427
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:51,796
Yee-haw! Yeah!

428
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,566
Yee-haw!

429
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:55,036
Yee-haw!

430
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,736
We got to jump it!

431
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:51,556
Wu Chow!

432
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:10,446
Hold it right there,
Rathboner.

433
00:36:13,286 --> 00:36:14,776
I'm guessing
by your hasty retreat

434
00:36:14,856 --> 00:36:17,286
that you're still
20th in line for the throne.

435
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:18,586
10th.

436
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:20,986
Inspector Doyle, arrest this man.

437
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:25,686
He's got a gun!

438
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:27,356
Oh!

439
00:36:28,636 --> 00:36:29,616
Come on!

440
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:32,956
- Oh!
- You okay?

441
00:36:33,036 --> 00:36:34,296
What happened?

442
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:36,766
Rathbone nailed Artie
with a little sissy gun.

443
00:36:36,836 --> 00:36:39,136
I'll look after him.
You two go.

444
00:36:39,246 --> 00:36:40,976
Go!

445
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:50,406
For Father.

446
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,386
For Father.

447
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:54,186
For Old Man Wang.

448
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:01,486
Oh, my lucky playing cards.

449
00:37:09,576 --> 00:37:11,736
Be careful.

450
00:37:11,806 --> 00:37:14,646
Tell Rathbone to be careful.

451
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:16,676
Roy, let's go.

452
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,646
You're gonna need a bigger gun!

453
00:37:43,576 --> 00:37:44,936
You see him?

454
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:46,406
No.

455
00:37:46,476 --> 00:37:48,376
Show your face, Rathbone!

456
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:49,876
I'm gonna tear this guy apart.

457
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:52,346
Roy, you go this way.
I'll go that way.

458
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:55,076
Split up? I don't know
if that's a good idea.

459
00:37:55,156 --> 00:37:56,316
It's okay.

460
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,496
He's not up here.

461
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,826
Roy, keep going.

462
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:16,496
Aw, come on, Roy.

463
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,786
Hey, uh, Rathbone...

464
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:35,116
I was just thinking
of a title for my new book...

465
00:38:35,196 --> 00:38:38,886
"Roy O'Bannon vs. Little Lord Sissy."

466
00:38:38,996 --> 00:38:42,586
But what about "Roy O'Bannon vs.
The Man Who Would Be Queen"?

467
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:47,236
No sign of him, Chon.

468
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:49,466
The coast is clear up here.

469
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:56,666
Roy! Look out!

470
00:38:59,246 --> 00:39:00,306
Roy!

471
00:39:00,386 --> 00:39:01,646
Oops.

472
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:07,086
Come on up.

473
00:39:07,156 --> 00:39:09,286
I'll show you how your father died.

474
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:51,556
Lord, help me.

475
00:39:51,636 --> 00:39:54,226
Just let me know you're there.
Love me. Hate me.

476
00:39:54,306 --> 00:39:56,566
But let me know you're up there!

477
00:39:56,636 --> 00:39:58,906
Hey, I can see our hotel from here.

478
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,066
Wow.

479
00:40:12,986 --> 00:40:14,756
Come along.

480
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:16,556
I'm waiting.

481
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:19,856
Come on, Roy. Okay.

482
00:40:19,926 --> 00:40:22,026
Roy O'Bannon will not go quietly.

483
00:40:22,096 --> 00:40:23,426
You hear that, England?!

484
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:25,266
Throw whatever you want at me...

485
00:40:25,336 --> 00:40:28,266
your terrible weather,
your perverted killers,

486
00:40:28,336 --> 00:40:30,306
your Spotted Dick!

487
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,766
Roy, you're about to die.

488
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:11,316
You're on the minute hand of a clock.

489
00:41:11,376 --> 00:41:14,906
My life is flashing before my eyes.

490
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:17,976
Wait a minute.
I don't remember her.

491
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,566
One more.

492
00:41:49,786 --> 00:41:50,946
One more.

493
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:15,776
Oh!

494
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:22,106
How disappointing.

495
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:26,306
One more.

496
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:40,536
You killed my friend.

497
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:48,136
You killed my father!

498
00:43:07,896 --> 00:43:09,986
Roy!

499
00:43:10,066 --> 00:43:12,496
I thought you were dead!
Oh!

500
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:15,056
You think some tea-drinking psycho

501
00:43:15,136 --> 00:43:17,106
can take out Roy O'Bannon?

502
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:29,746
Whoa.

503
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,806
Easy there, cowboy.

504
00:43:35,096 --> 00:43:36,256
Huh?

505
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:55,706
You got any ideas?

506
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:57,266
Huh?

507
00:44:00,746 --> 00:44:02,876
- We jump!
- Jump?!

508
00:44:04,416 --> 00:44:05,786
You mean fall?!

509
00:44:05,856 --> 00:44:07,616
Aim for the flag!

510
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,286
Aw, shit.

511
00:44:10,596 --> 00:44:12,286
I got to tell you something.

512
00:44:12,366 --> 00:44:13,456
What?

513
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:16,426
You're the best sidekick
I could ever ask for.

514
00:44:16,496 --> 00:44:19,666
Thank you, Roy.
I feel the same about you.

515
00:44:21,006 --> 00:44:22,266
On three.

516
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:23,496
One...

517
00:44:23,576 --> 00:44:24,936
Two...

518
00:44:25,006 --> 00:44:25,736
- Three!
- Three!

519
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:54,106
Roy. Roy!

520
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:59,166
Howdy.

521
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:05,936
In recognition of outstanding bravery,

522
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:09,176
I dub you Sir Chon Wang.

523
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:16,626
For uncommon valor,

524
00:45:16,696 --> 00:45:20,126
I dub you Sir Roy O'Bannon.

525
00:45:25,536 --> 00:45:29,296
And for steadfast dedication to justice,

526
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:32,566
I dub you Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

527
00:45:37,876 --> 00:45:39,676
Arise.

528
00:45:54,496 --> 00:45:56,826
Who loves you, baby?

529
00:46:12,746 --> 00:46:14,906
Madam.

530
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:20,386
Artie, I bet Scotland Yard's
dying to get you back now.

531
00:46:20,456 --> 00:46:22,656
My official
crime-fighting days are over.

532
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:23,856
The queen has asked me

533
00:46:23,926 --> 00:46:26,226
to accompany the Imperial Seal
back to China.

534
00:46:26,296 --> 00:46:27,726
What a week.
Unbelievable.

535
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:29,736
She couldn't have picked
a better man, right, Chon?

536
00:46:29,796 --> 00:46:30,856
Yeah.

537
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:33,926
And the voyage is gonna give me
time to work on my new novel.

538
00:46:34,006 --> 00:46:36,236
It features a new kind of detective,

539
00:46:36,306 --> 00:46:39,276
and he's gonna solve crimes
using deductive reasoning.

540
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:40,936
Give me a name.
What's his name?

541
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:42,496
Actually, Roy,
I was rather hoping

542
00:46:42,576 --> 00:46:45,236
to call him Sherlock Holmes,
if that's all right with you.

543
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:49,346
I'd be insulted if you didn't use it.

544
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:57,496
- Ta.
- See you, Artie.

545
00:46:59,496 --> 00:47:01,826
That was very nice of you, Roy.

546
00:47:01,896 --> 00:47:04,196
I would've kept the name
if I thought it was any good.

547
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,856
It's a horrible name
for a detective...

548
00:47:05,936 --> 00:47:08,096
Sherlock Holmes. Holmes?

549
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:11,536
Will you stop playing with that?
I'm gonna smash it.

550
00:47:11,606 --> 00:47:12,836
I just want to see it for a second.

551
00:47:12,906 --> 00:47:14,936
- Just let me see it.
- No, you're gonna break it.

552
00:47:16,616 --> 00:47:19,046
It's just a rock
with some gibberish on it.

553
00:47:19,116 --> 00:47:20,606
That's Chinese.

554
00:47:21,486 --> 00:47:24,546
"Family is forever, my son.

555
00:47:24,616 --> 00:47:27,456
I'm proud
you cast your own stone."

556
00:47:28,696 --> 00:47:29,786
Wow.

557
00:47:29,856 --> 00:47:31,416
That's a good message.

558
00:47:38,436 --> 00:47:41,636
I'd like to cast my own stone, Chon.

559
00:47:48,346 --> 00:47:50,246
- Hi.
- Hi.

560
00:47:55,416 --> 00:47:58,546
I told you... the house
of O'Bannon will prevail.

561
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:06,626
Chon, I got a business
proposition for you.

562
00:48:07,296 --> 00:48:08,556
No more zeppelins.

563
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,426
No, no, this is much better
than zeppelins...

564
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:12,326
a new thing they're starting
out in California

565
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:13,836
called moving pictures.

566
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:14,896
Pass.

567
00:48:14,966 --> 00:48:16,526
Hold it. Hold it.
Hear me out.

568
00:48:16,606 --> 00:48:18,976
I really think these movies
could play to your strength.

569
00:48:19,046 --> 00:48:19,976
There's no sound,

570
00:48:20,046 --> 00:48:22,136
so we don't have to worry
about the language problem.

571
00:48:22,216 --> 00:48:25,976
And I think the kung fu stuff
could be huge.

572
00:48:26,046 --> 00:48:28,206
People are dying
for a good action picture.

573
00:48:28,286 --> 00:48:29,876
What do you think?

574
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:32,886
Chon Wang, movie star?

575
00:48:32,956 --> 00:48:34,386
It could work.

576
00:48:34,456 --> 00:48:37,726
I feel bad about ditching
that Chaplin kid,

577
00:48:37,796 --> 00:48:40,156
but we're gonna be running
and gunning in Hollywood,

578
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,696
and he'd just cramp our style.

579
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:44,896
It's such a tough town.

580
00:49:00,946 --> 00:49:03,386
Bloody tourists!

581
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:04,956
Action!

582
00:49:22,106 --> 00:49:23,436
You have to say "cut."

583
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,866
You just keep looking!

584
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:30,306
Ouch.

585
00:49:34,146 --> 00:49:36,746
Come here, you little minx.

586
00:49:36,816 --> 00:49:38,046
Cut.

587
00:49:38,116 --> 00:49:39,556
That was good.

588
00:49:39,656 --> 00:49:41,286
That was a good one, huh?

589
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:46,316
Maybe on this one
I should lick you... you think?

590
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,456
Like, after you lick me...
that could be kind of good.

591
00:49:49,536 --> 00:49:51,326
And, Jackie...

592
00:49:51,396 --> 00:49:52,526
Jackie?

593
00:49:52,606 --> 00:49:54,466
Thank you. Hi, Owen.

594
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:55,666
Hello. How are you?

595
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:58,176
Okay, and I'm not
Roy O'Bannon.

596
00:49:58,236 --> 00:49:59,366
Who are you?

597
00:50:01,046 --> 00:50:02,836
Damn it, Chon,
I think she's the one.

598
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,506
I know it's crazy.
We just met, but she's the one.

599
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:08,416
No, Roy,
she's my babysitter.

600
00:50:10,586 --> 00:50:12,176
Your babys...

601
00:50:12,256 --> 00:50:13,846
What?

602
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,356
Baby what?

603
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:16,586
Baby sister.

604
00:50:16,656 --> 00:50:18,186
Baby sister?

605
00:50:18,256 --> 00:50:20,526
Not babysitter.
Baby sister.

606
00:50:33,206 --> 00:50:34,366
You okay?

607
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:37,036
Action!

608
00:50:39,946 --> 00:50:41,476
What happened?

609
00:50:41,546 --> 00:50:44,176
Roy is the type of a friend
you never introduce

610
00:50:44,256 --> 00:50:46,986
to your other friends
or bring into your family.

611
00:50:47,056 --> 00:50:50,656
He's... Look at his eyes.
They're brown... full of shit.

612
00:50:50,726 --> 00:50:52,486
Always...

613
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:54,496
Just bullshit all the time.

614
00:50:54,566 --> 00:50:56,126
Yeah, have you ever heard of those?

615
00:50:56,236 --> 00:50:58,666
They're parents.
We have parents that love us.

616
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:01,166
You don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

617
00:51:03,076 --> 00:51:06,166
You don't...
We've got par... Yeah, parents.

618
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:08,676
Have you ever heard of those?
We've got parents that love us.

619
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:11,506
But you don't,
'cause you're a little orphan.

620
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:14,646
Oh, go on.

621
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:18,056
So mean.

622
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:21,356
Chon Wang, movie star?

623
00:51:21,426 --> 00:51:22,686
It could work.

624
00:51:22,756 --> 00:51:25,526
It could work.
You could do your own stunts.

625
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:27,356
What? My own stunts?

626
00:51:30,596 --> 00:51:32,536
Ow!

627
00:51:33,466 --> 00:51:35,126
Whoa! Whoa!

628
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:39,866
Stay here and be a good horsey
for the new sheriff.

629
00:51:39,976 --> 00:51:42,066
Ouch! Oh!

630
00:51:42,116 --> 00:51:43,876
Ow. That hurt.

631
00:51:47,386 --> 00:51:49,146
Ow! Ooh!

632
00:51:52,386 --> 00:51:53,586
Ow!

633
00:51:56,056 --> 00:51:56,986
Oh!

634
00:52:00,566 --> 00:52:02,726
You're supposed to catch me!

635
00:52:02,796 --> 00:52:03,956
Roy, catch.

636
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:13,406
- Jesus.
- That's my fault.

637
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:14,876
Wait a second.

638
00:52:14,946 --> 00:52:17,376
This nut is killing
your street women?

639
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:23,546
Who did that?

640
00:52:23,616 --> 00:52:24,606
Jackie Chan.

641
00:52:24,686 --> 00:52:25,676
Me?

642
00:52:25,756 --> 00:52:27,016
That's right.

643
00:52:28,256 --> 00:52:30,416
- That was the...
- First time.

644
00:52:30,496 --> 00:52:32,426
- The best take.
- I'm sorry.

645
00:52:32,496 --> 00:52:33,796
Hurry up!

646
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:35,526
Are you crazy?!
I can't do that!

647
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:38,036
This isn't Chinatown!
I can't sail through the air!

648
00:52:38,096 --> 00:52:40,036
- I'm not gonna break my neck!
- Roy!

649
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:41,396
What in our history together

650
00:52:41,436 --> 00:52:43,966
makes you think I'm capable
of something like that?

651
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:44,976
It's getting bigger!

652
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,136
There's got to be
a better way.

653
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:47,036
Roy!

654
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,546
Roy!

655
00:52:50,716 --> 00:52:53,206
My ass is on fire.
