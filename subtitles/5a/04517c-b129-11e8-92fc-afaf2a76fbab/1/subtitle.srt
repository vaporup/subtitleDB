1
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,967
Penthouse.
Office of the president.

2
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,917
Is Azae in?

3
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,920
Mr. Azae's secretary
is right through that door.

4
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,990
Thank you.

5
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,437
Hello.
I'm Richard Sumner.

6
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,439
Would you tell him
I'm here?

7
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,509
Mr. Sumner?

8
00:02:57,777 --> 00:02:59,677
Oh, Mr. Sumner!

9
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,612
I know Mr. Azae
is terribly anxious to see you, but...

10
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,615
What's the matter?

11
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:07,618
Well, excuse me, Mr. Sumner,
but you're a day early.

12
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,620
Your appointment
isn't until tomorrow.

13
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,520
Oh. Is this Monday?

14
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,525
No, sir, it's Tuesday.

15
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,527
And your appointment's
for Wednesday.

16
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,792
Well, why don't you just ring him,
tell him I'm here to see him.

17
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm sorry, Mr. Sumner,
but Mr. Azae isn't in yet.

18
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,802
Oh. Oh, well...

19
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,804
Oh, uh, w-where's
the research department?

20
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,965
I might as well
have a look at that.

21
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,476
Research and Reference
is on the 28th floor... that's 2809.

22
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,809
- Who's in charge there?
- Miss Watson.

23
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,814
Would you like me to
write that down for you, sir?

24
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,577
Sure, if you want to.

25
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,746
<i>2809.</i>

26
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,755
Miss Watson.

27
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,087
- You're left-handed.
- Yes, sir.

28
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,093
Office is all wrong for you.

29
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,095
Light comes from
the wrong direction.

30
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,165
Desk should be reversed.

31
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,734
<i>Wait a minute, sir.!
You forgot this.!</i>

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,878
Hold it, please.

33
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,880
Reference department.
Miss Costello.

34
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,882
- Peg? Cathy?
- Yes, Cathy.

35
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,385
There's a character named Richard Sumner
on his way down to see you.

36
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,115
Richard Sumner?
What for? Who is he?

37
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,124
<i>My other phone. I'll call you back.</i>

38
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,625
Thank you for waiting.

39
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,128
Is this the Society
for the Preservation of Eskimo Culture?

40
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,324
This is Miss Costello of the
Federal Broadcasting Company,

41
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,301
and I'm trying to find out the truth
about the Eskimo habit of rubbing noses.

42
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,372
Yes, connect me.
I'll hold on.

43
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,874
Reference department. Miss Blair.

44
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,876
Yes, we've looked
that up for you,

45
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,879
and there are certain poisons
which leave no trace,

46
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,609
but it's network policy
not to mention them on our programs.

47
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,617
Reference. Miss Saylor.

48
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,619
Oh, yes.

49
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:52,452
I called earlier about that little black
velvet strapless you had in the window.

50
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:57,393
Hello. I'm trying to find out the truth
about the Eskimo habit of rubbing noses.

51
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,466
That isn't very much
of a reduction, is it?

52
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,830
Well, do they rub noses,
or don't they?

53
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,666
But I saw an identical one for
ten dollars less in a store downtown.

54
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,742
Never mind.
I'll call the Explorers Club.

55
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:13,912
And will you call me back?

56
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:15,981
<i>Thank you.</i>

57
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,850
Reference department.
Miss Costello.

58
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,852
- Cathy again.
- Yes, Cathy?

59
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:24,354
- About this Richard Sumner.
- Yes? What about him?

60
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:27,358
I don't know exactly who he is.
Some kind of nut, I think.

61
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,792
Or somebody very important.
Probably both.

62
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:32,797
Do me a favor. If he leaves your place,
find out where he's going.

63
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,799
Azae wants to see him.

64
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,869
Sure I will, Cathy.
Thanks.

65
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,872
Reference.
Miss Blair.

66
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,875
Yes, just a moment.
I'll switch you to our baseball expert.

67
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,877
Peg? On two.

68
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:49,209
Miss Costello speaking.

69
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,715
The highest lifetime
batting average?

70
00:05:51,818 --> 00:05:55,151
Yes, that was held
by Tyrus Raymond...

71
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,551
Cobb...

72
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:00,587
with a percentage of.367.

73
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,662
No,.367.

74
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,731
Yes, I have that too.

75
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:11,736
He played only with the Detroit Tigers
for 21 years.

76
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,806
Mm-hmm.
You're quite welcome.

77
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:29,318
- Good morning.
- Morning.

78
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,951
- May I help you?
- No. No, thanks.

79
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,960
Interesting place here.
Do you mind if I look around?

80
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,689
Not at all.

81
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,265
- Make yourself right at home.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,282
- What do you suppose he's up to?
- Who is he?

83
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,784
Richard Sumner.
Azae wants to see him.

84
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,082
If he leaves here,
we're supposed to trail him.

85
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,157
- Where'd you get that?
- Cathy.

86
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,804
Catch anything?

87
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,959
Hello, Reference. Miss Saylor.

88
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,061
Oh. It's for you, Mr. Sumner.

89
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,063
Oh...

90
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,065
How'd you know my name?

91
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,067
Well, didn't you mention it?

92
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:52,069
- No.
- Oh.

93
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:54,071
Yes?

94
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,573
We've done a bit of juggling
with our appointments, Mr. Sumner.

95
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,201
Mr. Azae will be able
to see you today.

96
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,110
Well, just call me when he's ready.
I'll be right here.

97
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:04,183
Good.

98
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,184
Uh...

99
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:10,187
Would you hold this tape
for me, please?

100
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,190
35-24-35.

101
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,192
And very nice, too.

102
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:18,195
- I mean hold it against the wall, Miss...
- Miss Blair.

103
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,698
- This is Miss Costello and Miss Saylor.
- How do you do?

104
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,031
Over against that wall.
Would you mind?

105
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,104
All the way over.

106
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,504
- Here?
- That's it. Good.

107
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:34,879
What's it gonna be?
Midget golf? Snack bar?

108
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,881
Is Miss Watson in?

109
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,884
- Miss Watson?
- She's the head of Reference, isn't she?

110
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,887
- Yes. She just stepped out.
- You think she'll be long?

111
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:47,050
No. She's probably on the 31 st floor,
having a conference with her boss.

112
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,890
What did you want to see her about?
Maybe I could help you.

113
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,897
No, I don't think so.

114
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:56,901
Well, why don't you step in there.
You'll be more comfortable in her office.

115
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,766
Thank you.

116
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,518
What do you suppose he's doing
all that measuring for?

117
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,520
You think we're
being redecorated?

118
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,681
Does he look like
an interior decorator to you?

119
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,659
No! He looks like one of those men
who's just suddenly switched to vodka.

120
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,594
Morning, kids. Wait till you see
what I snagged at Bonwit's.

121
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,601
- Shh! Quiet!
- Here, take this.

122
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,603
- What the...
- Take it, and look busy!

123
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,105
- What's going on here?
- You've been in conference all morning.

124
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,107
- What's the matter with you?
- There's a strange character in there.

125
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,608
He's been waiting for you.

126
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,611
- What have I done?
- Bunny, you're late.

127
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,341
According to the grapevine,
Azae sent him down here.

128
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,679
And in case he's anybody that
can do anything to anybody...

129
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,619
Really, you girls kill me.
I was here until 10:00 last night.

130
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,622
This morning I had to go to I BM...

131
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,624
to see a demonstration
of the new electronic brain.

132
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,627
And on my way here
I stopped at Bonwit's.

133
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,697
<i>- So what am I gonna...
- Miss Watson?</i>

134
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,732
Speaking.

135
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,102
My name is Richard Sumner.

136
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,104
Well, numerologically,
that's very good.

137
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,606
There are 13 letters in your name.

138
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,610
- You calculate rapidly.
- Up to 13, anyway.

139
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,943
This is a nice, cheerful office
you have. Do you like it here?

140
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:19,950
Yes, I love it. If I didn't work here,
I'd pay to get in.

141
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,452
Are you from the story department,
Mr. Sumner?

142
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,455
No. No, I'm not.

143
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,787
I wonder if we could have
a little talk in your office.

144
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:29,520
- Certainly. Go right in.
- Thank you.

145
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,433
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

146
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:39,638
Yes, Mr. Sumner,
what can I do for you?

147
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,743
I didn't want to say anything
in front of your staff,

148
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,746
because every time I mention
what I do, people go into a panic.

149
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,748
Good heavens.

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,750
<i>What do you do?</i>

151
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,752
I'm a methods engineer.

152
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,822
Is that a sort of
efficiency expert?

153
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,154
Well, that term
is a bit obsolete now.

154
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,821
Oh. Forgive me.
I'm so sorry.

155
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,660
I'm the old-fashioned type.

156
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:11,430
I thought I knew everyone in this
building, but I haven't seen you before.

157
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:15,439
Well, I've only been around
a few times, just wandering about.

158
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,066
Oh, I see.
Sort of a migratory engineer.

159
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,077
Yes.

160
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,079
Excuse me, Mr. Sumner.

161
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,708
What would a methods engineer
be doing in our little iron lung?

162
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,719
Well, you'd be surprised how
a little scientific application...

163
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,721
can improve
the work/man-hour relationship.

164
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,724
Mmm. Fascinating.

165
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,726
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

166
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,728
And time is money, so they say.

167
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,798
Mm-hmm. So I've heard.

168
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,780
Green thumb.

169
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,510
Yeah.

170
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,717
Reference.
Miss Watson.

171
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,052
Yes. Yes, he is.
It's for you.

172
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,057
Oh. Thank you.

173
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:09,059
Yes?

174
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,061
Yes, I'm here with her now.

175
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,064
We're having
a very nice little talk.

176
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,568
Well, I haven't
got into that yet.

177
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,071
It's a little too soon to evaluate.

178
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:25,075
But I think we're thinking
along the right lines.

179
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:27,077
Yes.

180
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,080
All right, Azae.
I'll be up in a few minutes. Bye.

181
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,082
- Azae.
- Yes, yes.

182
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,085
I'll have to come back later,
uh, Miss Watson.

183
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,087
You'll get to Azae's office
much quicker...

184
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,089
if you use this back elevator.

185
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,159
Oh. Oh, thank you.

186
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:44,296
- See you later.
- Fine.

187
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,438
Hi. Cathy? Bunny.

188
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,441
Hey, what do you know
about a Richard Sum...

189
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:01,035
Uh, I'll have to call you back
with that information.

190
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,115
- Where the...
- Thank you.

191
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,183
- Uh...
- What's the matter?

192
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,686
Uh, l... I had a tape measure.
I must have left it here.

193
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,689
What did it look like?
I mean, any color?

194
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,691
No, just a plain, ordinary...

195
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,193
Oh, here it is.
Here it is.

196
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,195
Uh, sorry.

197
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,265
- Th-Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

198
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,891
Uh, I'll... see you later.

199
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,970
Fine.

200
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,573
What is it, Bunny?
Who is he?

201
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,576
<i>- What's he doing up here?
- Yes, what's he want, anyway?</i>

202
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,578
Uh, got a cigarette, Peg?

203
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,580
Sure. Why?

204
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,082
- Why not?
- You only smoke when there's a crisis.

205
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:41,085
Who is he?

206
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:44,088
- H-He's an engineer.
- No wonder he was measuring the place.

207
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,124
- Measuring?
- He had a tape measure.

208
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,125
- He taped the whole layout.
- He did?

209
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:50,593
Maybe we're getting
that air-conditioning, finally.

210
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,596
Hmm, that figures.
This is November.

211
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,258
Last August they were too busy.

212
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,097
Yeah, that's probably it.
Or something like that, anyway.

213
00:13:58,204 --> 00:14:00,104
<i>Your phone, Peg.</i>

214
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:04,040
Well, kids, what do you say we give
the company a little of our time?

215
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,544
- Got any memos you want me to check?
- There are a few, Miss Watson.

216
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,171
- I'll come out.
- Okay.

217
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,110
Here they are, if you would.

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,121
<i>I'd say the Times index for this.</i>

219
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,123
<i>The old Farmer's Almanac for this.</i>

220
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,125
If not, U.S. Weather
Information Service.

221
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,889
<i>But check the Farmer's Almanac first
and save time.</i>

222
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,964
This is from the Bible.

223
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,266
Book of Amos, chapter one.

224
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,393
Thank you.

225
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,147
Reference.
Miss Watson.

226
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,282
Yes, yes, I have that right here.

227
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,284
Certainly. It's no trouble.

228
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,786
"By the shores of Gitchee Gumee,
by the shining big sea waters,

229
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,290
stood the wigwam of Nakomis,
daughter of the moon, Nakomis."

230
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,293
Childhood? No, no.
That comes a little farther down.

231
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,295
"And he sang the song of children,

232
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,297
"sang the song
Nakomis taught him...

233
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,230
<i>"'Wah-wah taysee, little firefly,</i>

234
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,234
"'little flitting white-fire insect,

235
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,236
"'little dancing white-fire creature,

236
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,238
"'light me with your little candle...

237
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,241
ere upon my bed I lay me,
ere in sleep I close my eyelids"'...

238
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,243
Uh, you're welcome.

239
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,246
- Here's that $5.00 I borrowed.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

240
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:19,249
You can keep it if you need it.
I would gladly wait till payday.

241
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,751
On the shores of Gitchee Gumee.

242
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:23,754
James Whitcomb Riley.

243
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,756
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,

244
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,758
bless him.

245
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,261
I sharpened all your pencils, and
the new manila envelopes are in there.

246
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,263
Thank you, Ruthie.

247
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,766
I'll be glad to stay overtime any night,
if you have anything for me to do.

248
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,769
You're certainly ambitious.

249
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,772
Well, it was hard enough getting
this job, and I want to keep it.

250
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:44,274
Just get to learn
the reference library,

251
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:47,277
and I'll recommend you for a raise
after the first of the year.

252
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:49,677
- Thank you, Miss Watson.
- You're welcome.

253
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:03,185
Peg, I can let you have
that 10 you wanted now.

254
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,662
Well, whenever you're through,
come and get it.

255
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,666
Well, the, uh,
the physical setup is okay.

256
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,668
- There's plenty of room.
- Good. Good.

257
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,671
However, the nature of the activity
is such that the operation...

258
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,674
will be different than anything
that's ever been designed.

259
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,244
- It's a fascinating problem.
- Not impossible?

260
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,581
No, no, no, I don't think so.

261
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,914
No, we've made tremendous
strides in this field.

262
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,921
Visual read-offs
are all centralized, miniaturized...

263
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,254
and set on schematic panels now.

264
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,760
And then the... the data compiled...

265
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:39,763
is all automatically computed,

266
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,766
and there's an automatic
typewritten "panalog"...

267
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,769
- You see, sir...
- Now, now, now, please wait a minute.

268
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:49,398
I don't understand one word
you're saying, but it sounds great.

269
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,239
If you say it can be done,
that's good enough for me.

270
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,247
I'd like to hang around that department
for a couple of weeks, maybe a month,

271
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,250
and get a comprehensive
picture of its workings.

272
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,183
Well, that's easily arranged.

273
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,848
Get me Mike Cutler.
He's in charge of that department.

274
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,858
Uh, not Miss Watson?

275
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,862
- Well, she runs it, but he's her boss.
- Let's not bother with him.

276
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,023
Don't get me Mike Cutler.

277
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:17,034
Now, there's one thing
I want you to promise me.

278
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:20,537
Don't let the girls in Research
know what you're doing.

279
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,539
How's that?

280
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:25,542
I don't want them to know anything
about this big thing that's coming up.

281
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:28,044
It's vital that it be kept a secret.

282
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:31,878
Of course, it's almost impossible
to keep anything a secret around here.

283
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,544
So please, no matter what happens,

284
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:36,553
don't answer any questions.

285
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,885
What are they gonna think
of me hanging around there?

286
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,891
They'll think I'm a Peeping Tom.

287
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,893
I don't care what they think.

288
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,556
They're very smart, but this is
one thing I don't want them to know.

289
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,066
All right, all right.
They won't hear about it from me.

290
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,069
You know something?

291
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,230
This office is bigger than
the whole research department.

292
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,567
Well, it's supposed to be.

293
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:58,905
If the office of the president isn't
big enough to impress the sponsors,

294
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,447
then there's nothing for the girls
down in Research to research.

295
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,109
I have another office just like it
on the 31 st floor.

296
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,743
- You want it?
- No, no. No, thanks.

297
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:12,119
You don't care whether
you impress people or not, do you?

298
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,058
Wait until you get my bill.
You'll be impressed.

299
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,664
<i>It's on the desk, Peg.</i>

300
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,166
Thanks. Ooh, nice.

301
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,897
- Is it for an occasion?
- No... I don't know yet.

302
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:31,237
<i>It's for the dance that Mike is maybe
going to ask me to on the 12th.</i>

303
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:36,747
When, as and if Mike Cutler asks you,
do yourself a favor and be busy.

304
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:40,751
That's why he always waits till the last
minute... he knows you're always there.

305
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,253
- You mean I'm too available?
- Available?

306
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,256
You're like an old coat
that's hanging in his closet.

307
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,758
Every time he reaches in,
there you are.

308
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,887
- Don't be there once.
- He'd just buy himself a new coat.

309
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:54,397
He's been wearing this one
for seven years.

310
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,469
- What makes you think he won't anyway?
- Well, if he did, it...

311
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,604
That would be awful, wouldn't it?

312
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,537
Yes, it is. I know.

313
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,542
You go along thinking tomorrow
something wonderful's gonna happen.

314
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,544
You're not gonna be
alone anymore.

315
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,046
And then one day
you realize it's all over.

316
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,049
You're out of circulation.

317
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,712
It all happened, and you didn't
even know when it happened.

318
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,721
Well, when that day comes,

319
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,223
we'll move in together
and keep cats.

320
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,658
I don't like cats.
I like men, and so do you.

321
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,730
<i>Excuse me.</i>

322
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:28,494
Reference.
Miss Watson.

323
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,535
Bunny? Alice. Mr. Cutler's
on his way down to see you.

324
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,935
He is? Thanks, Alice.
Thanks a lot.

325
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,007
He's on his way down.

326
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,409
Where's my lipstick?

327
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,412
Darn!

328
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,414
Where'd it get to?

329
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,416
Peg. Peg,
where's your lipstick?

330
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,418
I'll get it.

331
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,420
No, no, wait a minute.
Here's mine.

332
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,080
Mike's on his way to see me.
Here's your dough. Get out.

333
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,419
See me payday.

334
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,426
- Did you hear anything I said?
- Yes, darling, I heard every word.

335
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,224
But I'm the faithful-as-a-bird-dog type.
I can't be devious.

336
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,231
All right, Lassie.

337
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,268
But when he disappears, remember,
you heard it on this channel first.

338
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,167
<i>Ohh...</i>

339
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,277
<i>- Hello, Bunny.
- Hello, Mike.</i>

340
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,951
Just a little something
I took out on approval.

341
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,490
I approve heartily.
Makes your eyes look green and sexy.

342
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,492
That's what the girl
who waited on me said,

343
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,494
but I thought she
was just trying to make a sale.

344
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,497
She was. She just happened
to be speaking the truth.

345
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,499
Mike, for the 500th time,

346
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:37,501
there's a glass wall behind you.

347
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,503
Who do you think you're kidding?

348
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,005
Everybody knows you haven't
got a brain in your head.

349
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,008
The only way you keep your job
is by being nice to me.

350
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,011
- Well, a girl has to work.
- Work? Oh, yes, work.

351
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,014
Bunny, take a look
at this financial report I drew up.

352
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:53,516
I didn't wanna turn it in
until you had a look at it.

353
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,018
Sure. I'd be glad to.

354
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,021
Take a look at projected expenditures.
See if they look all right.

355
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,023
Yes, I will.

356
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,958
I don't know how I'd manage
without you, Bunny.

357
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,962
I've missed you.
Feels like I haven't seen you in years.

358
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,964
A week ago Monday.

359
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,967
Well, the, uh, annual
board meeting is coming up,

360
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,971
and the boys upstairs have been moving
in on me, putting on the pressure.

361
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,473
Oh, it's just
their annual war dance.

362
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,976
I don't know why I get so nervous.

363
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,479
I've been here long enough,
you'd think I wouldn't let it get me.

364
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,880
Mmm. They do that to you.

365
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,313
- It's what I said before.
- Hmm?

366
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,322
Their annual war dance.

367
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:34,324
Oh.

368
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,690
Every year they have the same dance.

369
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,628
By the way, they're having that dance
at the country club on the...

370
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,824
12th. Uh...

371
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,493
You just happened
to mention it one day.

372
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:46,503
That's right.

373
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,505
Good memory.
You're terrific.

374
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:52,703
No, it's just that I associate certain
things with certain... other things.

375
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,711
I should have asked you sooner.

376
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,213
You didn't make
another date, I hope.

377
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,582
N... Uh... oh.
L- I'd better look that up.

378
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,756
- When did you say that was?
- The 12th.

379
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,325
That's on a, um, Saturday.

380
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,327
Mm-hmm.

381
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,660
Ah. As it happens,
I find I am free on that evening.

382
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,665
Good. Good.
Then you'll come?

383
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:17,667
I'd love to, Mike.

384
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,260
Oh, I'd better mark that down
so that I don't forget it.

385
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,806
Yes, you'd better do that.

386
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,904
We'll have fun.

387
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,981
Lots of fun.

388
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,917
Mike, if you don't get out of here,
I'll never get this done.

389
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,920
Yes, ma'am.

390
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,253
Give that a good going-over
and send it up this afternoon.

391
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,259
Or better yet,

392
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,329
why don't you bring it up?

393
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:49,558
I'll send it up.

394
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,069
All right. Don't forget, we'll drive up
to the club on the 11 th.

395
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,470
- The 12th, Mike.
- 11 th. You're coming for the weekend.

396
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:58,475
- I am?
- You are.

397
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,477
Oh.

398
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,740
Then if it snows,
we can get in some skiing.

399
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:06,147
And if it doesn't,
we can just sit in front of the fire...

400
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,786
and talk.

401
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,913
- Hmm?
- Mmm.

402
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:14,491
- Bye.
- Bye.

403
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:18,495
Bye, girls. Always a pleasure seeing
your freshly scrubbed, smiling faces.

404
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:23,296
Remember our motto: Be on time, do
your work, be down in the bar at 5:30.

405
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:28,636
Coffee break. Better hurry
if we want to get a seat.

406
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,412
Peg.

407
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,710
- Save a seat for me. I'll be right down.
- Okay.

408
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,651
Oh, Peg! He asked me!

409
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,653
Finally, he asked me!

410
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,155
Oh, Bunny! Bunny, I'm so glad!

411
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:50,160
- Did you set the date?
- Well, it was always on the 12th of...

412
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,162
- Date for what?
- The wedding.

413
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,165
What wedding?
He invited me to the dance.

414
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,168
For heaven's sake,
what'd you expect me to think?

415
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,603
"Oh, Peg, he asked me!
Finally, he asked me!"

416
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:05,233
Well, he also invited me
for the weekend, Peg.

417
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,244
Ladies and gentlemen, you have
just listened to another episode...

418
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,247
in the life of Bunny Watson,
spare tire.

419
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,249
<i>Ohh!</i>

420
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,047
<i>Ohh!</i>

421
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,721
Reference.
Miss Watson.

422
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:23,795
Let me jot that down.

423
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,397
Yes. Yes, I'm positive
we've got that.

424
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,468
Hold on a minute, please.

425
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:38,239
<i>Oh, dry up.!</i>

426
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,903
<i>I'll take the call.</i>

427
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,912
<i>- Who's that?
- Sumner.</i>

428
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,914
<i>Oh. Thank you.</i>

429
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,417
Hello. Reference department.
Sumner speaking.

430
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,320
I'm afraid Miss Saylor isn't here
at the moment. Can I help you?

431
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,458
What's that?

432
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,018
Uh, wait just a minute
till I get a pencil, please.

433
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:15,913
All right, shoot.

434
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,016
Well, l...

435
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:23,087
I mean, would you mind
repeating that?

436
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,487
39.95. Yes.

437
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:29,151
Reduced, yes.

438
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:32,594
Black velvet, strapless.

439
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,961
With what kind of a scarf?

440
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,402
Puce?

441
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,136
I know how to spell it...
P- U-C-E.

442
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,074
Right.

443
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:48,145
I'll tell her
as soon as she comes in.

444
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:12,535
Thanks a lot.

445
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:14,764
Miss Watson, w-who is this?

446
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,571
There she is.

447
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,577
<i>She's our trademark.</i>

448
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,170
<i>She's been with the company
since it first started 36 years ago.</i>

449
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,339
Huh.

450
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,178
I'm not surprised
you didn't recognize her.

451
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:28,184
- She's changed her hair.
- Aha.

452
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:32,188
Yes, I do have it. I'll send it down
by messenger. You're welcome.

453
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,191
Uh, Miss Watson,
are you free for lunch?

454
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:38,194
- Lunch? Me and you?
- Yes. Why?

455
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,788
Is there some company policy
that prohibits two people...

456
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,800
No. No, no, no.

457
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,462
Uh, I'll check
my appointment book.

458
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,038
Fine.

459
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,974
I just remembered.
I'm free.

460
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:54,204
Oh, good, good. I've got a lot
of questions to ask you.

461
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,213
Lunch is as good a time as any
to get 'em over with.

462
00:26:57,315 --> 00:26:59,215
- Quarter of one all right?
- Fine.

463
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,217
- I'll pick you up here.
- Good.

464
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,233
Say, Sadie, what time is it?

465
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,306
Oh. Hmm. Thanks.

466
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,719
- Hi.
- Hi.

467
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,221
- You being stood up?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

468
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,224
- All I know is, I'm starved.
- Good.

469
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,227
<i>If he takes you to the Pavilion,
try the chicken with truffles.</i>

470
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,229
<i>- I hear it's marvelous.
- Poulard truffee.</i>

471
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,232
I may eat myself
right into next week.

472
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,462
- Take your time. I'll mind the store.
- Okay.

473
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,573
Hello, Miss Watson.
Am I late? Sorry.

474
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,546
I was beginning to think
I'd misunderstood you.

475
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,552
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

476
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,054
Uh, tell me, Miss Watson,

477
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:15,058
what training
have you had for your job?

478
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,060
Well, a college education,

479
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,562
and after that
a library course at Columbia.

480
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:22,565
I was gonna take a PhD,
but I ran out of money.

481
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,568
Is this an interview? I mean, I would've
had my hair done or something.

482
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,070
No, no, no.
Just getting the vital statistics.

483
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,073
- Down?
- No, thank you.

484
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,075
Continue.

485
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,010
Well, my parents were both teachers
in the public school system,

486
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,013
so we didn't
have much money.

487
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,016
Um, I've read every New York newspaper
backward and forward...

488
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,018
for the past 15 years.

489
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,020
Mm-hmm.

490
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:47,523
I don't smoke. I only drink champagne
when I'm lucky enough to get it.

491
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,525
My hair is naturally natural.
I live alone.

492
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:52,027
- And so do you.
- How do you know that?

493
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,099
Because you're wearing
one brown sock and one black one.

494
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,800
You're right!

495
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,736
If you lived with anybody,
they would've told you.

496
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,537
That's one of the advantages of living
alone... nobody tells you anything.

497
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,612
<i>- Up?
- Yes, yes. Thank you, thank you.</i>

498
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,521
Nice place.

499
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:22,024
I found it the other day
when I was in the building.

500
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:26,530
- Have you been up here before?
- Many times... in July.

501
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:28,531
Lunch.

502
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,865
Now, we have, uh, roast beef
and ham and cheese.

503
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,371
- You can have your choice.
- Oh.

504
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,373
A picnic.

505
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:39,705
Ideal place for concentration.
Isn't it?

506
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:43,212
No waiters, no people, no telephones.

507
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,214
No central heating.

508
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,216
- Plenty of hot coffee.
- Mmm.

509
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,218
Have a seat.

510
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,288
Thank you...
Oh.

511
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,392
Now, I have a kind of
a personality questionnaire here.

512
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,395
Some of these questions
may seem a little silly to you,

513
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:02,898
but you'd be surprised what they
indicate about general intelligence...

514
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,901
and adaptability and so forth.

515
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,233
And they may also be a bit
of a tease for your memory.

516
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,566
Oh. A tease, huh?

517
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,904
Just answer the question,
you know, without, uh, dw...

518
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,707
- Don't dwell on the question.
- Mm-mmm. I won't.

519
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,715
"Uh, often when we meet people
for the first time,

520
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,275
"some physical characteristic
strikes us.

521
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,413
What is the first thing
you notice in a person?"

522
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,889
Whether the person
is male or female.

523
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,729
Uh, this is a little
mathematical problem.

524
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,732
Mm-hmm.

525
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,802
Oh, uh, celery and olives?

526
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,338
Four olives, three pieces of celery.

527
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,607
- Right.
- Uh-huh.

528
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,610
Uh, that doesn't happen
to be the question.

529
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,907
Oh.

530
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,916
Now, "A train started out
at Grand Central...

531
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,919
"with 17 passengers aboard
and a crew of nine.

532
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,752
"At 125th Street
four got off and nine got on.

533
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,692
"At White Plains,
three got off and one got on.

534
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:07,697
"At Chappaqua
nine got off and four got on.

535
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,699
"And at each successive
stop thereafter...

536
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:14,329
"nobody got off, nobody got on till the
train reached its next-to-the-last stop,

537
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:17,931
"where five people got off
and one got on.

538
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,942
Then it reached the terminal."

539
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,239
That's easy.
Eleven passengers and a crew of nine.

540
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,907
Uh, w...
That's not the question.

541
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,984
I'm sorry.

542
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,121
"How many people
got off at Chappaqua?"

543
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,191
Nine.

544
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,424
- That's correct.
- Yes, I know.

545
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:43,592
Uh, would you mind telling me
how you arrived at that conclusion?

546
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:45,601
Spooky, isn't it?

547
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:50,800
Did you notice that there are also
nine letters in "Chappaqua"?

548
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,139
Are you in the habit of
associating words...

549
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,802
with the number of letters in them?

550
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,814
I associate many things
with many things.

551
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,816
I see. Hmm.

552
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,651
Aren't you going to ask me how many
people got off at White Plains? Three.

553
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,724
But there are ten letters
in White Plains.

554
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,794
No. Eleven.

555
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,263
But only three got off there.

556
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:17,266
You see, I've only ever
been to White Plains...

557
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,529
three times in my whole life.

558
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:23,969
Well, supposing you'd
only been there twice.

559
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,976
But I wasn't.
I was there three times.

560
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:31,606
Aren't you gonna ask me
how many people got on at Croton Falls?

561
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:37,084
There is no Croton Falls
mentioned at all in the question.

562
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,248
No, but it is
the next-to-the-last stop on that line.

563
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:43,259
Anyway, one.

564
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:47,195
- Aren't you cold?
- No, no, don't worry. I never get cold.

565
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,860
Now, do you notice anything unusual
about the following sentence?

566
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,796
"Able was I, ere I saw Elba."

567
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,677
Um, no.

568
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,680
But...

569
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,751
I doubt that Napoleon
ever said anything like that.

570
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,056
Unless you mean because it's spelled
the same way backward and forward.

571
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,150
Is that what you meant?
What do they call it? A...

572
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,922
A palindrome.

573
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,397
Mmm. I know another.
"Madam, I'm Adam."

574
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,965
I doubt if he ever said that.

575
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,841
Now, I have
three telephone numbers.

576
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:37,073
I'm going to repeat them just once.

577
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,912
- See if you can repeat them after me.
- Mm-hmm.

578
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,987
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

579
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,923
Plaza 2-3391.

580
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,926
Hmm.

581
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,861
Murray Hill 3-1099.

582
00:33:52,964 --> 00:33:56,661
Plaza 2-3931.

583
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:02,038
Tough question?

584
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,341
Mm-mmm.

585
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,003
Tough roast beef.

586
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:11,946
Plaza 2-3391.

587
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,245
Murray Hill 3-1099.

588
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,321
And Plaza 2-3931.

589
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:25,156
Would you mind
telling me how you arrived at that?

590
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,994
First is Plaza 2 with
the year of the bank panic reversed.

591
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,330
The second one is Murray Hill 3...

592
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,099
with, uh, 33 years after
the date of the Norman conquest.

593
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,106
And the last one is Plaza 2...

594
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,108
with the number
the same as the first,

595
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,110
second and third digits transposed.

596
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,113
Except that there's something
terribly wrong with that question.

597
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:46,115
Mmm, really?

598
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,186
I don't think there is
any Plaza 2 exchange.

599
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,521
Mm-hmm.

600
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:55,990
"What, if anything,
is, uh, wron..."

601
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,291
- Well, I guess we can skip that.
- Mmm.

602
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,228
Whew.

603
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,232
Now, before asking you
the next question,

604
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,235
I must advise you
it contains a trick.

605
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:10,239
In order to see into the trick,
I give you two words of advice:

606
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,241
Never assume.

607
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,243
Don't worry. I won't.

608
00:35:14,345 --> 00:35:16,313
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,216
"A detective
broke into an apartment,

610
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:23,219
"found Harry and Grace
lying on the floor, dead.

611
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,221
Mm-hmm.

612
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:28,224
"Beside them was
a small pool of water...

613
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,726
"and some fragments
of broken glass.

614
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,228
"Above them, on a sofa
looking down at them, was a pet cat,

615
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,232
"his back arched.

616
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,735
"The detective concluded,
without further investigation,

617
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:43,170
"that the victims had died
of strangulation.

618
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,900
How was this conclusion possible?"

619
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,381
Never assume, hmm?

620
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:54,484
Never assume.

621
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:58,114
Yeah, well,

622
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,622
the only thing
I'm assuming is that, uh,

623
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,625
Harry and Grace were...

624
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,861
Hey.

625
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,863
Were Harry and Grace...

626
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,865
Oh, no, it's too silly.

627
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,935
Were Harry and Grace goldfish?

628
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:17,532
No. They weren't.

629
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,167
They were rare tropical fish.

630
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:21,745
Like you.

631
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:28,116
How did your machine
do on this test?

632
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,619
No machine can evaluate...

633
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,622
How'd you happen
to ask that question?

634
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,124
Oh, I did a little research on you.

635
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,127
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

636
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,130
You were born in Columbus, Ohio
on May 22. That makes you a Gemini.

637
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,133
You're a graduate of M.I.T.
With a PhD in Science.

638
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,136
You're a Phi Beta Kappa,
although you don't wear your key,

639
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,139
which means either
that you're modest or that you lost it.

640
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,141
You spent World War II
in Greenland...

641
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,644
working on something so top secret
that even I couldn't find out about it.

642
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:59,341
You're one of the leading exponents of
the electronic brain in this country...

643
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,477
and the inventor of an electronic
brain machine called EMMARAC...

644
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:07,490
the Electromagnetic Memory and Research
Arithmetical Calculator.

645
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,493
That's all I found out so far,
but I only had half an hour.

646
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,497
<i>A very rare tropical fish.</i>

647
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,499
Thank you.

648
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,504
Did you ever see
one of these electronic brains work?

649
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,506
- EMMARAC, for example?
- Yeah. Yeah.

650
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:26,509
Just this morning, as a matter of fact,
I saw a demonstration at I BM.

651
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,512
Oh? Did you see it
translate Russian into Chinese?

652
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,515
Yeah. I saw it do everything.
Frightening.

653
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,518
Gave me the feeling
that maybe, just maybe,

654
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,020
people were
a little bit outmoded.

655
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:41,523
Mmm. Wouldn't surprise me a bit
if they stopped making them.

656
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,065
Thanks, Don.

657
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:52,067
Hello, Smithers.

658
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,569
- Say, Miss Watson...
- How's everything in Legal?

659
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:58,574
You haven't been to see me for a
long time. Isn't there any new gossip?

660
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,236
None of the vice presidents
getting divorces or anything?

661
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,813
No. But I heard...

662
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,542
I heard something that
concerns you, personally.

663
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,243
- You did?
- Yeah.

664
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,515
You haven't heard I'm engaged
to be married, have you?

665
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,520
No! Are you?

666
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:17,526
No. And if you ever hear anything like
that, you come and tell me right away.

667
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,529
And be sure you get
the name of the man too.

668
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,531
I, uh...

669
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,534
- I was down in Personnel this morning.
- You were where?

670
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,536
- Personnel. On the ninth floor.
- Oh.

671
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,233
And while I was in there, they sent down
from Mr. Azae's office for your...

672
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,710
for your personnel file.

673
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,712
- They did?
- Yeah.

674
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,715
And you know, when they send
for those personnel folders,

675
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,048
it generally means
they're adding up the severance pay.

676
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,020
I didn't want to worry you or anything,
Miss Watson.

677
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,025
Oh. Oh, no.
I know you didn't.

678
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,028
- Just thought I ought to tell you.
- Yeah, thanks.

679
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,098
Yeah. Anytime.

680
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,639
I thought you'd never get back.
Do you know what Richard Sumner's doing?

681
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,643
Yeah. He's up on the roof
feeding the pigeons.

682
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:10,145
<i>- No, do you know what he's doing here?
- What?</i>

683
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,148
He's trying to replace us all
with a mechanical brain!

684
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,150
He's under special assignment
to Azae...

685
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,153
to see if EMMARAC
can be adapted to this department.

686
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,156
- That means the end of us all!
- Peg, Peg, calm down.

687
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,158
No machine can do our job.

688
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,820
That's what they said in Payroll.

689
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,330
- Did he design the machine in Payroll?
- Yes!

690
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,333
And as soon as it was installed,
half the department disappeared!

691
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:34,336
Well, the machine in Payroll
is just a calculator.

692
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,838
They can't build a machine
to do our job.

693
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:39,341
There are too many
cross-references in this place.

694
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:42,344
I'd match my memory against
any machine's any day, and yours.

695
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,347
Now, Peg,
the worst thing that can happen...

696
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:47,349
is for us to get panicky.

697
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,512
- So let's not tell Ruthie and Sylvia.
- Not tell them?

698
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,352
They're at union headquarters right now
to see if there's a law against this.

699
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:56,585
<i>There is a law against it.</i>

700
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,922
There's my phone.

701
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,297
- Don't lose it. It's my only copy.
- Yes, Miss Watson.

702
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,867
Thank you.

703
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:08,237
- Hi, Kenny.
- Hi.

704
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,239
Mr. Sumner,
here's that file you wanted.

705
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,242
They asked if you'd please return it
to Personnel as soon as you're finished.

706
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,312
Thank you.

707
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,430
Reference department.
Miss Blair.

708
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,932
Sylvia? Cathy.
Coffee break. Coming down?

709
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,934
Well, uh, no.

710
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,937
Not under the present
sign of the zodiac.

711
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,940
You see, uh, Gemini
is at war with Sagittarius,

712
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,443
and this means that all signs
are hostile at the present...

713
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:51,447
and continued alertness
should be the order of the day.

714
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,449
Oh. The brain is there, hmm?

715
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,451
Well, see you later.

716
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:58,522
You're quite welcome.
Call us anytime.

717
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,062
Costello department.
Miss Reference speaking.

718
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,067
I mean, Miss Reference Department.
Costell...

719
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,069
Oh, you know what I mean.

720
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,571
The traditional Thanksgiving song?

721
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,575
Well, one of them is
"Over the River and Through the Woods."

722
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,577
- Bunny.
- What?

723
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,581
Mike Cutler's waiting in your office
for you. With flowers, yet.

724
00:41:25,683 --> 00:41:27,583
- How do I look?
- Too good for him.

725
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,586
If any of you have questions,
you'd better get them together.

726
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:33,088
I'm leaving at 4:00
to have my hair done.

727
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,358
Oh.

728
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,360
Mike.

729
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,362
They're lovely.

730
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:42,364
You're an angel.

731
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,697
You'd, uh...
Better read the card first.

732
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:47,703
Oh.

733
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,705
- We're not going.
- I'm sorry.

734
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,707
And you're all packed too.

735
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:53,709
- Where?
- Chicago.

736
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:55,711
- When?
- Tonight.

737
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,474
When you work for a network,
you have to expect...

738
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:59,208
This sort of thing.

739
00:41:59,316 --> 00:42:01,147
Can't say I'm not used to it.

740
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,483
- We didn't make it last year either?
- Miami.

741
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:06,488
I remember
because you, uh...

742
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,820
you brought me back a bikini.

743
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,326
It was awfully flattering of you, Mike.

744
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:14,329
I'm sick about it, Bunny,
but I couldn't say to Azae,

745
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,832
"I'm sorry, but I can't go with you
because I have a date with Bunny."

746
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,335
- You're going with Azae?
- Uh-huh.

747
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,838
He could've asked Pendleton or North
or half a dozen other guys.

748
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:25,909
But he didn't. Just me.

749
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,910
I think you're moving up, boy.

750
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,913
Thanks to you. That financial report
had a lot to do with this.

751
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,415
I got quite a few compliments on it.

752
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,417
Remind me to louse it up next year.

753
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,919
Here.

754
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,923
For a rising young executive.

755
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,426
Bunny, why don't you drive
out to the airport with me?

756
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,428
Oh...

757
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,589
no, um,

758
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,599
I don't think so.

759
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,602
All those people
flying away, and...

760
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:56,264
me just sitting there, sitting.

761
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,273
No, I don't think so.

762
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:59,603
Well, I guess I'll...

763
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,701
I'll leave a light burning
in the window for you.

764
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:04,781
It won't have to burn long.
I'll be back before Christmas.

765
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,286
Look for me in your stocking.

766
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:14,783
- Bye, Mike.
- Good-bye, Bunny.

767
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,255
<i>Hey.! Let me out.!</i>

768
00:43:54,365 --> 00:43:56,265
<i>- Who's that?
- Sumner.!</i>

769
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:58,267
Oh, dear.

770
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,202
I didn't know you were still there.

771
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,535
I thought you'd gone home
hours ago.

772
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,541
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

773
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,544
I, uh, I got up there
behind the book stall.

774
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:12,104
I was reading.
I didn't realize how late it was.

775
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,551
Thanks.
Here, let me help you.

776
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,281
Oh, that's nice.
Thank you very much.

777
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:25,386
Oh. Good evening.

778
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,396
- Good evening.
- Hello, Smithers.

779
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:30,399
- Ah. Very pretty flowers.
- Thank you.

780
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,901
You going away for the weekend?

781
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,062
- No, just home.
- Oh.

782
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:38,733
I was going to wish you better weather,
but if you're just going home...

783
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,242
there's really no reason
to do so, is there?

784
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,590
Ohh!

785
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,594
- I'll get a taxi.
- Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Sumner.

786
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,529
- Which way are you going?
- 75th, just off Lexington.

787
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:04,533
Oh, well,
I can give you a lift, if you like.

788
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:07,035
My wife is picking me up
in the car.

789
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,038
Her mother came in today from
Chattanooga, and Myra had to meet her.

790
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:13,041
Oh, you sure
we won't be putting you out?

791
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:16,544
Oh, no, no, no.
We go across the Triboro Bridge.

792
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,740
- That'd be wonderful.
- Oh, there's Myra now!

793
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,817
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

794
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,819
Hey, Myra! Myra!

795
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,357
Bradley Smithers,
I've been around this block six times!

796
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:29,358
Hello, Mother Hewitt.

797
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,587
You don't mind dropping a couple
of my coworkers, do you?

798
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:34,858
- Oh, Brad!
- All right. Come on!

799
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,365
- This is Miss Watson.
- How do you do?

800
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:40,369
- Oh, then you must be Mr. Cutler.
- No. Sumner.

801
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,372
- Sum... I thought you told me she was...
- lxnay, ixnay.

802
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,374
Here, Mother.

803
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:48,377
Flowers! Oh, thank you, son!
They're lovely!

804
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,946
Oh, but, Mother...

805
00:45:58,522 --> 00:46:00,422
Here we are.
Here we go.

806
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,355
Here we go.
Here we are.

807
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,359
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much!

808
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,861
- Thank you, Mr. Smithers.
- You're quite welcome.

809
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,364
- And have a nice weekend.
- We'll have a lovely time.

810
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,366
- You too.
- Thanks. We will.

811
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,698
Good night.

812
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,704
- Wait a minute!
- What?

813
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,706
Wrong bag.
This is hers.

814
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:20,709
Oh, for Pete's sake! Billy, you gave him
your grandmother's bag!

815
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:23,211
- I'm awfully sorry!
- Here, take this bag.

816
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:26,714
- Terribly sorry.
- Close that door! We're getting soaked!

817
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,285
Oh, will you shut up!

818
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,623
Do you live
anywhere near here?

819
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:37,626
As a matter of fact,
I live a little farther up Lexington.

820
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,129
But I wanted to get out here
so I wouldn't spoil Smithers's fun.

821
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,634
No, it's full.

822
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:47,636
Darling, you'll never get a cab.

823
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,639
Maybe I can get one
up at the corner.

824
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,642
<i>We're gonna be the top item
on the Grapevine Gazette anyway,</i>

825
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,644
so come on up and eat with me.

826
00:46:55,746 --> 00:46:58,647
- Oh, no, I don't want to be any...
- Don't be silly. Come on.

827
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:01,582
- Sure it won't be any bother?
- Not a bit. Not a bit.

828
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,251
It's no trouble at all.
I have plenty of food in the freezer.

829
00:47:03,286 --> 00:47:04,818
It's no trouble at all.
I have plenty of food in the freezer.

830
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,015
Just put those down anywhere.

831
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,559
Ah, nice place.

832
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,062
You'll catch pneumonia if I don't
get you out of those wet things.

833
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,065
What would you suggest
I change to... your pajamas?

834
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,067
No, I have just the thing.
Come on.

835
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:22,070
It's not that I'm living with a man who
happens to be out of town at the moment.

836
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,073
It's just that I do
my Christmas shopping early.

837
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:28,667
Let me see.
One of these is a man's robe.

838
00:47:28,779 --> 00:47:31,043
Here it is.

839
00:47:31,148 --> 00:47:33,048
Ah, yes.

840
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:35,050
What's the matter?

841
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:38,053
I was just thinking
Smithers would love this.

842
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:40,055
You can change in there.

843
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,057
Try not to get it wet.

844
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,060
- I have to give it to somebody else.
- Yes, ma'am.

845
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:48,063
I don't know what we'll do
about your feet.

846
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,292
I didn't buy anybody slippers.

847
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,901
What about my galoshes?

848
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:56,598
<i>Goulash? Oh, great.!</i>

849
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:59,608
<i>- Mr. Sumner!
- Yes?</i>

850
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,043
Do you mind if I ask you
a very important question?

851
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,114
<i>No, no.
Go ahead.</i>

852
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:09,083
How do you like your chicken fried?

853
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,087
<i>I never heard of it
being made with chicken.</i>

854
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:15,215
<i>- What?
- Goulash.</i>

855
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:17,725
What about goulash?

856
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:19,728
<i>What did you say?</i>

857
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,731
I said, how do you
like your chicken fried?

858
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:26,234
<i>I said, I never heard of it
being made with chi...</i>

859
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:30,238
<i>- Are we going to have fried chicken?
- Yeah.</i>

860
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,241
<i>Oh, that's even better.
I like that better.</i>

861
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,243
Better than what?

862
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,245
<i>Goulash.</i>

863
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,748
Oh. Well, yeah.
So do I.

864
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,387
This dinner is white tie, isn't it?

865
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:47,389
White tie and bathrobe.

866
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,891
Now, how do you like
your chicken fried?

867
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:52,894
Well, salt and pepper mixed in
with the flour, throw it in a paper bag,

868
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,896
toss in the chicken, shake it up.

869
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,398
How would you like me
to show you how to make it?

870
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,627
I'd like it very much.

871
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:01,636
Right in there, off the living room.
I'll be right with you.

872
00:49:21,925 --> 00:49:23,893
Mmm.

873
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,364
Mm-mmm.

874
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,367
I'm sorry I can't offer you
any more chicken.

875
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,370
Next time, have three.

876
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:38,532
I must say, it's very special.
What's your secret?

877
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,873
Oh, a great chef never divulges.

878
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,710
There's another secret
that I'm much more interested in...

879
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,047
your report to Mr. Azae
on my department.

880
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,551
Don't know about that yet.

881
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,054
Then you admit that
no machine can do our work.

882
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,057
You and EMMARAC have something
in common... you're single-minded.

883
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,060
You go on relentlessly
trying to get the answer...

884
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:02,063
to whatever it is
you're trying to get the answer to.

885
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,065
What does she do when
she doesn't get the answer?

886
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:05,395
Mmm, very sensitive.

887
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,063
If she becomes frustrated, her whole
magnetic circuit is liable to go out.

888
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:12,300
Something like that is happening to me.

889
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:17,245
Say, do you smell
something burning?

890
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:20,748
No, no... Oh, I think
that's your kitchen.

891
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,251
- You need a new ventilator.
- Oh.

892
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,254
Are you serving dessert, ma'am?
And if so, what?

893
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,756
- I'm serving floating island.
- Floating island?

894
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,089
<i>Yeah.</i>

895
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,094
I wonder who that could be.

896
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,097
Uh, would you like me
to go into the...

897
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,599
<i>Oh, don't be ridiculous.</i>

898
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:40,602
We're a couple of adults.

899
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,400
- I'll get the dessert.
- Thank you. It's in the icebox.

900
00:50:48,645 --> 00:50:50,840
- Mike!
- Hiya, Bunny.

901
00:50:50,947 --> 00:50:53,643
Planes are all grounded.
How do you like that?

902
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,012
For heaven's sake.

903
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:59,248
- Raining here and snowing in Chicago.
- My, you don't say.

904
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:01,847
I know it's late,
but aren't you going to invite me in?

905
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,483
Oh, sure.
Sure, go on in.

906
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:09,054
Ah! Dinner and a fire going.
How lucky can a guy get?

907
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,070
You two know each other, don't you?

908
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:17,299
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

909
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,274
Just having dessert.
Won't you join us? There's plenty.

910
00:51:20,377 --> 00:51:22,811
- Just coffee.
- Sit down.

911
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:28,951
I'll, uh... I'll get another cup.
Won't be a second.

912
00:51:31,354 --> 00:51:34,721
I, uh, suppose I should
have called first.

913
00:51:34,825 --> 00:51:36,793
Yes. Do that next time.

914
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,262
Uh, did I miss something?

915
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,928
No, no, Mr. Cutler was saying that he
should have phoned before dropping in.

916
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,939
I said that I thought
perhaps he should have, too.

917
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,269
Thank you.

918
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:56,311
It never occurred to me
that anybody'd be here.

919
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,381
<i>Thank you.</i>

920
00:51:58,482 --> 00:52:01,781
Still, uh...
Still raining out, Cutler?

921
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:03,785
Why, Sumner? Are you
waiting for it to stop?

922
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:06,856
No. No, no. Sugar?

923
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,657
- Cream?
- No.

924
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,929
You know, being
this civilized is ridiculous.

925
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:21,629
I mean, this looks
fairly primitive to me,

926
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,435
unless, of course,
there's some other explanation.

927
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:30,878
- Other than what?
- Oh, uh, it's very easy to explain.

928
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,950
I hope so. It looks pretty odd.

929
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,849
I am beginning to get mad.

930
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:40,354
<i>You are beginning to get mad?</i>

931
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:45,087
What right had you to come barging in,
making noises like an outraged bull?

932
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:48,289
I wasn't making noises. I was thinking
them, but I wasn't making them.

933
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:50,696
- Well, they were...
- Oh, come on. Come on.

934
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,325
After all, it is
very simple to explain.

935
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,836
If there's going to be any explanation,
I'd like to get it from Bunny.

936
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,703
- Nothing here needs explaining.
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

937
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:01,709
I've never been in
such an idiotic position.

938
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,780
Now, after all, it was raining outside.
I got caught in the rain,

939
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:09,181
and Bunny... that is, Miss Watson...
invited me upstairs to get dry.

940
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:12,687
The robe is not mine. It was just a
Christmas present she happened to get...

941
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:18,250
for some fellow who has
the initials M. C... M.C.!

942
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,659
Well, like it?

943
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,995
I hope you do.
I can't take it back.

944
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:29,003
I embroidered those initials myself.

945
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,835
- You going to eat your floating island?
- I certainly am.

946
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:35,070
Mmm. Delicious.

947
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,371
- I don't get it.
- Absolutely delicious.

948
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,041
I don't get it.
You're not the Bunny I know at all.

949
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,551
No, I'm not.

950
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:48,955
You think I'm just an old coat in your
closet. That shows how much you know.

951
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,357
There's a constant stream of men
in and out of here.

952
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,361
I can't get them out of my hair.

953
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:56,591
<i>See? There's another one.</i>

954
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,363
Shall Cutler and I go into the bedroom,
or are we all three adults here?

955
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:04,429
<i>Oh, shut up. Come on in! Come in!</i>

956
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:12,645
Hello.
What are you doing here?

957
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,877
You're supposed to be
on your way to Chic...

958
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:18,511
I don't know what
you're supposed to be.

959
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,420
I got caught in the rain.

960
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,253
Well, I guess I better
put my clothes on.

961
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,660
I left them in the bedroom.
Oh, I'm sorry, Bunny.

962
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,733
As a matter of fact,
I left them in the bathroom.

963
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:39,501
- Peg, would you mind?
- Oh, not at all.

964
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,006
Do I smell something burning?

965
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,775
The kitchen needs a new ventilator.

966
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:55,385
I should've called before I dropped in,
but the last thing I expected...

967
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:57,517
If you're going on about how
the last thing you expected...

968
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,618
was to find me
with a man, any man...

969
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,560
Don't, Bunny. That's unfair.

970
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:05,226
If I thought like that about you,
why would I always be hanging around?

971
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,303
I'm kind of puzzled
about that myself.

972
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,771
- We've known each other for six years.
- Seven.

973
00:55:10,874 --> 00:55:14,207
And it's been a fine relationship,
no strings on either of us.

974
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:15,710
Yeah, that's for certain.

975
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:19,043
And I've learned to depend
on you for many things...

976
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,515
your warmth, your wit,
your understanding.

977
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:24,086
You've become a part of my life.

978
00:55:24,187 --> 00:55:26,815
That's why I want to ask you this.

979
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,193
What, Mike?

980
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:35,060
Don't let our relationship be destroyed
by what happened here tonight.

981
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,063
I was wrong in coming in like that.

982
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:42,104
I was wrong for taking it for granted
that you'd be here all...

983
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,470
No, I won't say that again.

984
00:55:45,575 --> 00:55:49,102
Look, let's not talk any more tonight.
I'll see you tomorrow.

985
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:53,080
Oh, come to think about it, I won't.
I'll be in Chicago.

986
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,152
Well, I'll call you
first chance I get.

987
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,624
- Good night, Bunny.
- Night, Mike.

988
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,475
All clear?

989
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:31,247
You can tell those five other guys
they can come out from under the bed.

990
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,323
- Who belongs to these?
- Ohh!

991
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,327
You do not need a new ventilator.

992
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,693
You don't know anyone
who would like to buy...

993
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:43,789
a man's robe with
the initials M.C.?

994
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,868
I'm selling one real cheap.

995
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,869
Will someone please fill me in?

996
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:52,374
Well, you see, Peg, it all started
with Mr. Smithers's mother-in-law.

997
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:55,706
She... She came up
from Chattanooga.

998
00:56:55,812 --> 00:56:58,508
It was Chattanooga,
was it not, madame?

999
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,449
- Chattanooga, Tennessee.
- Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1000
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:04,679
It was raining.

1001
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:07,757
There was a kid in the front seat
with a lollipop,

1002
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:12,954
a kid in the back seat
with a lollipop and a dog.

1003
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:16,031
And good evening.
I've had a lovely time.

1004
00:57:22,735 --> 00:57:25,966
<i>#Hark, the herald angels sing #</i>

1005
00:57:26,071 --> 00:57:29,563
<i># Glory to the newborn king #</i>

1006
00:57:29,675 --> 00:57:33,236
<i>#Peace on earth and mercy mild #</i>

1007
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:36,314
<i># God and sinners reconciled ##</i>

1008
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:38,645
Are you sure you want this mistletoe
right over the door?

1009
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:42,448
Certainly. Then if anything good
drifts in, we can grab him.

1010
00:57:42,554 --> 00:57:44,954
- Why don't you wear it in your hair?
- Along about 3:00, I may.

1011
00:57:45,057 --> 00:57:48,026
That's the spirit. Now, this may be
the last Christmas party...

1012
00:57:48,127 --> 00:57:50,857
we're going to throw here,
so let's make it a lulu.

1013
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:54,558
- Before lunch?
- Before lunch, for lunch, after lunch.

1014
00:57:54,667 --> 00:57:56,532
<i>What is the company policy
here at Christmas?</i>

1015
00:57:56,635 --> 00:57:58,535
Anything goes, as long as
you don't lock the doors.

1016
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:04,939
Reference. Merry Christmas.
Miss Costello.

1017
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:07,911
Yeah, sure, I can.
You got a pencil?

1018
00:58:08,013 --> 00:58:10,641
Would you please write it down
and file it away someplace?

1019
00:58:10,749 --> 00:58:13,149
Every year, you people ask
for the same information.

1020
00:58:13,252 --> 00:58:15,152
Dasher, Prancer, Dancer and Vixen,

1021
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:17,119
Cupid, Comet, Donder and Blitzen.

1022
00:58:17,222 --> 00:58:20,020
- You're welcome.
- They're running true to form.

1023
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:24,585
<i>About 4:00, they'll be calling up for a
complete text of A Visit From St. Nick.</i>

1024
00:58:26,131 --> 00:58:29,362
<i>- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas.!</i>

1025
00:58:29,468 --> 00:58:32,699
Ruthie, grab these before
I drop them all. Thanks.

1026
00:58:32,805 --> 00:58:36,332
Oh, the tree looks wonderful. I told you
the old-fashioned kind are prettiest.

1027
00:58:36,442 --> 00:58:39,240
That's the food,
and this is for laughs.

1028
00:58:39,345 --> 00:58:42,473
- I've had a couple of laughs already.
- Who hasn't?

1029
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:45,049
- More Christmas cards.
- Oh, thanks.

1030
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,677
Oh, hey. Wait a second.
From the reference department to you.

1031
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:52,746
Hey, thanks. Gee, thanks, everybody,
and Merry Christmas.

1032
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:55,326
- Same to you, Kenny.
- Wait a second, Kenny.

1033
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:58,055
- Did they give you anything in Legal?
- No.

1034
00:58:58,163 --> 00:59:00,631
Well, the mail boy we had last year,
I told him to go over...

1035
00:59:00,733 --> 00:59:03,429
and make a big show of what
we gave him, and it worked.

1036
00:59:03,535 --> 00:59:06,868
They met our figure.
Wait a second.

1037
00:59:06,972 --> 00:59:10,931
And do you have
a nice, crisp $5 bill?

1038
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:15,879
Yeah. Well, add that to it.
Catch on?

1039
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:18,677
Come back to our party later.

1040
00:59:18,784 --> 00:59:22,242
- Ladies, the cups!
- Happy New Year! The cups, the cups.

1041
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:28,014
<i>- Come on, Fred, hurry up.
- Go ahead. I'll join you down there.</i>

1042
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,095
<i>Right.</i>

1043
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,961
I'm expecting Miss Warriner
from my lab.

1044
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:40,834
She'll be asking for me. Will you send
her over to Reference when she comes?

1045
00:59:40,939 --> 00:59:43,339
Yes, Mr. Sumner.

1046
00:59:43,442 --> 00:59:45,706
I'll be glad to.

1047
00:59:45,811 --> 00:59:47,938
You ought to drink
a little something for those hiccups.

1048
00:59:48,046 --> 00:59:51,243
Thank you, sir.
I will.

1049
00:59:52,684 --> 00:59:56,142
Hey, wait a minute. I may need that.

1050
00:59:56,255 --> 01:00:00,453
Reference. Miss Watson.
Merry Christmas. Oh, yes. Indeed, I can.

1051
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:02,993
- Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen...
- Oh, no!

1052
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:05,461
Donder and Blitzen.
No. It's a pleasure.

1053
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,998
Give me my bottle, quick.

1054
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:11,467
What do you suppose it'll be like here
next Christmas when we're gone?

1055
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:13,470
Do you think EMMARAC
will throw a party?

1056
01:00:13,572 --> 01:00:16,200
Don't talk that way.
It's bad luck. It's Christmas!

1057
01:00:16,308 --> 01:00:17,536
It's Christmas.

1058
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:20,305
If we do get canned, we won't be
the only ones to lose our jobs...

1059
01:00:20,412 --> 01:00:22,312
because of a machine.

1060
01:00:22,414 --> 01:00:25,383
I understand thousands of people
are being replaced by electronic brains.

1061
01:00:25,484 --> 01:00:29,580
Hey! Look, this one's
from Mildred Pittinger.

1062
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:32,156
- She had your job, Ruthie.
- I know what it is.

1063
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,487
It's a picture of herself
and her husband.

1064
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:36,151
- Ooh!
- Oh!

1065
01:00:36,261 --> 01:00:38,229
- They had a baby!
- Oh, it's cute.

1066
01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,390
- All babies are cute.
- Let's drink to Mildred's baby.

1067
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,469
- Mildred's baby!
- Merry Christmas, ladies.

1068
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:46,697
<i>Merry Christmas.!</i>

1069
01:00:46,805 --> 01:00:49,365
Yeah, it is my great pleasure
to inform you...

1070
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:52,774
that the party over in Legal has started
and that you're all invited.

1071
01:00:52,878 --> 01:00:55,278
Let's go!
I love Legal. It's all men.

1072
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,109
- Shall we?
- I'll take my champagne.

1073
01:00:57,216 --> 01:00:58,843
They won't have any in Legal.

1074
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:02,409
# Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh #

1075
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:06,582
# O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way #

1076
01:01:06,692 --> 01:01:10,627
# Bells on bob-tail ring ##

1077
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:10,889
# Bells on bob-tail ring ##

1078
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:35,513
Hello?

1079
01:01:35,621 --> 01:01:39,113
Uh, Santa Claus's reindeer?

1080
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:41,351
Uh, uh, why, yes, I can.

1081
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,123
Uh, uh, let me see, now,
there's Dopey, Sneezy,

1082
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,496
Grouchy, Happy, Sleepy,

1083
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:51,796
uh, Rudolph and Blitzen.

1084
01:01:53,405 --> 01:01:55,737
You're welcome.

1085
01:01:57,342 --> 01:02:00,368
Oh... Merry Christmas.

1086
01:02:00,479 --> 01:02:02,947
Merry Christmas.

1087
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:07,007
I was in earlier asking for you,
but you were late this morning.

1088
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,019
I know, but it's all right.

1089
01:02:09,121 --> 01:02:12,750
I brought a note from my mother.

1090
01:02:12,858 --> 01:02:16,885
Nothing very much gets done
around here today, does it?

1091
01:02:16,995 --> 01:02:22,297
Oh, well, we never work here anyway.
This is our playpen.

1092
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:26,098
But if you're planning to work,
the budget is over there on the desk.

1093
01:02:26,204 --> 01:02:28,502
- Ruthie finished it.
- Thank you.

1094
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,075
You're welcome.

1095
01:02:31,176 --> 01:02:34,976
<i>If you're gonna read our budget,
why don't you let us read your report?</i>

1096
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,675
My report?
Oh, I've already sent that in.

1097
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:42,777
- Oh, have you?
- Uh-huh.

1098
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:49,293
<i>Oh, there you are.
I was looking all over for you.</i>

1099
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,862
I came in here
to find something.

1100
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:57,357
Oh, I remember what...
my other bottle of champagne.

1101
01:02:57,469 --> 01:03:02,270
If you take that champagne to Legal,
you won't even get another swallow.

1102
01:03:02,374 --> 01:03:04,842
That's right.
Maybe I'd better drink it right here.

1103
01:03:04,943 --> 01:03:06,911
- Join me, Peg?
- Certainly.

1104
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:10,709
How does champagne go with Four Roses,
scotch, Martinis and Bloody Marys?

1105
01:03:10,816 --> 01:03:13,614
Oh, fine. They're all
the same base... alcohol.

1106
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:17,086
Pull up a chair, Peg,
and rest your hands and face.

1107
01:03:17,189 --> 01:03:21,523
What year is that? "1947."

1108
01:03:21,627 --> 01:03:23,822
It was a good year.

1109
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:25,954
Not for me, it wasn't.

1110
01:03:26,064 --> 01:03:29,591
It was the year of the blizzard...
remember?

1111
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:34,104
I spent Christmas Eve
in a subway station at Canal Street.

1112
01:03:34,206 --> 01:03:37,403
Aw. Hey, you know,
that reminds me.

1113
01:03:37,509 --> 01:03:41,570
Just as I was getting off
the Mexican Avenue bus last night...

1114
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:44,979
What's so funny?

1115
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:51,988
The Mexican Avenue bus.

1116
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:55,617
You mean the "Mexington" Avenue bus,
don't you?

1117
01:03:55,727 --> 01:03:57,524
Ha! So I do!

1118
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:03,433
And here was this
brand-new Coupe de Ville...

1119
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:06,936
with the most attractive-looking
gray-haired man in it.

1120
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:11,442
And he slowly drove around
the block three times,

1121
01:04:11,543 --> 01:04:14,239
and I could tell by the way
he was looking at me...

1122
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:16,746
that if I had been
any other kind of a girl,

1123
01:04:16,848 --> 01:04:20,284
it would have been the start
of a very beautiful romance.

1124
01:04:20,385 --> 01:04:23,252
<i>More power to you.</i>

1125
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:27,485
You may be lonely,
but more power to you.

1126
01:04:28,794 --> 01:04:32,730
It has usually been my experience...

1127
01:04:32,831 --> 01:04:37,063
when a car cruises
around the block slowly,

1128
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:39,637
it has usually been my experience...

1129
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:42,639
that they are mostly
just looking for a place to park.

1130
01:04:47,913 --> 01:04:50,211
Peg...

1131
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,917
did you know that
our Mr. Sumner...

1132
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,478
also lives on
the Mexican Avenue bus?

1133
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:00,785
Oh, no.

1134
01:05:00,892 --> 01:05:03,861
Oh, Peg.
Peg, come...

1135
01:05:03,962 --> 01:05:06,362
Can't you just see him
standing there...

1136
01:05:06,465 --> 01:05:10,231
in his serape and bare feet,
holding on to the strap?

1137
01:05:13,672 --> 01:05:16,140
They're gone for the day.

1138
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:21,304
- Have some tequila, Peg.
- I don't think I should.

1139
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:24,814
There are 85 calories
in a glass of champagne.

1140
01:05:24,916 --> 01:05:29,546
Ohh. I have a little place in my
neighborhood where I can get it for 65.

1141
01:05:31,857 --> 01:05:35,122
Hey. EMMARAC.

1142
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:39,891
Would you stop fussing that budget
for a minute and answer a question?

1143
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:42,967
- Sure.
- Just for kicks.

1144
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:44,968
You don't have to answer it
if you don't want to.

1145
01:05:45,070 --> 01:05:48,198
I mean, don't dwell on the question,
but I warn you there's a trick in it.

1146
01:05:48,306 --> 01:05:51,002
If six Chinamen get
off a train at Las Vegas,

1147
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:54,977
and two of them are found
floating face down in a goldfish bowl,

1148
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:58,345
and the only thing they can find to
identify them are 2 telephone numbers...

1149
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:04,150
one, Plaza 0-0000,
and the other, Columbus 0-1492...

1150
01:06:04,256 --> 01:06:07,191
what time did the train
get to Palm Springs?

1151
01:06:07,292 --> 01:06:09,658
9:00.

1152
01:06:09,761 --> 01:06:12,787
Now, would you mind telling me
how you happened to get that?

1153
01:06:12,898 --> 01:06:15,025
Well, there are 11 letters
in Palm Springs.

1154
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:17,328
You take away two Chinamen,
that leaves nine.

1155
01:06:17,435 --> 01:06:20,632
You're a sketch, Mr. Sumner.

1156
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:22,866
You're not so bad yourself.

1157
01:06:22,974 --> 01:06:26,774
- Would you like some champagne?
- Thank you.

1158
01:06:34,019 --> 01:06:38,979
Just fill it right up to top.
Fine. Thank you.

1159
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:42,548
Now, drink it all down.
It's very good for you.

1160
01:06:42,661 --> 01:06:46,961
Oh, good. Now you can have
your Christmas present.

1161
01:06:47,065 --> 01:06:49,829
Here, from
the reference department to you.

1162
01:06:49,935 --> 01:06:51,800
Well, thanks.

1163
01:06:51,903 --> 01:06:55,270
Just a little something
we all thought you'd like.

1164
01:06:55,373 --> 01:06:57,500
It opens this way.

1165
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:03,477
Well...

1166
01:07:03,582 --> 01:07:05,914
Those are your college colors,
aren't they?

1167
01:07:06,017 --> 01:07:10,647
Uh-huh. Well, if I had known that,
I would have worn my freshman cap.

1168
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:14,247
- This is six feet long.
- Have you seen this, Peg?

1169
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:16,725
Yes. Just handsome.
Good wool in that.

1170
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:18,728
I really had to do
some stepping to find it.

1171
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,799
There doesn't seem to be much demand
for that kind of thing.

1172
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:25,358
- I don't know what to say.
- Just Merry Christmas is all.

1173
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,700
Merry Christmas.

1174
01:07:27,806 --> 01:07:31,765
And peace on earth
to men of good will, too.

1175
01:07:34,646 --> 01:07:37,376
- Bunny!
- Mike!

1176
01:07:37,482 --> 01:07:39,074
Uh...

1177
01:07:39,184 --> 01:07:42,642
<i>- When did you get back?
- Just got off the plane.</i>

1178
01:07:42,754 --> 01:07:45,314
I told you I'd make it back
by Christmas. Hiya, Peg!

1179
01:07:45,423 --> 01:07:48,984
Hi! The party started early this year.
The gang's over in Legal.

1180
01:07:49,094 --> 01:07:52,154
We'll see you. These presents
are for the office. Here.

1181
01:07:52,264 --> 01:07:56,030
Ooh! Thank you.
I'll put them under the tree.

1182
01:07:56,134 --> 01:08:00,093
- Hello, Cutler.
- Merry Christmas, Sumner.

1183
01:08:00,205 --> 01:08:02,070
Merry Christmas to you, Cutler.
I like that hat.

1184
01:08:02,173 --> 01:08:05,768
I like that suit.
You should wear it more often.

1185
01:08:05,877 --> 01:08:07,868
Aren't you going to
introduce me to Harvey?

1186
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:11,244
Oh, he's better
than Harvey. Watch.

1187
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:13,817
Mike, that's wonderful.

1188
01:08:13,919 --> 01:08:17,548
Where did you find it? Come on in my
office. I want to give you your present.

1189
01:08:17,656 --> 01:08:19,817
Act surprised.

1190
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:22,894
- Did you say something?
- Who, me?

1191
01:08:24,095 --> 01:08:26,962
Oh!

1192
01:08:27,065 --> 01:08:30,034
Good heavens and Earth.

1193
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:32,262
Here.

1194
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,533
Does, um, he hang around here
all the time?

1195
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,235
- All the time.
- Mmm.

1196
01:08:39,344 --> 01:08:43,440
Aw, no. Not today.

1197
01:08:43,548 --> 01:08:45,846
- To us.
- To us.

1198
01:08:48,053 --> 01:08:50,521
- Ahh!
- Here's yours.

1199
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:54,349
- Whew!
- Here's yours.

1200
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:57,758
- It's smaller. Open yours first.
- Should I?

1201
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:00,388
Oh...

1202
01:09:00,498 --> 01:09:03,467
Oh, Mike! The earrings!

1203
01:09:03,568 --> 01:09:06,128
Oh! They're so beautiful
with the ring.

1204
01:09:06,237 --> 01:09:08,762
- You like them?
- Oh, they're lovely!

1205
01:09:08,873 --> 01:09:12,502
- You like them?
- You are an angel. Oh, thank you.

1206
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:14,908
I can't give you yours now.
It's just too silly.

1207
01:09:15,013 --> 01:09:16,913
As long as it's not a robe.

1208
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:20,712
Well, it's as far away from a robe, Mike,
as I could possibly get.

1209
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:22,286
Thank you.

1210
01:09:25,123 --> 01:09:28,752
Bongo drums!
How did you know?

1211
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,887
There was a sign over them: "For the
man who has absolutely everything."

1212
01:09:32,998 --> 01:09:37,401
- Have I?
- Uh, has he?

1213
01:09:37,502 --> 01:09:39,868
- Bunny.
- Hmm?

1214
01:09:39,971 --> 01:09:42,235
I had a chance to do
some thinking in Chicago.

1215
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:45,434
- Did you enjoy it?
- Well, let's face it.

1216
01:09:45,543 --> 01:09:48,512
The whole company's had us
married for seven years anyway.

1217
01:09:48,613 --> 01:09:51,013
Well, they succeeded where I failed.

1218
01:09:51,116 --> 01:09:54,176
<i>Oh, go away.</i>

1219
01:09:55,887 --> 01:09:58,082
- I'm sorry, Miss Watson.
- Oh, it's you.

1220
01:09:58,189 --> 01:10:01,647
I guess your phone is out of order.
I've been taking your calls.

1221
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,287
There is someone called
"Take home the loot."

1222
01:10:05,397 --> 01:10:08,161
They would like to know
the name of Scrooge's partner,

1223
01:10:08,266 --> 01:10:11,099
uh, Scrooge's first name...

1224
01:10:11,202 --> 01:10:14,968
and how many brothers and sisters
did Tiny Tim have?

1225
01:10:15,073 --> 01:10:18,372
Oh, yes, and Azae's office has been
calling. They want you right away.

1226
01:10:18,476 --> 01:10:20,103
- When did they call?
- A few minutes ago.

1227
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:22,577
Why didn't you... Oh, never mind.
Take that, will you?

1228
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,808
- I'll see you later, Bunny. Dinner?
- Yes. Yes.

1229
01:10:25,917 --> 01:10:27,817
Good.

1230
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:38,928
#Jingle bells, jingle bells #

1231
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,998
#Jingle all the way #

1232
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:43,226
# Oh, what fun it is to ride #

1233
01:10:43,334 --> 01:10:45,962
# In a one-horse open sleigh ##

1234
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:57,279
# Oh, the beat-beat-beat
of the tom-tom #

1235
01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:59,816
#When the jungle shadows fall #

1236
01:10:59,918 --> 01:11:01,852
# Like the tick-tick-tock
of the stately clock #

1237
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:04,649
#As it stands against the wall #

1238
01:11:04,756 --> 01:11:06,724
# Like the drip-drip-drip
of the raindrops #

1239
01:11:06,825 --> 01:11:09,794
#When the summer shower is through #

1240
01:11:09,894 --> 01:11:12,727
#And the voice within me
keeps repeating #

1241
01:11:12,831 --> 01:11:16,995
#You, you, you #

1242
01:11:17,102 --> 01:11:21,004
# Night and day
da-la-dum-da #

1243
01:11:49,334 --> 01:11:54,271
- Bon voyage!
- Good-bye. Good-bye!

1244
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:56,840
Is this your first
Mediterranean cruise?

1245
01:11:56,941 --> 01:11:59,375
- Yes. But don't tell anybody.
- Why not?

1246
01:11:59,477 --> 01:12:02,446
- 'Cause I'm the captain.
- Oh.

1247
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:06,244
Well, I'll help you steer.

1248
01:12:06,351 --> 01:12:10,151
I'm independently wealthy, you know.
I've made this cruise often.

1249
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:14,954
Yes. Something about the way you wear
that pencil in your hair spells money.

1250
01:12:15,059 --> 01:12:19,587
Isn't money a lovely thing? I do hope
they don't take it away from us.

1251
01:12:19,697 --> 01:12:21,995
- Who?
- They.

1252
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:26,599
Would you like to sit down?
My deck chair is right next to yours.

1253
01:12:26,704 --> 01:12:28,865
Oh, I'm glad because
I've forgotten where mine is.

1254
01:12:28,973 --> 01:12:32,636
- It's right here. Right here.
- Thank you, skipper.

1255
01:12:32,744 --> 01:12:35,542
Oh, my!
What lovely steamer rugs.

1256
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,946
Tell me, skipper,
why have you never married?

1257
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:41,018
Don't you like women?

1258
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:46,614
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. I like women,
specifically as a sex and specifically.

1259
01:12:46,724 --> 01:12:49,352
But not "pacifically"
enough to get married.

1260
01:12:49,460 --> 01:12:51,189
Oh, no, no.
That's not it at all.

1261
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:55,790
I just never found anyone willing to put
up with me. Except Caroline, of course.

1262
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,926
- Would you like more champagne?
- No. What about Caroline, of course?

1263
01:12:59,037 --> 01:13:01,505
- Caroline... Caroline was a model.
- Mm-hmm.

1264
01:13:01,606 --> 01:13:05,633
- 5'10" in her stockinged feet.
- You had occasion to measure her?

1265
01:13:05,743 --> 01:13:07,643
Among other things,
yes, yes.

1266
01:13:07,745 --> 01:13:09,542
If it hadn't been
for the war, l...

1267
01:13:09,647 --> 01:13:12,548
Uh-oh. You got
a "DearJohn" letter.

1268
01:13:12,650 --> 01:13:15,210
No, no, no,
I got dozens of letters, but, uh...

1269
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,118
Imagine sitting on an ice cap
in Greenland...

1270
01:13:18,223 --> 01:13:21,386
and getting
a six-page letter telling me...

1271
01:13:21,492 --> 01:13:25,360
that the women's neckline was
going to go up the following year.

1272
01:13:25,463 --> 01:13:30,093
Now, if she'd told me that it was going
down, I might have had some reason to...

1273
01:13:30,201 --> 01:13:35,161
Then the next letter would be about
the hem skirt was going to be lower.

1274
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:39,539
I don't exactly look like a fellow who's
interested in women's fashions, do I?

1275
01:13:39,644 --> 01:13:43,102
Not even in men's.
Well, what did you do?

1276
01:13:43,214 --> 01:13:45,273
I had a friend who was
rejected by the Marines.

1277
01:13:45,383 --> 01:13:47,351
He had housemaid's knee,
or something was wrong with him.

1278
01:13:47,452 --> 01:13:49,750
Anyway, so I asked him
to look her up,

1279
01:13:49,854 --> 01:13:52,345
and, you know, keep her
from being lonely, and he did.

1280
01:13:52,457 --> 01:13:55,426
And then I got the "DearJohn" letter.

1281
01:13:55,526 --> 01:13:56,788
That was a dirty trick.

1282
01:13:56,894 --> 01:13:58,794
What are you talking about?
They're very happily married.

1283
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:02,161
If she never writes him a letter,
he'll never know the difference.

1284
01:14:02,267 --> 01:14:05,395
That's not why
you didn't marry Caroline.

1285
01:14:05,503 --> 01:14:07,562
The real reason is,
you're in love with someone else.

1286
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:09,299
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

1287
01:14:09,407 --> 01:14:11,773
- Who?
- Emily EMMARAC, that's who.

1288
01:14:11,876 --> 01:14:14,071
That monster machine you created.

1289
01:14:14,178 --> 01:14:16,476
You're in love with her.
She's all you ever think about.

1290
01:14:16,581 --> 01:14:19,277
- That's why your socks never match.
- My sock...

1291
01:14:19,384 --> 01:14:21,852
My socks match today.
Look.

1292
01:14:23,121 --> 01:14:25,021
Why, so they do.

1293
01:14:25,123 --> 01:14:30,083
Sure, and they have matched for
some time. You just haven't noticed it.

1294
01:14:30,194 --> 01:14:32,162
Oh.

1295
01:14:33,331 --> 01:14:36,300
- More champagne?
- No.

1296
01:14:39,003 --> 01:14:42,632
<i>- I'll bet you write wonderful letters.
- Bunny.!</i>

1297
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:46,369
<i>Bunny.! You're wanted
on the telephone.!</i>

1298
01:14:48,012 --> 01:14:50,674
You're wanted on the telephone.

1299
01:15:11,936 --> 01:15:15,303
- Reference. Miss Watson.
- Bunny? Cathy.

1300
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:21,003
Flash: Mike Cutler has just been made
a vice president. He's on his way down.

1301
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:27,047
Who made him a vice president,
Cath, you?

1302
01:15:27,151 --> 01:15:29,619
I should say not.
Mr. Azae did.

1303
01:15:29,721 --> 01:15:32,781
- Didn't he?
- He certainly did.

1304
01:15:47,972 --> 01:15:51,567
<i>Bunny.! Bunny.</i>

1305
01:15:51,676 --> 01:15:54,509
- Come in, Mr. Vice President.
- Isn't it great?

1306
01:15:54,612 --> 01:15:57,581
- You deserve it, Mike.
- Oh, Bunny, I could just take off.

1307
01:15:57,682 --> 01:16:01,379
When Azae started to talk to me
seriously, I thought, "You've had it."

1308
01:16:01,486 --> 01:16:03,716
The way things have been
so mysterious around here.

1309
01:16:03,821 --> 01:16:05,755
Then it turned out to be
a vice presidency.

1310
01:16:05,857 --> 01:16:07,791
Vice President in charge of
all West Coast operations.

1311
01:16:07,892 --> 01:16:09,052
West Coast?

1312
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,128
I've ordered two tickets.
We're finally going to take that plunge.

1313
01:16:11,229 --> 01:16:13,129
We leave Tuesday,
and be married on the coast.

1314
01:16:13,231 --> 01:16:14,528
This Tuesday?

1315
01:16:14,632 --> 01:16:18,193
- Sure. Why not?
- Well, for one thing, my apartment.

1316
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:19,530
Peg can take care of that.

1317
01:16:19,637 --> 01:16:21,935
Giving away apartments nowadays
is like giving away diamonds.

1318
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:25,008
Yeah, I know, but there's my job.
I can't just walk...

1319
01:16:25,109 --> 01:16:28,408
I'm a vice president. I transfer you
to the West Coast to take care of me.

1320
01:16:28,513 --> 01:16:30,481
- Anything else?
- What about the girls, Mike?

1321
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:34,039
I can't leave them, not when
they're so worried about their jobs.

1322
01:16:34,152 --> 01:16:37,485
Sorry. I can't help you there. I don't
propose to take them on my honeymoon.

1323
01:16:37,588 --> 01:16:40,489
But they're all invited out to visit us
next summer when we have our own house.

1324
01:16:40,591 --> 01:16:42,991
Our own house! Sounds good, huh?

1325
01:16:43,094 --> 01:16:44,994
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, nothing.

1326
01:16:45,096 --> 01:16:46,996
You threw it at me so fast,
I just can't think.

1327
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:49,498
<i>What's there to think about?</i>

1328
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,500
What do you want to do with your life?
Marry the Federal Broadcasting Company?

1329
01:16:51,602 --> 01:16:52,830
Well, don't shout.

1330
01:16:52,937 --> 01:16:55,428
I'm just trying to make myself
heard over those bongo drums!

1331
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:59,943
Who's playing them anyway?
Sumner, of course.

1332
01:17:00,044 --> 01:17:01,944
Who else?

1333
01:17:02,046 --> 01:17:04,947
- Well, what's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, Bunny.

1334
01:17:05,049 --> 01:17:07,847
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

1335
01:17:07,952 --> 01:17:11,581
When two people get married, they
don't worry about apartments or jobs.

1336
01:17:11,689 --> 01:17:15,147
I had every reason to think
you wanted this just as much as I did.

1337
01:17:15,259 --> 01:17:18,524
You had every reason to think
I wanted it twice as much as you did.

1338
01:17:18,629 --> 01:17:20,824
Yeah, but now you've changed your mind
for obvious reasons.

1339
01:17:20,932 --> 01:17:24,231
All that guff I swallowed
that cozy night at your apartment...

1340
01:17:24,335 --> 01:17:26,803
For the love of Pete,
I even apologized to you for that.

1341
01:17:26,904 --> 01:17:29,134
And now this l-don't-know-what-
you're-talking-about routine.

1342
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,403
I don't know what kind of a game you're
playing, but you've got the wrong boy!

1343
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,308
- Mike!
- And after seven years of waiting!

1344
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:40,146
<i>You waited seven years!</i>

1345
01:17:40,318 --> 01:17:44,311
Bunny, we're all being taken
to the Plaza for a drink by Richard.

1346
01:17:44,422 --> 01:17:45,719
Are we?

1347
01:17:45,823 --> 01:17:49,315
- She says yes.
- I'll meet you downstairs.

1348
01:17:49,427 --> 01:17:51,122
- Get your hat. You're going, too.
- Right.

1349
01:17:51,229 --> 01:17:53,527
- Here we go.
- Good. You all set?

1350
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:55,724
- Uh-huh.
- I'll get my packages.

1351
01:17:55,833 --> 01:18:00,293
Mrs. Smithers is going to drive us.

1352
01:18:00,404 --> 01:18:02,872
- Mr. Sumner!
- Oh, hello.

1353
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:05,442
- I'm Miss Warriner from your lab.
- Oh?

1354
01:18:05,543 --> 01:18:08,444
- You remember me, don't you?
- Of course I remember you.

1355
01:18:08,546 --> 01:18:12,414
I had the most awful time finding you.
Things are odd around here today.

1356
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:14,417
Uh, well, yes.

1357
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:16,987
As a matter of fact, Miss Warriner,

1358
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:20,387
I don't think it was a good idea
your coming here today.

1359
01:18:20,491 --> 01:18:23,016
What do you say we let this whole thing
go until after Christmas?

1360
01:18:23,127 --> 01:18:26,585
You'll get a terribly wrong
impression of the place today.

1361
01:18:26,697 --> 01:18:30,326
Oh, I can discount that. I'm just
interested in the physical layout.

1362
01:18:30,434 --> 01:18:34,097
We're going to be crowded in here.
We could move this desk forward.

1363
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:37,606
Or maybe leave it where it is
and I could use it for my punch card.

1364
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:40,643
Get away from this desk!
This desk is mine!

1365
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:43,270
What is this, Richard?
What's going to happen here?

1366
01:18:43,381 --> 01:18:47,010
Uh, well, you see, Miss Warriner
is an expert in electronics,

1367
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:49,143
and she'll be
in charge of EMMARAC.

1368
01:18:49,253 --> 01:18:51,244
She'll be installed here...

1369
01:18:51,355 --> 01:18:54,256
That is, of course, EMMARAC
will be installed here on Monday.

1370
01:18:54,358 --> 01:18:57,486
According to Mr. Sumner's figures,
it will save, in this department alone,

1371
01:18:57,595 --> 01:18:59,620
6,240 man-hours a year.

1372
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:01,960
How ingenious of Mr. Sumner.

1373
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:05,729
Why don't we all go over to the Plaza
and have that drink we were, uh...

1374
01:19:05,836 --> 01:19:10,136
Why don't you and Miss EMMARAC
go over and hoist a few?

1375
01:19:10,241 --> 01:19:12,266
<i>- Miss Warriner.
- Oh, I am sorry.</i>

1376
01:19:12,376 --> 01:19:15,174
- I have such a terrible memory.
- Really?

1377
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:17,907
And you chose to go into reference work
with a bad memory?

1378
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,984
Be careful. You're in
the major leagues here. Come on.

1379
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,255
Look, uh...

1380
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,591
And a very Merry Christmas to you, too.

1381
01:19:34,265 --> 01:19:36,165
Yeah.

1382
01:19:41,672 --> 01:19:43,799
Yeah.

1383
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:12,135
Somebody say something funny.

1384
01:20:12,236 --> 01:20:15,034
<i>I'll do it.</i>

1385
01:20:16,607 --> 01:20:18,575
Hello?

1386
01:20:20,978 --> 01:20:24,778
Yes. Yes, I can.

1387
01:20:26,017 --> 01:20:28,349
"'Twas the night before Christmas,

1388
01:20:28,452 --> 01:20:33,685
"when all through the house not a
creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

1389
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:37,750
"The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care...

1390
01:20:37,862 --> 01:20:41,958
"in hopes that St. Nicholas
soon would be there.

1391
01:20:42,066 --> 01:20:46,264
"The children were nestled
all snug in their beds,

1392
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:50,830
while visions of sugarplums
danced in their heads."

1393
01:21:26,410 --> 01:21:31,871
Good girl. Good girl!

1394
01:21:37,455 --> 01:21:41,721
Miss Costello, please!
These doors must be kept closed.

1395
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:45,227
You know how sensitive EMMARAC is
to changes in temperature.

1396
01:21:45,329 --> 01:21:47,695
So sorry. Here are the rest
of Bartlett's quotations.

1397
01:21:47,798 --> 01:21:50,926
Thank you. Ooh!
Everything's so dusty back there.

1398
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:54,163
One thing we don't like,
don't like at all, is a speck of dust.

1399
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:57,069
Do we, Miss Em?

1400
01:21:57,174 --> 01:22:01,133
- Here we are.
- Oh, the door. The door! Please!

1401
01:22:01,245 --> 01:22:05,545
- What about the doors?
- You must remember to keep them closed.

1402
01:22:05,649 --> 01:22:08,641
Emmy gets pneumonia in a draft.

1403
01:22:08,753 --> 01:22:11,313
Oh, Emmy.

1404
01:22:11,422 --> 01:22:16,883
Oh, please, Miss Blair, really!

1405
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,558
Well, if we do have to leave,
they're sure making it easy for us.

1406
01:22:28,606 --> 01:22:31,074
Doesn't Kenny usually
bring our paychecks earlier?

1407
01:22:31,175 --> 01:22:32,665
Yes.

1408
01:22:32,777 --> 01:22:35,871
- Why is he so late today?
- There's probably something extra in it.

1409
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:39,507
- Like a pink slip, so big.
- And it's very polite.

1410
01:22:39,617 --> 01:22:43,519
What it boils down to is, good-bye
and don't slam the door on your way out.

1411
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,691
Where's Emmy's mother?

1412
01:22:48,793 --> 01:22:51,591
She came in contact with Sylvia,
so she's out scrubbing up.

1413
01:22:55,332 --> 01:22:58,301
City Morgue. Can I help you?

1414
01:22:58,402 --> 01:23:00,802
Ooh! They hung up.

1415
01:23:00,905 --> 01:23:02,805
Ah, there you are.

1416
01:23:02,907 --> 01:23:07,310
The complete history of the American
buffalo. It, too, is becoming extinct.

1417
01:23:07,411 --> 01:23:09,379
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1418
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:13,940
- Well, Miss Em is ready to go.
- She's not the only one.

1419
01:23:14,051 --> 01:23:17,509
That's the little key that
fascinates me, this little red one here.

1420
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:22,251
- We try never to use that key.
- Why not?

1421
01:23:22,359 --> 01:23:26,318
It's too technical to explain to the
lay mind, but Miss Emmy doesn't like it.

1422
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:30,491
She's liable to act up and make a lot
of rude noises.

1423
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:38,104
Good morning, ladies. All you boys
know Miss Watson, of course.

1424
01:23:38,209 --> 01:23:40,404
Well, gentlemen, there she is...

1425
01:23:40,511 --> 01:23:42,979
EMMARAC, the modern miracle.

1426
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,605
Mr. Sumner, would you mind
explaining just...

1427
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:48,048
No, no. Not at all. Miss Warriner,
how's everything going?

1428
01:23:48,152 --> 01:23:51,178
Miss Emmy is digesting everything
just beautifully, Mr. Sumner.

1429
01:23:51,288 --> 01:23:53,051
Good, good. Now, gentlemen,

1430
01:23:53,157 --> 01:23:56,354
the purpose of this machine,
of course, is to free the worker...

1431
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:59,088
<i>- You can say that again.
- Uh, to free the worker...</i>

1432
01:23:59,196 --> 01:24:01,323
from routine and repetitive tasks...

1433
01:24:01,432 --> 01:24:03,366
and liberate his time
for more important work.

1434
01:24:03,467 --> 01:24:07,403
Now, for example, you see all those
books there and the ones up there?

1435
01:24:07,504 --> 01:24:12,203
Every fact in them has been fed into
Emmy. Now, what do you have there?

1436
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:14,277
<i>- This is Hamlet.
- That's Hamlet?</i>

1437
01:24:14,378 --> 01:24:17,973
- Yes. The entire text.
- In code, of course.

1438
01:24:18,082 --> 01:24:21,882
Now, these little cards
create electronic impulses,

1439
01:24:21,986 --> 01:24:24,921
which are accepted
and retained by the machine...

1440
01:24:25,022 --> 01:24:27,422
so that in the future
if anybody calls up...

1441
01:24:27,524 --> 01:24:29,287
<i>and wants a quotation from Hamlet,</i>

1442
01:24:29,393 --> 01:24:33,454
the research worker types it
into the machine here,

1443
01:24:33,564 --> 01:24:36,158
Emmy goes to work,
and the answer comes out here.

1444
01:24:36,267 --> 01:24:39,759
<i>- And it never makes a mistake.
- Well...</i>

1445
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:43,135
<i>Now, that's not entirely accurate.
Emmy can make a mistake.</i>

1446
01:24:45,009 --> 01:24:48,501
But only if the human element
makes the mistake first.

1447
01:24:48,612 --> 01:24:52,173
Tell me, Bunny, has EMMARAC
been helping you any?

1448
01:24:52,283 --> 01:24:56,083
Well, frankly,
it hasn't started to give yet.

1449
01:24:56,186 --> 01:24:59,883
For the past two weeks,
we've just been feeding it information.

1450
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:04,359
But I think you could say that it will
provide more leisure for more people.

1451
01:25:04,461 --> 01:25:07,658
- Thank you, Miss Watson. Thank you.
- Not at all.

1452
01:25:07,765 --> 01:25:11,257
Now, is there any question one of you
gentlemen would like to ask the machine?

1453
01:25:11,368 --> 01:25:13,563
- I have a question.
- Oh? What is it?

1454
01:25:13,671 --> 01:25:15,571
The spruce bud worm.

1455
01:25:15,673 --> 01:25:20,372
How much damage is done annually to the
American forest by the spruce bud worm?

1456
01:25:22,112 --> 01:25:24,945
- Ah, Miss Warriner?
- That took me three weeks.

1457
01:25:25,049 --> 01:25:28,883
I know. I know.

1458
01:25:28,986 --> 01:25:30,886
How much damage...

1459
01:25:30,988 --> 01:25:34,389
is done annually
to American forests...

1460
01:25:34,491 --> 01:25:37,358
by the spruce bud worm?

1461
01:25:37,461 --> 01:25:39,326
What was the answer,
Bunny? Remember?

1462
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:43,924
$138,464,359...

1463
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:46,229
and, uh, some cents.

1464
01:25:46,337 --> 01:25:49,465
Well, now let's see
what Emmy has to say.

1465
01:25:51,442 --> 01:25:56,778
$138,464,359...

1466
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,338
<i>and 12 cents.</i>

1467
01:26:00,451 --> 01:26:03,420
Now, how long did that take
your department, Miss Watson?

1468
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,011
Oh, 45 minutes.

1469
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:11,583
Well, even at that, you can see
that this one operation alone...

1470
01:26:11,695 --> 01:26:14,220
- saved your department 44 minutes.
- Good! Great!

1471
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:18,665
And now I want these men to see
the machine we've installed in Payroll.

1472
01:26:18,769 --> 01:26:22,728
Well, now, of course, that's an entirely
different operation, you understand.

1473
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:25,536
It's purely mathematical.

1474
01:26:25,642 --> 01:26:29,442
It deducts the income taxes,
hospitalization...

1475
01:26:43,394 --> 01:26:46,192
- Paychecks, everybody.
- Hi, Kenny.

1476
01:26:46,296 --> 01:26:48,423
- Hi.
- Thanks.

1477
01:26:51,635 --> 01:26:53,603
- Here you go.
- Mm-hmm.

1478
01:26:56,807 --> 01:26:59,935
Me. Ruthie.

1479
01:27:00,044 --> 01:27:03,172
Uh, Peg.
Sylvia.

1480
01:27:07,818 --> 01:27:11,811
Oh, who's afraid? Come on.
All together, hmm? Oh.

1481
01:27:17,461 --> 01:27:22,763
Huh. Not only that, they took out
for Blue Cross again this week.

1482
01:27:24,001 --> 01:27:26,902
Well, now that I've got it,
I feel better.

1483
01:27:27,004 --> 01:27:30,963
- At least I can stop worrying.
- Sure.

1484
01:27:31,075 --> 01:27:34,044
How long does it take before you start
collecting unemployment insurance?

1485
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:36,044
Two weeks.
I looked it up.

1486
01:27:36,146 --> 01:27:39,582
Let's not get maudlin. We'll show
this bunch. We'll open our own network.

1487
01:27:39,683 --> 01:27:42,345
It's gonna take a moving van
to get me out of here.

1488
01:27:42,453 --> 01:27:43,715
Help me, everybody.

1489
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:46,722
When I think of all the junk
I've collected in 11 years.

1490
01:27:46,824 --> 01:27:48,792
- I've got some cartons in the back.
- I'll help you.

1491
01:27:48,892 --> 01:27:51,520
Where to start?

1492
01:27:51,628 --> 01:27:54,722
All that stuff in the desk
is mine personally.

1493
01:27:54,832 --> 01:27:57,300
Oh, the coffeepot is mine.

1494
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:59,733
Those books on the top shelf,
I mustn't forget them.

1495
01:27:59,837 --> 01:28:03,136
- They're worth an awful lot of... Peg!
- What's the matter?

1496
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:05,401
My philodendron!

1497
01:28:05,509 --> 01:28:08,410
- What will I do with my philodendron?
- Yeah, what?

1498
01:28:08,512 --> 01:28:11,481
Maybe I oughta dump all the plant food
in and head it toward Emmy.

1499
01:28:13,083 --> 01:28:17,383
- Well, here we are.
- Oh, those are great.

1500
01:28:17,488 --> 01:28:20,946
Even if we do get other jobs,
we won't be together.

1501
01:28:21,058 --> 01:28:23,754
- I'll miss all of you terribly.
- Don't worry, Ruthie.

1502
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:27,262
We'll get together once a year
regularly, like the Ziegfeld girls.

1503
01:28:27,364 --> 01:28:29,832
<i>I'd like to see you get that
on the Lexington Avenue bus.</i>

1504
01:28:29,933 --> 01:28:33,733
I'll say it's alive
and pay an extra fare.

1505
01:28:33,837 --> 01:28:36,635
<i>Oh, there's my phone.</i>

1506
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:41,768
<i>So what?</i>

1507
01:28:41,879 --> 01:28:44,074
Shouldn't somebody
be answering the phone?

1508
01:28:44,181 --> 01:28:47,241
<i>Yes, dear. Go right ahead.</i>

1509
01:28:52,556 --> 01:28:55,024
Hello?

1510
01:28:55,125 --> 01:28:59,084
Huh?

1511
01:28:59,196 --> 01:29:02,996
Does the king of the what
drive an automobile?

1512
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:06,661
The Watusis. Would you mind
spelling that, please?

1513
01:29:07,905 --> 01:29:13,400
<i>W- A-T-U-S-l-S.
Oh.</i>

1514
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:16,035

1515
01:29:19,316 --> 01:29:22,774
<i>King Solomon's Mines?</i>

1516
01:29:22,886 --> 01:29:26,344
Oh, the tall natives
that were in the movie.

1517
01:29:26,456 --> 01:29:29,584
And you want to know if the king
drives an automobile?

1518
01:29:29,693 --> 01:29:32,821
Where would I find that?

1519
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:36,366
<i>Oh, the Herald Tribune.
Well, just hold on. Hold the phone.</i>

1520
01:29:36,466 --> 01:29:38,934
I'll get that for you.

1521
01:30:04,962 --> 01:30:08,864
Hello? Yes.

1522
01:30:08,966 --> 01:30:12,129
L- I don't quite...
Would you mind repeating that, ple...

1523
01:30:12,236 --> 01:30:14,704
Oh, Mr. Sumner, would you mind
taking this, please?

1524
01:30:14,805 --> 01:30:17,069
- I'm on the other phone.
- Oh. Sure. Sure. Where is everybody?

1525
01:30:17,174 --> 01:30:20,974
- Here we are, Mr. Sumner.
- Huh?

1526
01:30:22,412 --> 01:30:24,539
He... Hello.

1527
01:30:24,648 --> 01:30:27,776
What is the information you wanted?

1528
01:30:27,884 --> 01:30:29,852
Corfu?

1529
01:30:29,953 --> 01:30:33,116
All available statistics on Corfu,
Miss Warriner.

1530
01:30:33,223 --> 01:30:35,054
Yes, sir.

1531
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:38,457
We're getting that information for you.
Just hang on.

1532

<i>"The Herald Tribune, November 10, 1950,
page 39." What is this?</i>

1533
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:54,939
Oh, I had a question on the other phone
about the king of the Watusis.

1534
01:30:55,045 --> 01:30:56,842
That's wrong information.

1535
01:31:02,552 --> 01:31:05,953
Hello? Now, uh, what was
the information you wanted?

1536
01:31:06,056 --> 01:31:09,025
<i>Peg, Tribune index,
last four back copies.</i>

Sylvia, Corfu.

1538

<i>Well, as far as we know, it's the
Herald Tribune, November 10, 1950.</i>

01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:21,202
I'll tell you what

<i>a review of the movie
King Solomon's Mines.</i>

1541
01:31:24,574 --> 01:31:28,203
- The other phone, Mr. Sumner!
- Hang on. Hang on.

1542
01:31:28,312 --> 01:31:31,440
- What's the matter with everybody?
- As if you didn't know.

What... Hello.
Well, ju-just be patient.

1544

We're trying to get
the information for you.

1545
01:31:36,586 --> 01:31:39,111
Uh, hang on, will you?
Corfu, Miss Warriner.

1546
01:31:39,222 --> 01:31:41,520
- It's coming out now.
- Hang on. Hang on.

up with a whopping good picture."

1549
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:57,566
Yes. I could see
that picture again.

1550
01:31:57,674 --> 01:32:01,735
- This is the wrong classification.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1551

How are we doing on Corfu?

01:32:09,619 --> 01:32:11,678
Not "curfew,"
Miss Warriner, "Corfu."

1555
01:32:11,788 --> 01:32:14,416
I'm terribly sorry.
I didn't understand the spelling.

1556

Sylvia, give 'em Corfu.

1557

Albania near the mouth of the Adriatic.

Let's see what
little Emmy has to say.

1560
01:32:30,807 --> 01:32:33,275
- Hello!
- What the devil is this?

1561
01:32:33,377 --> 01:32:36,403
It's the poem,
"Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight."

1562
01:32:36,513 --> 01:32:39,482
Isn't that nice?
"Cromwell will not come till sunset,

1563
01:32:39,583 --> 01:32:41,551
"and her lips grew strangely white...

1564

curfew must not a-ring tonight."

1566
01:32:46,656 --> 01:32:48,556
- Mr. Sumner, what can I do?
- Nothing.

1567
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:52,287
You know you can't interrupt EMMARAC
in the middle of a sequence.

1568
01:32:52,396 --> 01:32:54,762
- Yes, but, Mr. Sumner...
- Quiet! Just listen.

1569
01:32:54,865 --> 01:32:57,493
"She had listened
while the judges read,

1570
01:32:57,601 --> 01:33:00,399
"without a tear or sigh,
at the ringing of the curfew,

1571
01:33:00,504 --> 01:33:02,972
Basil Underwood must die."

1572
01:33:03,073 --> 01:33:05,633
Uh, how long does this go on?

1573
01:33:05,742 --> 01:33:08,210
That old poem has
about 80 stanzas to it.

1574
01:33:08,311 --> 01:33:11,542
- Where are we now?
- "She has reached the topmost ladder.

"O'er her hangs the great dark bell,

"Lo, the ponderous tongue is swinging.
'Tis the hour of curfew now,

"Flash her eyes with sudden light,

- They hung up, and I know another one.
- I got it.

1584
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:43,508
"Out she swung, far out,
the city seemed a speck of light..."

King Watusi does drive
a specially built 1954 Pontiac.

1586
01:33:46,917 --> 01:33:49,818
He bought it with the money he got
making the movie. You're welcome.

suspended as the bell swung to and fro,</i>

1589

Good heavens!
What have you done now?

1590
01:34:01,264 --> 01:34:04,495
- I don't know! I don't know!
- There, now, calm down.

1591
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:07,570
You know you have to tell me.
L- I can't fix it unless I know...

1592
01:34:07,671 --> 01:34:09,798
I don't know what I did!
I don't know.

1593
01:34:09,906 --> 01:34:13,205
- It's your machine, not mine!
- Is this supposed to be smoldering?

1594
01:34:13,310 --> 01:34:17,110
- Don't you touch that machine!
- Now, now, stop crying.

1595
01:34:17,214 --> 01:34:20,183
Crying won't help it
just because you made a stupid mistake.

1596
01:34:20,283 --> 01:34:23,650
- Stupid?
- Yes. Or asinine, if you prefer.

1597
01:34:23,753 --> 01:34:26,221
There's nothing wrong
between me and EMMARAC.

1598
01:34:26,323 --> 01:34:29,918
Ever since I got here, you've done
nothing but try to sabotage me!

1599
01:34:30,026 --> 01:34:31,254
You all hate me!

1600
01:34:31,361 --> 01:34:35,024
I've been forced to work in an
atmosphere of hatred and suspicion!

1601
01:34:35,131 --> 01:34:37,156
It's all your doing.
You did it!

1602
01:34:37,267 --> 01:34:40,566
You did it, and you're
just as bad as they are!

1603
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:44,629
I don't know what I did to the machine!
At this point, I don't care!

1604
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:49,638
I have to stop this thing
and try to figure out what she did.

1605
01:34:49,746 --> 01:34:51,373
Would this have something
to do with it?

1606
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:53,005
Yes. Yes. Thanks.

1607
01:34:53,116 --> 01:34:57,212
- Has anybody got a little piece of wire?
- How about this?

1608
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:00,585
Oh, that's fine. Fine. Thank you.

1609
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:03,591
I hope he can't fix it.

1610
01:35:13,904 --> 01:35:17,032
Peace.
It's wonderful.

1611
01:35:17,207 --> 01:35:20,267
The human element...
entirely unpredictable.

1612
01:35:20,377 --> 01:35:23,437
- Mr. Sumner, this is for you.
- Me?

1613
01:35:23,547 --> 01:35:26,675
Sign here, please.

1614
01:35:26,783 --> 01:35:30,514
Well, this is my last pickup.
So I'd better say good-bye.

1615
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,180
<i>Oh, Kenny, not you, too!</i>

1616
01:35:33,290 --> 01:35:36,418
Did you invent some kind of
a machine that carries mail?

1617
01:35:36,526 --> 01:35:39,654
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1618
01:35:39,763 --> 01:35:41,663
Isn't anybody going to
answer a telephone?

1619
01:35:41,765 --> 01:35:44,928
- You forget. We don't work here anymore.
- You don't work here?

1620
01:35:45,035 --> 01:35:46,764
I don't understand.
What did you do?

1621
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:49,338
- Somebody hand me a blunt instrument.
- What did we do?

1622
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:53,773
"Good night, sweet prince."

1623
01:35:53,877 --> 01:35:56,778
I'm not even on the payroll!

1624
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,370
Wait, let me get this stra...

1625
01:35:58,481 --> 01:36:00,642
- Did you all get fired?
- Right.

1626
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:03,014
- Why?
- Why? Why, indeed.

1627
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,349
<i>I can tell you what the grapevine says.</i>

1628
01:36:05,455 --> 01:36:07,980
- It's that big merger.
- What do you know about the merger?

1629
01:36:08,091 --> 01:36:11,254
It's in the afternoon paper.
We're joining with the Atlantic Network.

1630
01:36:11,361 --> 01:36:14,228
- So they're letting most of us out.
- I know all about the merger.

1631
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:17,300
That wasn't meant to have people fired.
It was supposed to do just the opposite!

1632
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,665
What?

1633
01:36:22,539 --> 01:36:25,940
Hello. Get off this line, will ya?
It's urgent. This is Mr. Sumner.

1634
01:36:26,042 --> 01:36:28,840
- I want to speak to Azae.
- You want to talk to Mr. Azae?

1635
01:36:28,945 --> 01:36:32,278
He's been trying to reach you! What's
the matter with everyone down there?

1636
01:36:32,382 --> 01:36:36,512
- Yes?
- Azae, you broke a promise to me.

1637
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,781
Do you know everybody
down here in Research has been fired?

1638
01:36:38,888 --> 01:36:41,448
The whole darn building's been fired!

1639
01:36:41,558 --> 01:36:45,585
That crazy fool machine of yours
in Payroll went berserk this morning...

1640
01:36:45,695 --> 01:36:47,560
and gave everybody a pink slip!

1641
01:36:47,664 --> 01:36:50,827
No kidding.
Oh, but that... that's impossible.

1642
01:36:50,934 --> 01:36:53,129
It's impos...
It just couldn't happen.

1643
01:36:53,236 --> 01:36:55,704
All right. Sure.
Sure. Right away.

1644
01:36:55,805 --> 01:36:59,104
- What? What?
- EMMARAC down in Payroll. Mistake.

1645
01:36:59,209 --> 01:37:01,734
- What mistake?
- It fired everybody in the building.

1646
01:37:01,845 --> 01:37:04,313
- Some mistake!
- You mean we're not really fired?

1647
01:37:04,414 --> 01:37:06,678
- No, nobody's fired.
- Oh, boy, was that a close shave!

1648
01:37:06,783 --> 01:37:09,251
If we're not fired, what's going to
happen when EMMARAC takes over?

1649
01:37:09,352 --> 01:37:11,547
- Yes, what?
- EMMARAC is not going to take over.

1650
01:37:11,655 --> 01:37:14,624
It was never intended to take over.
It was never intended to replace you.

1651
01:37:14,724 --> 01:37:17,386
It's here to free your time for research.
It's here to help you.

1652
01:37:17,494 --> 01:37:20,725
- Why didn't you say so?
- Because of your darn grapevine.

1653
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,924
They didn't want that Atlantic stock
to go up while the merger was going.

1654
01:37:24,034 --> 01:37:26,935
There's going to be more work here
than ever before.

1655
01:37:27,037 --> 01:37:30,734
They're putting on a few more girls.
I hope they're as good as you are.

1656
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:34,571
- Moral: Never assume.
- We'll put your stuff back.

1657
01:37:37,514 --> 01:37:40,415
Reference.
Miss Watson speaking.

1658
01:37:40,517 --> 01:37:44,317
What? Uh, purely theoretical,
of course.

1659
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:47,618
- What? What?
- What is the total weight of the Earth?

1660
01:37:47,724 --> 01:37:51,854
- Who wants to know?
- Who wants to know? Promotion.

1661
01:37:51,961 --> 01:37:54,759
Well, that's the sort of thing
you can spend months finding.

1662
01:37:59,436 --> 01:38:01,597
Might as well give her a crack at it.

1663
01:38:01,705 --> 01:38:03,605
- Tell him you'll call him back.
- Call you back.

1664
01:38:03,707 --> 01:38:05,607
Here we go.

1665
01:38:05,709 --> 01:38:08,269
Now, number one.

1666
01:38:08,378 --> 01:38:10,812
Okay.

1667
01:38:10,914 --> 01:38:13,940
- Now, type it out.
- Um, what is...

1668
01:38:14,050 --> 01:38:19,682
the total weight of the Earth?

1669
01:38:19,789 --> 01:38:23,657
Now, the totaling key.

1670
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:26,695
Bope-bope-pe-do to you!

1671
01:38:29,532 --> 01:38:31,659
What's the matter?

1672
01:38:31,768 --> 01:38:35,204
- It's asking you a question.
- What's the question?

1673
01:38:35,305 --> 01:38:39,241
"With or without people?"

1674
01:38:39,342 --> 01:38:41,503
Good girl.
Good girl.

1675
01:38:41,611 --> 01:38:46,241
May I tell you that that is the nicest
compliment EMMARAC has ever received?

1676
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:49,648
You may.

1677
01:38:49,753 --> 01:38:52,051
I better go down to Payroll
and see how they're doing.

1678
01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:54,123
You wouldn't have another hairpin,
would you, I could use?

1679
01:38:54,224 --> 01:38:57,785
- Oh! Yes, indeed. There you are.
- Thank you.

1680
01:39:12,342 --> 01:39:15,038
- Hi, Smithers. How are you?
- Huh? Oh! Oh!

1681
01:39:15,145 --> 01:39:17,807
I'm all right now,
but it's sure been a nervous morning.

1682
01:39:17,914 --> 01:39:20,382
- Aspirin?
- No, thanks.

1683
01:39:21,417 --> 01:39:23,351
Hello, Sumner.

1684
01:39:56,786 --> 01:39:58,549
Oh!

1685
01:39:58,655 --> 01:40:00,589
Smithers, come with us.
Sumner is buying!

1686
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:02,817
I don't want a drink
in the middle of the day.

1687
01:40:02,926 --> 01:40:04,894
You can have a malted.

1688
01:40:28,585 --> 01:40:31,679
- Miss Watson.
- What do you want?

1689
01:40:31,788 --> 01:40:33,756
Could you come out and give me
a hand with EMMARAC, please?

1690
01:40:33,857 --> 01:40:36,553
- Sumner, does it have to be now?
- Now or never.

1691
01:40:36,659 --> 01:40:40,288
Uh, well... well, now look, Mike,
I won't be a minute.

1692
01:40:40,396 --> 01:40:41,556
Excuse us, old man.

1693
01:40:41,664 --> 01:40:44,132
If Emmy's going to be
this much trouble...

1694
01:40:44,234 --> 01:40:48,193
Actually, it's my fault. It's on account
of this question I asked her.

1695
01:40:48,304 --> 01:40:52,764
Now, if you should say to me,
"What question?" I would, uh, tell you.

1696
01:40:52,876 --> 01:40:56,744
- What question?
- We'll, uh... We'll try it again.

1697
01:40:56,846 --> 01:41:02,045
Should Bunny Watson...

1698
01:41:02,151 --> 01:41:06,053
marry Mike Cutler,

1699
01:41:06,155 --> 01:41:09,147
question mark.

1700
01:41:09,259 --> 01:41:12,160
Wait a minute. I thought you said
this machine can't evaluate.

1701
01:41:12,262 --> 01:41:14,162
It can't. It can't.

1702
01:41:14,264 --> 01:41:16,255
It can only repeat the information...

1703
01:41:16,366 --> 01:41:19,961
that has been fed into it
by the human element.

1704
01:41:20,069 --> 01:41:22,037
What does it say?

1705
01:41:24,073 --> 01:41:27,668
You know perfectly well
what it says.

1706
01:41:27,777 --> 01:41:31,577
Uh, yeah. That's the same answer
I got the last time.

1707
01:41:31,681 --> 01:41:34,650
Uh, shall we ask it
another question? Good.

1708
01:41:36,819 --> 01:41:39,549
Should Bunny Watson...

1709
01:41:39,656 --> 01:41:44,616
marry Richard Sumner,
question mark.

1710
01:41:49,365 --> 01:41:52,493
- "N-O."
- No?

1711
01:41:53,670 --> 01:41:57,197
See for yourself.

1712
01:41:57,307 --> 01:42:00,572
- No.
- What...

1713
01:42:00,677 --> 01:42:05,410
Huh! Well, I told you myself
that EMMARAC could make a mistake.

1714
01:42:05,515 --> 01:42:08,678
- But not Bunny Watson. It'd never work.
- Why?

1715
01:42:08,785 --> 01:42:10,685
Because you're not in love with me.
You're in love with her.

1716
01:42:10,787 --> 01:42:12,186
She'd always come first.

1717
01:42:12,288 --> 01:42:15,086
If anything went wrong with her,
you'd forget about me like that.

1718
01:42:15,191 --> 01:42:18,183
I couldn't care less about that...

1719
01:42:18,294 --> 01:42:21,855
It could blow up right now,
and it wouldn't bother me.

1720
01:42:21,965 --> 01:42:24,399
Is that so? Let's see.

1721
01:42:30,673 --> 01:42:33,369
See? It doesn't mean
a thing to me.

1722
01:42:33,476 --> 01:42:36,104
You're the only thing I care about.

1723
01:42:37,513 --> 01:42:40,482
Honestly, it'll...
it'll only take a second.

1724
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:45,043
I'll wait.
