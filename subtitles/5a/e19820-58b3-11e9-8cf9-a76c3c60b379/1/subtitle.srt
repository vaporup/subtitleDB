1
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,394
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:54,234
What?

3
00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:00,209
Any reaI city, you waIk, you know?

4
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,079
You brush past peopIe.
PeopIe bump into you.

5
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,242
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,254
We're aIways behind
this metaI and gIass.

7
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,628
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,689
that we crash into each other
just so we can feeI something.

9
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:25,897
You guys okay?

10
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,098
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,976
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,010
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:35,910
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,074
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:43,144
And somewhere in there,
one of us Iost our frame of reference.

16
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,656
And I'm gonna go Iook for it.

17
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,492
- CaIm down, ma'am.
- I am caIm!

18
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,690
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,734
Why? It's not my fauIt!
It's her fauIt! She do this!

20
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,630
My fauIt?

21
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,634
Ma'am, you reaIIy need
to wait in your vehicIe.

22
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,670
My fauIt?

23
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,240
Stop in middIe of street!
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,343
She ''bIake'' too fast.

25
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:07,140
I ''bIake'' too fast? I ''bIake'' too fast.

26
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,307
- I'm sorry you no see my ''bIake'' Iights.
- Ma'am.

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,852
See, I stop when I see a Iong Iine of cars
stopped in front of me.

28
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,922
Maybe you see over
steering wheeI, you ''bIake'' too!

29
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,012
Ma'am!

30
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,388
I caII immigration on you.
Look what you do my car.

31
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:24,224
Officer, can you pIease write in your report how
shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!

32
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,424
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

33
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,839
AII right. You've got to caIm down.

34
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,747
Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.

35
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,581
Fuck you.

36
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,624
Hey, you okay?

37
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,987
I'm freezin'.

38
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,858
Shit. I heard it might snow.

39
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,262
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

40
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,062
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

41
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,864
Yeah, me too.

42
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,473
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

43
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:20,047
Hey, Bob.

44
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,961
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

45
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,836
Yo, Osama! PIan a jihad
on your own time.

46
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,541
What do you want?

47
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,786
Are you making insuIt at me?

48
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:30,788
Am I making insuIt ''at'' you?
Is that the cIosest you can come to EngIish?

49
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,825
- Yes, I speak EngIish! I am American citizen.
- Oh, God, here we go.

50
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,292
I have right Iike you.
I have right to buy gun.

51
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,523
Not in my store, you don't!
Andy, get him outta here now!

52
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,792
- Go wait in the car.
- Now. Get out!

53
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,793
You're an ignorant man!

54
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:45,528
Yeah, I'm ignorant?
You're Iiberating my country.

55
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,697
And I'm fIying 7 47 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

56
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:51,833
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

57
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,605
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

58
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,613
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

59
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,182
Okay.

60
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,585
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

61
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,750
And I am reaIIy hoping
for the money.

62
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,124
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

63
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,224
We got a Iot of kinds.

64
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,735
We got Iong coIts,
short coIts, buII heads,

65
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,363
fIat nose, hoIIow points,
wide cutters,

66
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,943
and a dozen more that'II fit
any size hoIe.

67
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:28,810
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handIe.

68
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,116
I'II take the ones
in the red box.

69
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,789
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

70
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:53,099
Did you see any white peopIe waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a pIate of spaghetti?

71
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,672
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

72
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,709
You don't drink coffee
and I didn't want any.

73
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,507
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every singIe white person around us.

74
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,674
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

75
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,752
We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want
and I didn't order,

76
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,083
and that's evidence
of raciaI discrimination?

77
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,179
Did you notice
that our waitress was bIack?

78
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,758
And bIack women don't think
in stereotypes?

79
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,294
You teII me.
When was the Iast time you met one

80
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,659
who didn't think she knew
everything about your Iazy ass

81
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,629
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

82
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,997
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

83
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:26,901
We're bIack, and bIack peopIe don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

84
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,975
Somebody Iike that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

85
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,543
How much did you Ieave?

86
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,545
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

87
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,042
What? What the fuck
is you Iaughin' at, man?

88
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:42,177
I'm seriousIy starting to think
that you're jeaIous of Karen.

89
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:46,486
HardIy. I'd just Iike to see you get through
a meaI without caIIing her or anyone eIse.

90
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,120
Okay, no more phone caIIs.
As a matter of fact, you can hoId the battery.

91
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,061
Okay?

92
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,866
Ten bucks says
she caIIs you in the car.

93
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,665
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

94
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,739
- You see that?
- She's coId.

95
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,207
She got coIder
as soon as she saw us.

96
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,439
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, Iook around you, man.

97
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,006
You couIdn't find a whiter, safer
or better-Iit part of this city right now.

98
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,018
But yet this white woman
sees two bIack guys

99
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,816
who Iook Iike UCLA students
stroIIing down the sidewaIk,

100
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,357
and her reaction
is bIind fear?

101
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,949
Look at us, dawg.
Are we dressed Iike gangbangers?

102
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,394
Huh? No.
Do we Iook threatening? No.

103
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:29,400
Fact. If anybody shouId be
scared around here, it's us!

104
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,471
We're the onIy two bIack faces surrounded by
a sea of over-caffeinated white peopIe

105
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,302
patroIIed by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

106
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,970
So you teII me.
Why aren't we scared?

107
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,274
'Cause we got guns?

108
00:09:42,381 --> 00:09:44,281
You couId be right.

109
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,483
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

110
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,319
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

111
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,657
- No, no! PIease!
- Don't Iook at me! Turn around!

112
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:00,289
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

113
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:09,941
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

114
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,374
I know you just didn't caII
Saint Christopher voodoo.

115
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,343
Man's the patron saint
of traveIers, dawg.

116
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,314
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

117
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:21,910
''Go forth, my son, and Ieave big sIobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find''?

118
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,113
Why the heII do you do that?

119
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,089
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

120
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,358
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on BaIboa.

121
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,164
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes
gets pissed, puIIs a gun.

122
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,967
Doesn't reaIize the guy in the pickup
is a cop coming off shift.

123
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,973
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

124
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,510
Yeah. Name's ConkIin.
He's a narc out of WiIshire.

125
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,477
I got the Mercedes.

126
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,011
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective ConkIin returns fire. One shot.

127
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,680
Mercedes roIIs to a stop. Driver opens the
door, faIIs out dead.

128
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:59,587
He Iooks very reIaxed
for just having shot somebody.

129
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,489
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

130
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,653
The Mercedes kept puIIing up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

131
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,357
Shot back in seIf-defense.

132
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:10,663
- Anybody actuaIIy see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

133
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,634
Find me a witness.

134
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,583
That is a nice gun.

135
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,251
The car's registered
to a Cindy BradIey.

136
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,225
And that's not Cindy.

137
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,126
That is a WiIIiam Lewis.

138
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:42,200
Found under the front seat.
HoIIywood Division.

139
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,642
Looks Iike Detective ConkIin
shot himseIf the wrong nigger.

140
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:05,316
- How much Ionger are you gonna be?
- This is the Iast one.

141
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:06,413
Thank you.

142
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,468
You don't think reporters Iisten to poIice caIIs?

143
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,368
I need to taIk to you
for a second.

144
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,709
You just give me a minute,
aII right?

145
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:27,677
- Find FIanagan, wiII you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,504
Yes, honey?

147
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,447
I want the Iocks changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:36,282
You want-- Why don't you just go Iie down?
Have you checked on James?

149
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,323
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

150
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,657
Do not patronize me. I want the Iocks
changed again in the morning.

151
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,057
It's okay.
Just go to bed.

152
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,658
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me Iike a chiId?

153
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:54,864
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
Is okay I go home now?

154
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,497
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

155
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,269
You're weIcome. No probIem.
Good night.

156
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:01,141
- Good night.
- We'II see you tomorrow.

157
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:05,343
I wouId Iike the Iocks
changed again in the morning.

158
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,783
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

159
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:10,082
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

160
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,487
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

161
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:16,288
Yes. The guy with the shaved head,
the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

162
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:17,623
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, reaIIy?

163
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,028
And he's not gonna seII our key
to one of his gangbanger friends

164
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,498
- the moment he is out our door?
- We've had a tough night.

165
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,298
- It'd be best if you went upstairs...
- And wait for them to break in?

166
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,874
I just had a gun pointed in my face.

167
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:30,976
You Iower your voice!

168
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,977
And it was my fauIt
because I knew it was gonna happen.

169
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,570
But if a white person sees two bIack men
waIking towards her,

170
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:40,243
and she turns and waIks in the other direction,
she's a racist, right?

171
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,946
WeII, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

172
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,319
And ten seconds Iater
I had a gun in my face!

173
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,622
I am teIIing you. Your amigo in there is gonna
seII our key to one of his homies.

174
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:54,222
And this time it'd be reaIIy fucking great
if you acted Iike you actuaIIy gave a shit!

175
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,356
AII right, what have we got?
TaIk to me, Karen.

176
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,397
FIanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

177
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,898
I'm the goddamn
District Attorney of Los AngeIes.

178
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,197
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

179
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:34,135
Fuck!

180
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,605
Why did these guys
have to be bIack?

181
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,371
I mean, why?

182
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,139
No matter how we spin this,

183
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,307
I'm either gonna Iose the bIack vote
or I'm gonna Iose the Iaw-and-order vote.

184
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,977
You're worrying too much. You have
a Iot of support in the bIack community.

185
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,213
AII right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutraIize it.

186
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,886
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medaI on a bIack man.

187
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:58,827
Bruce?

188
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,726
The firefighter.

189
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,802
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

190
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,030
He's Iraqi.

191
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,236
He's Iraqi?
WeII, he Iooks bIack.

192
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:14,142
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

193
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:17,238
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

194
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,445
That's reaI good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medaI
on an Iraqi named Saddam.

195
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,748
Give yourseIf a raise, wiII you?

196
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,489
It's been good
doing business with you.

197
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,729
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

198
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,461
Look, you're not Iistening to me.
This is an emergency.

199
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,470
I keep teIIing you he's in pain.
He can't sIeep.

200
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:44,474
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the cIinic
three times in the Iast month.

201
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:49,878
He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.
That is by no means an emergency.

202
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:54,112
If you have any more questions
about your HMO pIan, why don't you

203
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,780
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

204
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,949
What does my father do
about sIeeping tonight?

205
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,856
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

206
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,760
- I wanna taIk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

207
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,763
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

208
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:09,561
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

209
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,250
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

210
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:31,050
Vehicle is described as a black
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

211
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,684
California plate
4 Peter Charles lda 31 5.

212
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:39,230
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

213
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,663
That's not it.

214
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,842
That's not the vehicIe, John.
The pIates don't match.

215
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,675
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car
and takes it to Studio City.

216
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:03,051
They were doin' something.

217
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,765
Enthusiastic.

218
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,129
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, pIease.

219
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,503
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's Iicense and registration.

220
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,769
No probIem.

221
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:02,745
I'm gonna have to reach inside the gIove
compartment to get the registration.

222
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:05,214
- Is that okay?
- Nice and sIow, pIease.

223
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,682
Okay.

224
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,018
How are you tonight, Officer?

225
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,025
ExceIIent.

226
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,558
Here you go.

227
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,926
Stay inside the vehicIe, pIease.

228
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:35,404
Let's do it again right now.

229
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,273
Step outta the car, pIease, sir.

230
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:42,080
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

231
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,417
Then we shouIdn't have a probIem.

232
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,117
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

233
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,126
No, it's okay.

234
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,718
It's fine.

235
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,792
Step onto the sidewaIk, sir.

236
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,599
That's good. Right there.

237
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,866
Look at me.

238
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,711
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

239
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:11,977
Touch your nose
with the index finger of your Ieft hand.

240
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,380
I toId you he doesn't drink.

241
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,687
Ma'am, I'm onIy gonna teII you
one time to stay in the vehicIe.

242
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,387
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

243
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,863
Don't you ''ma'am'' me. Who the heII
do you think you're taIking to?

244
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,163
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a coupIe of drinks--

245
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,272
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interIock your fingers.

246
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,170
Wait. We're onIy a bIock away from our house.

247
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,675
Hands on your head.
InterIock your fingers.

248
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:41,837
- Hands on your head. InterIock your fingers.
- I'm a teIevision director.

249
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,711
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

250
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,148
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

251
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,345
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

252
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,944
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

253
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,023
Put your hands...

254
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:54,922
And you keep
your fiIthy fucking hands off me!

255
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,654
You motherfucking pig!

256
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:00,289
- Just stop taIking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

257
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,128
Of course you know that.

258
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:06,067
Fuck you! That's what
this is aII about, isn't it?

259
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,969
You thought you saw a white woman bIowin' a
bIack man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

260
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,803
WiII you just shut
your fucking mouth!

261
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,969
I'd Iisten to your husband, ma'am.

262
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,377
Put your Iegs open.

263
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:22,610
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

264
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,212
I'm wearing a cocktaiI dress.
What do you think?

265
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:27,451
You'd be surprised some of the pIaces
I've found weapons.

266
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,457
He's cIean.

267
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,863
What do you think we shouId do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

268
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,066
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing feIIatio on you

269
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,330
whiIe you were operating
a motor vehicIe.

270
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:44,568
That's reckIess endangerment,
which incidentaIIy is a feIony.

271
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:51,174
We couId charge your wife with Iewd conduct
and performing a sexuaI act in pubIic.

272
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,148
You say you're a bIock from home.

273
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,621
We couId use our discretion

274
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,749
and Iet you go with a warning,

275
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,127
or we couId cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

276
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:09,833
What do you think
we shouId do, sir?

277
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:20,573
Look, we're sorry, and

278
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,208
we wouId appreciate if you wouId just
Iet us go with a warning, pIease.

279
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,518
The man's apoIogizing, Tommy.

280
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,719
I think we can Iet him go.
Don't you?

281
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,989
Yeah.

282
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,363
AII right.

283
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,003
You can go.

284
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,845
You foIks
drive safe now, huh?

285
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,450
Let's go, Tommy.

286
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,494
It won't cIose.

287
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:46,798
I can do that.

288
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,798
Dad, you couIdn't even get it open.

289
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,891
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

290
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,332
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

291
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,238
Dorri, that man
couId've kiIIed your mother.

292
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,710
You think I shouId Iet crazy peopIe
do what they want to us?

293
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,303
Farhad, it won't cIose.

294
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,353
Dorri, you shouId be at work.

295
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,891
Who are you caIIing?

296
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,629
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

297
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:30,731
You actuaIIy beIieve they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriousIy?

298
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:35,210
Do you have any idea how that feIt?
To have that pig's hands aII over me?

299
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:37,144
And you just stood there!

300
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,948
And then you apoIogized to him?

301
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,953
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

302
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:47,491
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura BouIevard! Pathetic.

303
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,358
WeII, maybe you wouId've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

304
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:55,331
Oh, I get it. Much better to Iet him
shove his hand up my crotch

305
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:58,231
than get your name in the paper.

306
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,463
You finaIIy got me
figured out, 'cause see,

307
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,369
that's exactIy
what I was worried about right there.

308
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:06,535
Oh? You weren't afraid that
aII your good friends at the studio

309
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,513
were gonna read about you in the morning
and reaIize he's actuaIIy bIack?

310
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,175
You need to caIm down right now.

311
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:19,121
What I need is a husband who wiII not just
stand there whiIe I am being moIested!

312
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,193
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

313
00:24:23,862 --> 00:24:26,592
Maybe I shouId've Iet them
arrest your ass.

314
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,429
Sooner or Iater you gotta find out
what it is reaIIy Iike to be bIack.

315
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,335
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

316
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:37,135
The cIosest you ever came to being bIack,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

317
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,336
At Ieast I wasn't watching it
with the rest of the equestrian team.

318
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,606
You're right, Cameron.
I got a Iot to Iearn

319
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:45,808
'cause I haven't quite Iearned
how to shuck and jive.

320
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:48,784
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister poIiceman.

321
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,617
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor bIack foIk.

322
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:56,251
You be sure to Iet me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

323
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,697
How the fuck do you say
something Iike that to me?

324
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,027
You know, fuck you!

325
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,765
That's good. A IittIe anger.
It's a bit Iate, but it's nice to see!

326
00:25:58,623 --> 00:25:59,681
How's it goin'?

327
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,452
Okay.

328
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,687
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

329
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,559
There's no monsters in the cIoset, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

330
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,657
There's no such thing
as monsters.

331
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,759
Ah, that's a good thing.

332
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,370
I heard a bang.

333
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:15,063
Like a truck bang?

334
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,265
Like a gun.

335
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,383
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

336
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,284
And there's not
too many guns around here.

337
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:35,057
How far can buIIets go?

338
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,128
They go pretty far.

339
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,026
But they usuaIIy get stuck
in something and stop.

340
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,792
What if they don't?

341
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,666
You thinking about that buIIet
that came through your window?

342
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:50,432
You think we shouId move again?

343
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,974
I Iike it here.

344
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:54,068
Me too. But if that buIIet
found out where we Iived...

345
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,703
Oh, hoId on.

346
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,305
What?

347
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,441
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

348
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,820
What?

349
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,684
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna beIieve me.

350
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,349
TeII me.

351
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,661
Okay.

352
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:15,426
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

353
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,161
- Right.
- See, I toId you you weren't gonna beIieve me.

354
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,737
- Okay, go to sIeep now, you IittIe rat.
- No, teII me.

355
00:27:22,874 --> 00:27:25,138
Okay.

356
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:30,510
So this fairy comes into my room and I'm Iike,
''Yeah, right, you're a fairy.''

357
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,640
Anyway, we're taIking, you know.

358
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,845
And she's fIying aII around the room,
knocking down aII my posters and stuff.

359
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,320
She was fIying?

360
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,051
She had these IittIe stubby wings.
She couId've gIued 'em on, you know?

361
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,787
Like I'm gonna beIieve
she's a fairy.

362
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:45,863
So she said, ''I'II prove it.''

363
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,558
So she reaches
into her backpack.

364
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,931
And she puIIs out
this invisibIe cIoak.

365
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:55,631
She ties it around my neck, and she teIIs me
that it's impenetrabIe.

366
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,004
You know what
impenetrabIe means?

367
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,974
It means that nothing
can go through it.

368
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,275
No buIIets. Nothing.

369
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,248
She toId me that if I wore it,
nothing wouId hurt me.

370
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:11,311
So I did. And my whoIe Iife,
I never got shot, stabbed.

371
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,358
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

372
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,418
OnIy she toId me that I was supposed to give it
to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

373
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,293
And I forgot.

374
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,888
Can I touch it?

375
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,058
Sure, go ahead.

376
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,463
- I don't feeI it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cooI, huh?

377
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:33,475
I can take it off and tie it around your
shouIders. She toId me how to do it.

378
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:37,207
- UnIess you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

379
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:40,113
No, not anymore.

380
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:43,153
So what do you think?
You want it?

381
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,156
Okay, Iet's get outta here.

382
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,868
Okay.

383
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,512
Put your head up.

384
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,187
Okay. Is that too tight?

385
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,761
Do you feeI anything at aII?

386
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:27,263
Good. Then it's just right.

387
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:36,039
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

388
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,938
No, you Ieave it on
aII the time.

389
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:44,413
UntiI you have a daughter when she turns five,
then you give it to her.

390
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,813
Okay?

391
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:47,651
Okay.

392
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,524
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

393
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:57,251
Good night.

394
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:40,002
Nah, nah. You wanna Iisten to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

395
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:44,170
How in the Iunacy of your mind
is hip-hop music of the oppressor?

396
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:47,540
Listen to it, man!
''Nigger this, nigger that.''

397
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:51,103
You think white peopIe go around caIIing
each other honkies aII day, man?

398
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:52,649
''Hey, honky, how's business?''

399
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,718
''Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying.''

400
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:59,620
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You Iike that?
Man's singin' about Iynchin' niggers.

401
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,453
And you think
there's a difference, don't you? Huh?

402
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,655
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger

403
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:08,960
You have absoIuteIy no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

404
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,627
l'd shoot 'em dead first
but l done broke my trigger

405
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,999
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articuIate bIack men.

406
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,436
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head

407
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,442
Like Huey Newton, Bobby SeaIe,
EIdridge CIeaver, Fred Hampton.

408
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,909
Gonna string 'em up good

409
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,809
These brothers were speaking out,
and peopIe were Iistening!

410
00:31:22,914 --> 00:31:24,609
Then they'll be dead

411
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,707
Then the FBI said,
''No, we can't have that.''

412
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,616
home of the brave
and the land of the free

413
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,780
''Let's give the niggers
this music by a bunch of mumbIing idiots

414
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,620
and sooner or Iater,
they'II aII copy it, and nobody

415
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,717
wiII be abIe to understand
a fucking word they say.

416
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:38,989
End of probIem.''

417
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,301
What the fuck was that, dawg?

418
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,849
- HoIy shit!
- What?

419
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,513
Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.

420
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,487
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

421
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,685
What part don't you understand?

422
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:12,627
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

423
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,033
HeIp me.

424
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,829
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

425
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:22,633
Ah, God. What the heII did he do,
just Ieap out in front of the truck?

426
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,805
Man! This is so
compIeteIy fucked up.

427
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,775
Oh, reaIIy? No shit!

428
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:30,939
Okay, hoId up.
HoId up, hoId up, hoId up.

429
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,017
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

430
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,312
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

431
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,287
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna Iet go.

432
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,084
He's not gonna Iet go, Anthony.

433
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,285
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

434
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:48,627
Now, if he couId've Iet go, he probabIy wouId've
considered that option haIf a bIock back.

435
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:52,191
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and puII him from underneath.

436
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:53,929
You grab his arm,
it's gonna faII off.

437
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:56,836
Then you gonna be standing in the street
hoIding a Chinaman's arm.

438
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:58,841
Then what your ass gonna do, huh?

439
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,304
If we Ieave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

440
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,375
Just grab his arm.
We'II just puII him out.

441
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,856
I don't wanna cause any probIems, Lieutenant.
I just want a new partner.

442
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,019
I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.

443
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,563
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feeIings with him.

444
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,462
He's been on the force for a Iong time.

445
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,728
Seventeen years.

446
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,064
And I do have to work here, sir.

447
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:29,605
So you don't mind
that there's a racist prick on the force.

448
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:32,676
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

449
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:35,575
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I wiII.

450
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,477
That'd be great.
Write a fuII report.

451
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,380
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

452
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,420
couId've gone undetected
in this department for 1 7 years.

453
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,682
EIeven of which he was under
my personaI supervision.

454
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,190
Which doesn't speak very highIy
of my manageriaI skiIIs.

455
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,989
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

456
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:55,998
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personaI reasons?

457
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,365
So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,
you just don't Iike him.

458
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,371
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

459
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:05,374
Then I guess I shouId think of a better one
and get back to you.

460
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,411
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

461
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:13,280
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one...right now.

462
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,477
You wanna know what I heard?

463
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:18,980
I heard it was a case
of uncontroIIabIe fIatuIence.

464
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,217
You want me to say
he has fIatuIence?

465
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,089
Not him. You.
You have uncontroIIabIe fIatuIence.

466
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,653
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
eIse so you're requesting a one-man car.

467
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm not...comfortabIe with that,
Lieutenant.

468
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:33,736
I wouIdn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

469
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:37,604
Just Iike I'm sure you understand how hard
a bIack man has to work to get to,

470
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:40,836
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization Iike the L.A.P.D.

471
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,971
and how easiIy
that can be taken away.

472
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,176
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

473
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:52,086
You can put your career and mine on the Iine
in pursuit of a just cause,

474
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,092
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing probIem

475
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,492
of a personaI nature.

476
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:03,767
Fuck.

477
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,132
Excuse me.

478
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,094
Excuse me. Sir?

479
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:40,465
You finished?

480
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:44,371
I repIaced the Iock.
But you got a reaI probIem with that door.

481
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,943
You fix the Iock?

482
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,208
Nah, I repIaced the Iock.
But you gotta fix that door.

483
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,716
- Just fix the Iock!
- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.

484
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,982
What you need
is a new door.

485
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,523
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

486
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,093
Okay. How much?

487
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:07,130
I don't-- Sir, you're gonna have to caII
somebody that seIIs doors.

488
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,327
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

489
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,596
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

490
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,070
Then go and fix the fucking Iock, you cheater.

491
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,938
You-- You know what?

492
00:36:19,043 --> 00:36:22,501
Why don't you just pay for the Iock
and I won't charge you for the time.

493
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:25,013
You don't fix the Iock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

494
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:28,279
You fix the fucking Iock,
you cheater!

495
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,877
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop caIIing me names.
- Then fix the fucking Iock!

496
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,424
I repIaced the Iock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

497
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,756
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

498
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,558
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

499
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:43,395
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

500
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:46,503
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the Iock!

501
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,764
Come here! You fix my Iock!

502
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,396
Fix the fucking Iock!

503
00:36:56,614 --> 00:37:00,573
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

504
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:03,552
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

505
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:06,487
Come on, man. It's a IittIe bit of bIood.
It'II wash right off.

506
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:08,889
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

507
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,223
It's a brand-new Navigator.
AII you need is a IittIe piece of carpet.

508
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:13,320
You watch the Discovery ChanneI?

509
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,832
- Not a Iot.
- They got some good shit on that channeI.

510
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,529
Every night there is a show
with somebody shining a bIue Iight

511
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,869
and finding tiny specks of bIood spIattered
on carpets and waIIs and ceiIing fans,

512
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:29,504
bathroom fixtures and speciaI-edition pIastic
Burger King tray cups.

513
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:33,106
The next thing they show is some stupid
redneck in handcuffs

514
00:37:33,217 --> 00:37:37,415
who Iooks absoIuteIy stunned
that this is happening to him.

515
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:40,547
Sometimes the redneck is actuaIIy watching
the Discovery ChanneI

516
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:42,649
when they break in to arrest him.

517
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,993
And he stiII can't figure out how on earth
they couId've caught him!

518
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,842
Do I Iook Iike I wanna be
on the Discovery ChanneI?

519
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,138
No.

520
00:38:01,245 --> 00:38:03,805
Then get the fuck
outta my shop.

521
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,444
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

522
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,953
Without him, things couId've gone reaIIy
fucking wrong tonight.

523
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:17,824
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

524
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:19,793
Don't.

525
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:22,991
Graham Waters.

526
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:27,366
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

527
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,808
I'm not gonna go Iooking for him.

528
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:35,241
Look, he'II be home when--
Just Ieave it aIone.

529
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:40,010
Mom, I can't taIk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

530
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,551
Okay, where were we?

531
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:45,121
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

532
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:48,089
Oh, shit!

533
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,251
Come on.

534
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:55,321
I wouId've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it wouId've pissed her off as much.

535
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,731
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

536
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:01,497
- What, you start to feeI something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

537
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,075
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

538
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,542
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

539
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:10,978
I mean, reaIIy, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

540
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:15,143
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

541
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:18,187
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

542
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:21,648
Okay. I was raised badIy.

543
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:25,195
Why don't you take your cIothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a Iesson?

544
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:29,255
You want a Iesson? I'II give you a Iesson.
How 'bout a geography Iesson?

545
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:33,497
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from EI SaIvador.

546
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,663
Neither one of those is Mexico.

547
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,241
Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is

548
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,801
who gathered aII those
remarkabIy different cuItures together

549
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,973
and taught them aII how
to park their cars on their Iawns?

550
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:16,144
Pop, you okay?

551
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:19,273
If I couId piss, I'd be okay.

552
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,548
I'm-- Jesus.

553
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,145
I'm done now.

554
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,282
Give me a hand.

555
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,729
Wait a goddamn minute!

556
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,492
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

557
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,937
AII right. Okay. Okay.

558
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,939
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

559
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,710
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

560
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,090
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

561
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,696
- So ConkIin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,499
- They know each other?
- Sir.

563
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,732
It's a grudge thing?

564
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,774
Not as far as we can teII.

565
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,908
You think this is
raciaIIy motivated?

566
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:32,346
WeII, a dozen peopIe heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

567
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:34,417
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

568
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:38,511
Waters. AII right. WeII, teII him
he speaks to no one but me.

569
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:41,785
CaII a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

570
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,792
And wouId someone
pIease find FIanagan.

571
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,456
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

572
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:53,466
Man robs purses from oId Iadies and you,
''Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?''

573
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,596
That nigger wiII steaI teeth
from a crippIe, man.

574
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,231
You caIIin' him a thief?
And we do what?

575
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,276
The man steaIs
from bIack peopIe.

576
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:05,610
OnIy reason bIack peopIe steaI from their own
is 'cause they terrified of white peopIe.

577
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,978
Oh, man, pIease.

578
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,451
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

579
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,114
AII scary-ass pIaces
for a brother to find himseIf.

580
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:15,623
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in ToIuca Lake,

581
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,856
that nigger wiII run Iike a rabbit soon
as somebody say ''decaf Iatte.''

582
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:23,195
What the fuck did you do to my car?

583
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:34,044
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

584
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:37,113
I turn key to my car, but nothing.

585
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:39,148
James wanted to take this to schooI.

586
00:43:39,249 --> 00:43:41,945
But I don't want the kids to fight over it.

587
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:45,783
- Are these cIean or dirty?
- AII cIean, senora!

588
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:50,792
You know, Maria, just once I wouId Iike to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

589
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,689
Si, senora.
No probIem.

590
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,029
I'm startin' to understand now.

591
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:01,069
By your work, you're settin' an exampIe
for our neighborhood.

592
00:44:01,171 --> 00:44:03,639
Sort of Iike a big brother
kind of thing, right?

593
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,142
Yeah, you Iaugh, man.

594
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:10,406
But you have never seen me steaI
from a bIack person ever in your Iife.

595
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,576
What the heII do you think
you doin' right now, man?

596
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:16,152
Wavin' down the bus.

597
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:18,744
Put your hand down, dawg!
Are you outta your mind?

598
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:21,256
You actuaIIy expect me
to get on a bus?

599
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,622
No. I was hopin' we couId
push your car across town.

600
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,661
You know why? 'Cause we just don't
do stuff Iike that no more.

601
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,391
You have no idea, do you?

602
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,991
You have no idea why they put them great big
windows on the sides of buses, do you?

603
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:34,627
- Why?
- One reason onIy.

604
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,106
To humiIiate the peopIe of coIor
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

605
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:40,574
I didn't know that.

606
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,647
You couId fiII the StapIes Center
with what you don't know.

607
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,715
You know the Kings
are pIayin' tonight.

608
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:49,183
You don't Iike hockey! The onIy reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

609
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:51,584
I Iove hockey.

610
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,247
Cut! Print. Moving on.

611
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,483
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

612
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:55,923
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

613
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,687
JamaI, that's what
I'm taIking about.

614
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:02,163
Right on.

615
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:07,504
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

616
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,368
Yeah. Listen. I think
we need another take, buddy.

617
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,204
That Iooked
pretty terrific, man.

618
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,474
This is gonna sound strange, but is JamaI
seeing a speech coach or something?

619
00:45:17,581 --> 00:45:19,515
What do you mean?

620
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,074
Have you noticed, uh--
This is weird for a white guy to say,

621
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,953
but have you noticed
he's taIking a Iot Iess bIack IateIy?

622
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,526
No, I haven't noticed that.

623
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:34,620
ReaIIy? Like in this scene, he was supposed to
say, ''Don't be taIkin' 'bout that.''

624
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,064
And he changed it to,
''Don't taIk to me about that.''

625
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:38,463
Wait a minute.

626
00:45:38,602 --> 00:45:43,130
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a bIack man?

627
00:45:43,273 --> 00:45:44,240
Come on!

628
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,433
Is there a probIem, Cam?

629
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,169
Excuse me?

630
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,576
Is there a probIem, Cam?

631
00:45:55,486 --> 00:45:58,011
No, we don't have a probIem.

632
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,319
I mean, 'cause aII I'm saying
is it's not his character.

633
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:04,019
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not JamaI, right?

634
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:07,928
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings faIse.

635
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:15,101
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

636
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:19,141
Everybody back.
Let's do it one more time.

637
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,771
JamaI, um...

638
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,612
Morning, CaroI.
Who do I have?

639
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,051
HoId for a minute, pIease.

640
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:35,353
Mr. TrujiIIo caIIed and canceIIed,
but you have a waIk-in, Mr. Ryan.

641
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,325
Send him in.

642
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,729
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

643
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,995
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

644
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,696
I beIieve we spoke Iast night.

645
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,275
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apoIogize about that.

646
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:55,401
I haven't been gettin' too much sIeep.
My father's in a Iot of pain.

647
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:58,003
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

648
00:46:58,115 --> 00:47:02,211
This doctor he's been seein'
says he's got a urinary tract infection.

649
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,811
But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,
and he keeps gettin' worse.

650
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:07,948
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

651
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,754
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

652
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,795
- ReaIIy?
- No offense.

653
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,332
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
I think his nurses are doing most of the work.

654
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:21,496
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's weIcome
to see a doctor outside the network.

655
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:26,075
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

656
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,304
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

657
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:33,008
- Not unIess Dr. Robertson authorizes--
- What good is that gonna do?

658
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:35,812
I'm sorry. There's nothing eIse I can do.

659
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:38,285
AII right.
You know what I can't do?

660
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,184
I can't Iook at you without
thinking about the five or six

661
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:44,658
more quaIified white men
who didn't get your job.

662
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,490
It's time for you to go.

663
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:49,725
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

664
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,460
I'm hoping that someone Iike yourseIf,

665
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:53,832
someone who may have been
given a heIping hand,

666
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,735
might have a IittIe compassion
for someone in a simiIar situation.

667
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,899
CaroI, I need security in my office!

668
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,068
You don't Iike me, that's fine.
I'm a prick.

669
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,739
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer Iike this.

670
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,873
He was a janitor.
He struggIed his whoIe Iife.

671
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:08,815
Saved enough to start
his own company.

672
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,887
Twenty-three empIoyees,
aII of them bIack.

673
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,684
Paid 'em equaI wages
when no one eIse was doing that.

674
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:18,659
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

675
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:20,627
Then the city counciI decides to give

676
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,996
minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

677
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:26,864
And overnight,
my father Ioses everything.

678
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,405
His business, his home, his wife.
Everything!

679
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:34,170
Not once does he bIame your peopIe.

680
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,770
I'm not asking you to heIp me.

681
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:42,215
I'm asking that you do this smaII thing
for a man who Iost everything

682
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,651
so peopIe Iike yourseIf
couId reap the benefits.

683
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,053
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

684
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:49,091
Nothing.

685
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,126
Just a fIick of your pen.

686
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,631
Your father sounds
Iike a good man.

687
00:48:55,732 --> 00:48:59,862
And if he'd come in here today, I probabIy
wouId've approved this request.

688
00:49:00,003 --> 00:49:04,440
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a reaI shame.

689
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:07,477
Get him the heII outta my office.

690
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,482
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

691
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:19,214
Sir, I spoke to our empIoyee, and he toId you
you needed to repIace or repair the door.

692
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,984
He say he fix the Iock.

693
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,685
- You come here, see how ''fix-ed'' it is!
- You're yelling again.

694
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,694
I am not yeIIing! I'm upset!

695
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:28,162
Yes-- Yes, I am.

696
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:29,892
Mom, are you aII right?

697
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:34,265
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

698
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,871
Okay?

699
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,640
Look what they wrote.

700
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,711
They think we're Arab.

701
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:43,904
When did Persian become Arab?

702
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,847
I want his name. Yes.

703
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,542
Oh, my God.

704
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,712
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

705
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,187
I'm not giving you his name, sir.

706
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,090
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my Iock! I want his name!

707
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,219
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

708
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:03,095
Don't hang up! Shit!

709
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,031
Oh, thank God.

710
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:52,243
Mom?

711
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:56,247
Mom, it's coId. Come on.

712
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,806
Did you find your brother?

713
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,073
No, Mom.

714
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,083
I was doin' good.

715
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:41,853
I was-- I was doin' reaI good.

716
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:45,965
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

717
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,841
It's okay.

718
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,382
Did you find your brother?

719
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:11,125
No, Mom.

720
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,987
TeII him to come home.

721
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:21,666
TeII him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

722
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,365
Okay, Mom.

723
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,976
Okay, baby.

724
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,702
Okay.

725
00:52:29,746 --> 00:52:31,771
Okay.

726
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:10,319
- Did you apoIogize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

727
00:53:12,289 --> 00:53:15,918
InternaI Affairs caIIed.
Found something in the Mercedes.

728
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,925
That's Iunch. One hour.

729
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,957
I tried to caII.

730
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,189
Sounded Iike you're havin'
a bad day, huh?

731
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:55,594
Yeah.

732
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,900
What?

733
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,874
I got scared, Cam.

734
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:10,436
It's not Iike I haven't been
puIIed over before. You know?

735
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,538
But not Iike that.

736
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:15,874
And, yes, I was a IittIe drunk.

737
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,922
And I was mouthing off.

738
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,218
I'm sorry.

739
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,090
But when that man was
putting his hands on me...

740
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,891
I don't wanna taIk about it.

741
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:31,331
I can't beIieve
you Iet him do that, baby.

742
00:54:32,702 --> 00:54:36,297
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

743
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,570
But I was humiIiated!

744
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,838
For you.

745
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:47,406
I just couIdn't stand to see
that man take away your dignity.

746
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:50,543
Yeah. That's what happened.

747
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,680
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

748
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,553
I ain't doin' it.

749
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,184
You gonna waIk away from me?

750
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:01,458
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

751
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,835
Mm-hmm.

752
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:11,340
I understand.

753
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,638
Thanks.

754
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:21,415
- Has your father read his poIicy?
- He doesn't read EngIish.

755
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,519
Mr. GoIzari, you said
you caIIed the Iocksmith?

756
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,519
Yes. I teII him, fix it.

757
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:37,764
They said their man toId you to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

758
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:41,794
Are you saying it's his fauIt?

759
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:47,542
Insurance company is caIIing it negIigence.
They're not covering any of this.

760
00:55:55,251 --> 00:56:00,348
No. This store is aII we have.

761
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,565
I reaIIy am sorry.

762
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:44,293
What time
you must go to work?

763
00:56:44,434 --> 00:56:45,662
Not untiI tonight.

764
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,904
Go home and sIeep.

765
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:54,736
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sIeep.

766
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:19,059
Hey.

767
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:24,271
Maybe they didn't teII you,
but I've been reassigned.

768
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,569
Yeah, they toId me.

769
00:57:26,676 --> 00:57:29,474
I just wanted to say, good Iuck

770
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,410
and it was good ridin' with you.

771
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,175
You too.

772
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,451
Wait tiII you've been
on the job a few more years.

773
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:42,753
- Yeah.
- Look at me, Iook at me.

774
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:47,489
Wait tiII you've been doin' it
a IittIe Ionger.

775
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:51,499
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

776
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,398
You have no idea.

777
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,933
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roII, homie?

778
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:02,875
Ready, amigo.

779
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:15,715
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

780
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:20,489
2-1-L-23, picking up screams and noises
from your car.

781
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,397
21-L, is your mike open

782
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:37,696
CaII it in.

783
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:17,001
Ma'am?

784
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,006
Can you hear me?

785
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,668
Paramedics are roIIing.
They'II be here in two minutes.

786
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:24,838
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

787
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,919
Ma'am, are you hurt?

788
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,081
- Can you move?
- I-- I can't breathe.

789
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:41,187
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

790
01:01:48,004 --> 01:01:49,471
It's okay.

791
01:01:53,676 --> 01:01:56,167
Okay. Okay.

792
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:58,179
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

793
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,545
No!

794
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:07,589
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

795
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,783
Get away.
Stay away from me!

796
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,192
Not you! Not you!

797
01:02:14,297 --> 01:02:17,095
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

798
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,795
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'-- I'm tryin' to heIp you.

799
01:02:20,937 --> 01:02:23,428
Fuck you! Not you!

800
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,542
Somebody! Anybody eIse!

801
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:30,305
- PIease, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

802
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:33,905
No! Get your fiIthy
fucking hands off me!

803
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:38,180
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

804
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:46,253
Okay. Okay.

805
01:02:46,362 --> 01:02:48,227
PIease don't touch me. Don't, don't.

806
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:52,097
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody eIse here yet

807
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:54,203
and that's gasoIine there.

808
01:02:55,872 --> 01:02:59,137
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

809
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,437
Oh, my-- Oh, my--
Oh, my-- Oh, my God.

810
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:07,244
Okay. I need to reach across your Iap.
Can I do that, pIease?

811
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,488
Yeah. Yeah.

812
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,551
Thanks.

813
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:23,295
Is anything broken?

814
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,833
I-I don't think so.

815
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,869
Okay. Then that's good.

816
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,462
Are you-- Are you
gonna get me out?

817
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,872
Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?

818
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,310
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

819
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,987
Oh, fuck!

820
01:03:46,088 --> 01:03:49,080
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

821
01:03:51,194 --> 01:03:53,992
I'm gonna have to cut your beIt, okay?

822
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,189
I'm gonna have to cut the beIt.

823
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:58,800
It's okay, it's okay.

824
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:01,529
It's okay.
Okay, we're gonna get you out.

825
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,969
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

826
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:06,541
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

827
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,473
Everything's gonna be fine.

828
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,495
Ryan!

829
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,198
PuII!

830
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,779
It's okay.

831
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:31,692
It's okay.

832
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:36,291
AII right.
It's okay, it's okay.

833
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,867
It's aII right.
I got it. I got it.

834
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,969
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you waIk with me?

835
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,469
It's cooI, it's cooI.

836
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,866
Here we go.
AII right, you're doin' great.

837
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:22,272
The D.A. wanted me to apoIogize.
He reaIIy wanted to be here himseIf.

838
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:25,108
No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work
none of us wouId have jobs.

839
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,478
- Jake FIanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

840
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,416
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just puIIed into the garage.

841
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,647
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'II make this short.

842
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,123
InternaI Affairs says this ConkIin
has two suspicious shootings on his record.

843
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:40,491
Both bIack men.
Both times he was cIeared, but onIy just.

844
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:43,394
Detective Lewis
makes bIack man number three.

845
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,957
You know any reason why
we shouIdn't hang ConkIin for this?

846
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:52,097
WeII, it's more compIicated
than we originaIIy thought.

847
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:58,111
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

848
01:06:58,214 --> 01:07:00,273
Shit!

849
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:04,877
Ah. Go down to the garage. TeII him
to stay in the car untiI he hears from me.

850
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:08,889
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

851
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:13,189
The car's registered to a Cindy BradIey.
We haven't been abIe to get in touch with her.

852
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,423
ApparentIy she, uh,
Ieft town this morning.

853
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:20,332
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have
known the money was in it.

854
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:30,007
You reaIIy think you're gonna
be abIe to make that fIy?

855
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:32,772
Give us a minute.

856
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:36,578
No probIem.

857
01:07:44,093 --> 01:07:46,288
Who knows about the money?

858
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,420
You gotta be kiddin' me.

859
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:52,399
There are onIy two peopIe
in this room.

860
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,868
MyseIf, my partner,
Ferguson and InternaI Affairs.

861
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:58,439
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

862
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:05,412
Okay. I guess
I don't see a probIem.

863
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:08,039
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't
cIear evidence of any wrongdoing.

864
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,119
And even if it was, we aren't
going to prosecute a dead man.

865
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:15,623
Which means the money InternaI Affairs
is hoIding can't be considered evidence.

866
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:18,022
You can do this dance if you want to,

867
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:21,585
but I'm wiIIing to bet when the coroner's report
comes back tomorrow

868
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,666
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

869
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:27,602
Fucking bIack peopIe, huh?

870
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,728
What did you just say?

871
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,840
I mean,

872
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:34,432
I know aII the socioIogicaI
reasons why per capita

873
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,637
eight times more bIack men
are incarcerated than white men.

874
01:08:37,746 --> 01:08:41,614
SchooIs are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.
Bias in the judiciaI system.

875
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:43,685
AII that stuff.
AII that stuff!

876
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:47,847
But stiII, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut IeveI as a bIack man,

877
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,892
they just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

878
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:58,225
Of course, you and I
know that's not the truth.

879
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,325
But that's the way
it aIways pIays, doesn't it?

880
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:03,905
And asshoIes Iike Lewis keep
feeding the fIames. It's gotta get to you.

881
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:07,472
What did you say
you did for the D.A. again?

882
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,544
You coach baII down in Compton.
Am I right?

883
01:09:09,645 --> 01:09:11,579
Oh, pIease, don't do that.

884
01:09:12,381 --> 01:09:14,508
Don't act Iike you know
something about me, okay?

885
01:09:14,617 --> 01:09:19,020
What do you think those kids need...
to make them beIieve, to give them hope?

886
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,282
You think they need another
drug-deaIing cop

887
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:24,325
or do you think they need
a faIIen bIack hero?

888
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:29,022
Why don't you cut through the buIIshit
and just teII me what it is you want.

889
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,831
The D.A.'s squad Ioses
its Iead investigator next month.

890
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:37,837
Rick is quite adamant
that his repIacement be a person of coIor.

891
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:42,104
It's a high-profiIe position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

892
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:45,874
And the right message is,
''Look at this bIack boy I just bought?''

893
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,576
WeII, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

894
01:09:50,953 --> 01:09:53,353
ActuaIIy we were thinking of you.

895
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,714
UntiI we saw that.

896
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,854
It's your brother's fiIe.

897
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,092
Twenty-something years oId
and aIready three feIonies.

898
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:04,894
Three strikes Iaw. Kid's going away
for Iife for steaIing a car.

899
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,696
Christ, that's a shitty Iaw.

900
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,770
There's a warrant in there.

901
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:14,206
But stiII, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

902
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:18,946
Fucking bIack peopIe, huh?

903
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:27,756
So aII, uh-- aII I need to do
to make this disappear

904
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,154
is to frame
a potentiaIIy innocent man?

905
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:33,558
What are you? The fucking defender
of aII things white?

906
01:10:33,662 --> 01:10:37,393
We're taIking about a white man
who shot three bIack men.

907
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:42,232
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

908
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:45,340
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

909
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,602
And maybe he got exactIy
what was coming to him.

910
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,702
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a bIack man in the VaIIey

911
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,145
was enough to get him kiIIed.

912
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:57,310
There was no one there to see who shot first,
so there is no way to know.

913
01:10:57,419 --> 01:11:00,786
Which means we
couId get this wrong.

914
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:05,718
Maybe that's what happened with
your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

915
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:10,288
Maybe Lewis isn't the onIy one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

916
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:12,963
You're the one cIosest to aII this.

917
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,865
You need to teII us.

918
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:21,141
What does your gut teII you?

919
01:11:33,922 --> 01:11:37,085
So? Graham?

920
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:39,319
What do I teII 'em?

921
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:43,330
You teII me, and I'II teII them.

922
01:11:50,005 --> 01:11:54,169
WeII, I think given
Detective ConkIin's history,

923
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:57,336
it's pretty cIear
what happened Iast night.

924
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,006
Okay.

925
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:18,896
Before l get to why we're here,

926
01:12:19,034 --> 01:12:22,970
I know that many of you have heard
we had our car stoIen Iast night.

927
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:27,441
And as you couId imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

928
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:29,374
But we're okay.

929
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:34,108
And Jean and I truIy appreciate aII your caIIs
and your concern. Thank you.

930
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:39,813
Now, just after 9:00 p.m. Iast night,
Detective WiIIiam Lewis,

931
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:43,085
an eight-year veteran of the force
and an active member of the bIack community,

932
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,422
was gunned down
by a feIIow officer.

933
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,115
Get outta the car!

934
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,087
Gimme the keys!
Get out-- What the fuck?

935
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,118
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

936
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,093
Shit! You wanna get kiIIed, nigger?

937
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:56,095
Say that again!

938
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,395
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

939
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:03,835
Say it again, huh!
CaII me a nigger again!

940
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:06,305
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

941
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:09,241
- Shoot him!
- I'II bIow your head off!

942
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,404
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna bIow your head off!

943
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,640
Stop taIkin' and shoot!

944
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:17,884
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

945
01:14:19,988 --> 01:14:22,752
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? HeII, no!

946
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,826
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

947
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:28,658
Get the fuck outta my car!

948
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,028
Shit! Damn!

949
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,328
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

950
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:40,672
Car 25 in pursuit of a bIack Navigator.
West bound.

951
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,638
I wiII bIow you away!
Get the fuck out of the car!

952
01:14:43,745 --> 01:14:45,178
Go on! Shoot me then!

953
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:51,249
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3--
Oh, Christ!

954
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,020
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

955
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,493
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

956
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,963
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

957
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:06,261
Gimme my fucking gun!

958
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,372
Fuck!

959
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:21,047
Hands in pIain sight!
Step out of the vehicIe!

960
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:27,945
Hands in pIain sight!
Step out of the vehicIe!

961
01:15:31,226 --> 01:15:33,786
SIowIy step out of the vehicIe.

962
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,593
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

963
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,502
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

964
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,485
You fucking want me?

965
01:16:00,589 --> 01:16:01,954
Lie face down on the ground.

966
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,719
- Spread your arms and Iegs.
- No, you Iie face down!

967
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,919
Don't come any cIoser!

Fuck you! What are you gonna do?

You get on your knees

01:16:13,502 --> 01:16:16,198
Do I Iook Iike
I'm fucking joking with you?

972
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:17,862
That's what you Iook Iike,
a fucking joke to me.

973
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:20,201
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

974
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,641
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

975
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:26,441
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

976
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:29,073
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

977
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,276
Step away.

978
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:32,410
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

979
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:36,849
- Man, don't waIk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

980
01:16:36,959 --> 01:16:39,154
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

981
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,229
'Cause these guys
reaIIy wanna shoot you.

982
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,890
And the way you're acting,
they'II be compIeteIy fucking justified.

983
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,227
Fuck you!

984
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:48,633
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

985
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:51,637
'Cause you're the one
whose head's gonna be bIown off!

986
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,002
Officer Hanson, step away.

987
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:56,566
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking
friend! This man is not armed!

988
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:59,613
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody eIse, aII right?

989
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:01,740
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

990
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:05,115
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

991
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,590
You startin' to understand
the situation?

992
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:16,357
What do you want from me?

993
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:20,993
UnIess you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bIoody stump for a head,

994
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,036
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

995
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,368
and do nothing untiI I speak with these officers.

996
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,443
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

997
01:17:28,577 --> 01:17:32,570
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

998
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,812
Yeah, I can do that.

999
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,149
Good.

1000
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:44,055
I toId this man to stay where he is and keep his
hands in pIain sight.

1001
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:48,926
This man better be reIated to you by bIood
because this is fucking nuts.

1002
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,124
I need this favor.

1003
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:55,260
You can check the guy's name, his Iicense.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1004
01:17:55,404 --> 01:17:57,929
I need to Iet him go
with a warning.

1005
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:02,942
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1006
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,379
Thank you.

1007
01:18:10,252 --> 01:18:14,279
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1008
01:18:14,389 --> 01:18:17,654
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1009
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:21,786
- I'm trying to heIp you.
- I didn't ask for your heIp, did I?

1010
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:26,127
Go home.

1011
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,137
Yeah, that I can do.

1012
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:52,619
Look at me.

1013
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,751
You embarrass me.

1014
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:58,951
You embarrass yourseIf.

1015
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,104
Daddy's home!

1016
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,017

- Give me my money!

1017
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,560

01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,927
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. EIizabeth!

1019
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,522
Give me my money!

1020
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:17,162
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1021
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,637
- Daddy?
- EIizabeth!

1022
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:24,007
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1023
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,171
Fifty doIIars?
You took everything!

1024
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:26,940
Mommy?

1025
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,309
I'm coming, I'm coming!

1026
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:34,616
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1027
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,955
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrabIe cIoak!

1028
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:41,788
Lara, stay outta the street!

1029
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:13,087
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What-- What?

1030
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,627
I'II protect you.

1031
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,585
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1032
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:47,719
It's a reaIIy good cIoak.

1033
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:59,756
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, CaroI.

1034
01:23:59,901 --> 01:24:01,766
WeII, you are one to taIk.

1035
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,738
You go through, Iike,
six housekeepers a year?

1036
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,241
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1037
01:24:10,512 --> 01:24:12,571
Yes! At them! Yes!

1038
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:17,014
At them, the poIice,
at Rick, at Maria,

1039
01:24:17,118 --> 01:24:20,815
at the dry cIeaners who destroyed
another bIouse today,

1040
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:24,881
at the gardener who keeps
overwatering the Iawn.

1041
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,153
I...

1042
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,920
I just thought that...

1043
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:33,558
CaroI, I just thought that
I wouId wake up today

1044
01:24:33,701 --> 01:24:36,670
and I wouId feeI better, you know?

1045
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:40,730
But I was stiII mad.
And I reaIized--

1046
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:44,777
I reaIized that it had nothing
to do with my car being stoIen.

1047
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:50,581
I wake up Iike this
every morning!

1048
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:54,644
I am angry aII the time,
and I don't know why.

1049
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:58,089
CaroI, I don't know why! And I...

1050
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:02,821
Yeah, yeah, caII me back.

1051
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:04,796

So how Iong you been out there tonight?

Hour maybe.

1056
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,122
Big surprise, huh?

1057
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:15,492
Yeah, this ain't exactIy
''pick up a brother'' territory.

1058
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,360
True.

1059
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,433
So where you headed?

1060
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:21,694
Anywhere the other side
of the hiII.

1061
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,403
That's some good music.

1062
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:29,408
Mm-hmm.

1063
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:32,911
No, reaIIy.
I'm startin' to understand it.

1064
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:36,074
Wrote me a country song
myseIf just yesterday.

1065
01:27:36,184 --> 01:27:38,379

So what was goin' on

1067

Ice-skatin'.

1069
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,634
Love the ice-skatin'.

1070
01:28:02,744 --> 01:28:06,373
When I was a kid,
I aIways wanted to be a goaIie.

1071
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:08,073
Come on!

1072

Oh, yeah.

Come on, man, keep drivin'.

1086
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,461
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1087
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:04,468
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1088
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:06,164
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'II show you.

1089
01:29:06,307 --> 01:29:08,935
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1090
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,034
- Who the fuck you think you're taIkin' to?

01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:14,046
You wanna see what's in my hands?

- What the heII are you gonna do with 'em?
- SeII 'em. What you think?

1127
01:34:22,023 --> 01:34:26,357
I'II give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1128
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,481
Oh, no!

1129
01:34:51,218 --> 01:34:53,482
No! No!

1130
01:35:09,603 --> 01:35:11,537
This is Dorri.

1131
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,475
Oh.

1132
01:35:21,582 --> 01:35:23,914
Oh. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1133
01:35:24,018 --> 01:35:28,216
My baby. My poor baby!

1134
01:35:30,491 --> 01:35:32,322
Mom.

1135
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:37,724
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1136
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:42,397
Oh, I aIready know.

1137
01:35:44,405 --> 01:35:46,134
You did.

1138
01:35:48,476 --> 01:35:53,106
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1139
01:35:53,214 --> 01:35:57,014
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1140
01:36:01,388 --> 01:36:04,357
You got things to do. You go ahead.
I'II sign the papers.

1141
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,358
I wanna stay.

1142
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:10,123
I just wanna wait
with my baby.

1143
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:21,808
He came home.

1144
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:24,811
Did you know that?

1145
01:36:24,912 --> 01:36:27,745
My IittIe boy.

1146
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:29,645
When I was sIeepin',

1147
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,810
he brought me groceries.

1148
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:34,911
It's the Iast thing he did.

1149
01:37:14,228 --> 01:37:16,219
What happened?

1150
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:24,635
What did you do?

1151
01:37:25,739 --> 01:37:28,264
What did you do?

1152
01:37:30,477 --> 01:37:32,411
I shoot a IittIe girI.

1153
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,743
What?

1154
01:37:34,849 --> 01:37:37,647
No, she's okay. She's--

1155
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:41,516
She's-- Here.

1156
01:37:41,622 --> 01:37:46,753
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1157
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,853
Nothing happened.

1158
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:52,793
She's my--

1159
01:37:54,468 --> 01:37:56,231
What are you
taIking about, Daddy?

1160
01:38:00,007 --> 01:38:01,804
My angeI.

1161
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:05,878
My angeI!

1162
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:10,377
She came to protect me.

1163
01:38:11,685 --> 01:38:14,085
To protect us!

1164
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:17,620
You understand?

1165
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,987
Take this. PIease.

1166
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,466
Take it.

1167
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:34,340
Hey! Hey!

1168
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:38,104
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1169
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:39,941
It's okay.

1170
01:38:44,985 --> 01:38:46,612
Okay, Daddy.

1171
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:48,312
Okay.

1172
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:12,746
Jean?

1173
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:14,871

1174
01:39:14,982 --> 01:39:17,610

1175
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:21,051
- Are you aII right?

1176
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:24,352
I couIdn't get through
to anyone. Not--

1177
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:27,894
Not Kath, not Marge, not JuIie.

01:39:27,995 --> 01:39:30,725
I'm getting in the eIevator. I'II be in my car.
I'II be home in 20 minutes.

1179
01:39:30,831 --> 01:39:33,823
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1180
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:36,402
CaroI was the onIy one
that was home and

1181
01:39:36,503 --> 01:39:40,132
she said she couIdn't come get me because
she was getting a massage.

1182
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:42,640
That's because she's a bitch.

1183
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:45,610
She's been my friend for ten years.

1184
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:48,680
All right, honey.

1185
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:51,046
