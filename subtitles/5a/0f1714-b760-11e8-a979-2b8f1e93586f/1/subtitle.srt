1
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,278
<i>You looked at Ray and said,</i>
<i>"I want him to be my boyfriend...</i>

2
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:31,616
<i>...but he's got to change."</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

3
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:35,912
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>that initiated a misunderstanding...</i>

4
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,125
<i>...was that one day,</i>
<i>I didn't want to have sex with him.</i>

5
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,796
<i>So he starts talking about</i>
<i>calling somebody else to do it.</i>

6
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,174
<i>Oh, no.</i>

7
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,805
<i>Stop at 4000 and a spin.</i>

8
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:55,223
<i>That's not why it happened.</i>

9
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,268
<i>You'd been drinking, and you thought</i>
<i>you were making love to me.</i>

10
00:00:58,435 --> 00:00:59,728
<i>Yes.</i>

11
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:06,484
<i>- This differs from a normal massage?</i>
<i>- It's more sexual.</i>

12
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,070
<i>I ought to know when I see</i>
<i>a good ball.</i>

13
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,829
<i>- Jamie, I...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

14
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:25,795
<i>This television funny-man</i>
<i>killed his brother in cold blood.</i>

15
00:01:25,962 --> 00:01:29,674
<i>My guests have crushes</i>
<i>on food service workers.</i>

16
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:34,179
<i>Mr. Davis, do you take</i>
<i>cream and sugar in your eye?</i>

17
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:40,226
<i>- Get out.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

18
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:44,814
<i>Do you want to tell them</i>
<i>something?</i>

19
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,109
<i>I'm really a man.</i>

20
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,207
Jesus. Where's the cable guy
already?

21
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:14,469
Rick Legatos, please.

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,263
Hey, Phil.

23
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:23,853
- Hey, Rick, phone.
- Hello? Hey, how's the move going?

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,901
The cable guy is missing in action.
I hope he gets here before I die.

25
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:35,114
- You haven't called Robin?
- No. I'm giving her her space.

26
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:40,245
- I can't believe she's doing this.
- You shouldn't have proposed.

27
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,541
All she had to do was say no.
She didn't have to kick me out.

28
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:48,962
- Let's go!
- Just give me a minute!

29
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,298
<i>Listen, a piece of advice:</i>

30
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:58,388
Slip the cable guy 50 bucks, he'll give
you all the movie channels for free.

31
00:02:58,555 --> 00:03:03,601
I'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no?

32
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:06,771
None of them say no.

33
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:10,692
<i>- I've got to go. Talk to you later.</i>
- All right.

34
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:20,618
<i>Hi, this is Robin Harris.</i>
<i>Steven doesn't live here anymore...</i>

35
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,351
- Cable guy.
- Oh, great.

36
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:52,358
- Cable guy!
- Don't leave!

37
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,573
- Wait!
- Cable guy!

38
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,492
- I'm coming!
- Cable guy!

39
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,661
I'm coming. Don't leave.

40
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,166
Cable guy!

41
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,506
Hey, wait! Come back.

42
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:23,181
- Look who decided to show.
- You should have come hours ago.

43
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:28,311
Should I? So I'm the tardy one?

44
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:33,024
Yeah. I was going to the
bed-and-bath place. Now it's closed.

45
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:37,862
Maybe I shouldn't have come at all.
Jerk off!

46
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:42,033
I'm just joking with you.

47
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,078
Let's do this.

48
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,414
The old McNair place.

49
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,459
Never thought they'd get
the floors clean after what happened.

50
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,378
What happened?

51
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,964
They had a lot of cats.

52
00:04:57,465 --> 00:05:00,385
The comment card.
Please mail it in when I'm done.

53
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,678
Does it go to your boss?

54
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,932
No, it goes to me.
I'm kind of a perfectioniss...

55
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:11,896
Perfectionis...t.

56
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,358
Let's take a look.

57
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:23,241
This could be a cool pad.

58
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,538
Come on, baby.

59
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:34,419
Come on, baby. Talk to me.

60
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:39,424
Tell me where you like it.

61
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:48,766
Hello, mama.

62
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:56,107
Is this what you want?
Is this where you need it?

63
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:03,823
How about this?

64
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,959
That's your sweet spot, right there.

65
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,301
So your lady kicked you out.

66
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:26,637
What?

67
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:29,474
In preparing your service...

68
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,437
...I noticed you were previously wired
at 1268 and a half Chestnut.

69
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:39,609
Last week, the billing
was transferred to one Robin Harris.

70
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,656
- Smells like heartbreak to me.
- I don't want to discuss that.

71
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:50,703
- Just instal my cable, please.
- Suit yourself.

72
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,247
No sweat off my sack.

73
00:06:54,832 --> 00:06:58,169
You might want to
put on a bathing suit.

74
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:02,340
You'll be channel surfing
in no time.

75
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:22,193
<i>So ends day 54 of the trial</i>
<i>of former child star, Sam Sweet...</i>

76
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,531
<i>...who has been accused of shooting</i>
<i>his twin brother, Stan, in cold blood.</i>

77
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:30,034
<i>The twins were stars of</i>
<i>the hit sitcom</i> Double Trouble...

78
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,912
<i>...which aired from 1977 till 1984.</i>

79
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:34,747
Who broke this?

80
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,874
- He did it!
- He did it!

81
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:42,713
<i>Life wasn't sweet</i>
<i>after their programme was cancelled.</i>

82
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,050
<i>Sam turned to petty larceny...</i>

83
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,597
<i>...while his brother fell in with the cult</i>
<i>called Brotherhood of Friends.</i>

84
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,769
I hope they fry this bastard.

85
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:09,198
What happened?

86
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:14,579
Your furniture and appliances were
causing problems with the reception.

87
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,419
- I moved a few things, okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

88
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,922
I just have some paperwork
for you to fill out.

89
00:08:25,882 --> 00:08:30,928
It's a drag. You just get to know
somebody and then the job is done.

90
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:33,931
Sign here.

91
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,070
I feel good about this.

92
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,288
- Hey, wait.
- Yeah?

93
00:08:57,872 --> 00:09:03,836
I have this friend,
and he gave his cable guy $50.

94
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:09,133
He got all the movie channels for free.
Did you ever hear of that?

95
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:22,688
- You mean illegal cable?
- Yeah.

96
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:26,525
- Who told you that?
- Forget it.

97
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:27,985
You're offering me a bribe.

98
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:35,034
That's illegal. You could be fined
up to $5000 or go to jail.

99
00:09:35,201 --> 00:09:39,121
No, I was just making conversation.
Forget it.

100
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:47,421
I'm just jerking your chain.

101
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,801
You are too easy.

102
00:09:51,968 --> 00:09:55,763
Wake up. Smell the smelling salt.

103
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,058
I'll juice you up.

104
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,855
- One guy doing another guy a solid.
- That is so nice.

105
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:09,902
Well, you're a nice guy.
Many customers treat me like snot.

106
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:13,030
Like I'm a goddamn plumber
or something.

107
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:17,326
Here's my personal pager number.

108
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:24,208
- The company puts you on hold.
- Thanks. You'll get good marks.

109
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:29,213
Maybe I'll show you the satellite,
how this whole thing works.

110
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,301
- Sure, we should do that one day.
- How about tomorrow?

111
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:40,891
- Tomorrow's no good.
- You'll be stewing about your ex?

112
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,936
No.

113
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:53,362
- Okay. I crossed the line. Sorry.
- You didn't cross the line.

114
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:56,907
Cool. Pick you up at 6:30.

115
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:05,875
There are 24 classrooms.
Each can be converted into a home.

116
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:12,423
There's a swimming pool,
tennis courts, a gym and a stage...

117
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,052
...if the residents decide
they want to perform <i>Oklahoma!</i>

118
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,928
<i>Oklahoma!</i>

119
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:22,433
It's available in foreclosure.

120
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,145
With a cash bid,
we can steal this thing.

121
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:36,947
Yo, Steve-o.

122
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:40,034
Tough room, but you got them.
How you feeling?

123
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,327
Fine.

124
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:45,581
Are you having
a little domestic discord?

125
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:50,961
Robin and I are having difficulties.
I think it's only temporary.

126
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:57,426
If you screw this project up,
it's not going to be my ass.

127
00:11:57,593 --> 00:12:00,763
- Do you know what I mean?
- I'm on it.

128
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,101
<i>I'm more patient. I'm more loving.</i>
<i>They tell me this.</i>

129
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:09,980
<i>There's something in everyone's life</i>
<i>they could improve.</i>

130
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:16,612
<i>If they're doing well financially,</i>
<i>maybe their relationships suffer.</i>

131
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:23,661
<i>Call now, and you'll be rushed the</i>
<i>"Personal Power Success System."</i>

132
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:30,251
Steve! Steven!

133
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:34,171
Stevie, time to leavie!

134
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:36,173
Yo, Stevie!

135
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:42,847
Come on down!
Are you waiting for an invitation?

136
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:45,766
It's the fun bus. Come on!

137
00:12:50,688 --> 00:12:53,816
- How's it going?
- Hey, buddy!

138
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,862
I've had a few drinks, so buckle up.

139
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:04,493
That's my humour.
Thanks for coming out.

140
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:10,875
Most people never take the time
to understand how the cable works.

141
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:17,339
- Where exactly are we going?
- To ride the information highway.

142
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,327
I come up here to think sometimes.
Clear my head.

143
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:49,038
Brace yourself.

144
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:54,251
There she is.

145
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:06,805
She's sending entertainment and
information to millions of citizens.

146
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:14,230
- That's pretty impressive.
- I knew you'd appreciate this.

147
00:14:20,736 --> 00:14:22,947
The future is now!

148
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:27,660
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer.

149
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:32,790
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

150
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:38,337
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

151
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:43,300
There's no end to the possibilities!

152
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:50,474
When I was a kid, my mom worked
nights. I never met my father.

153
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:55,312
- But the TV was always there.
- I know what you mean.

154
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:58,357
My dad might as well
have been away.

155
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:06,156
That's tough. You must have
a lot of abandonment issues.

156
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,618
Reality isn't <i>Father Knows Best</i>
anymore.

157
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:14,123
It's a kick in the face
with a steel-toe work boot...

158
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:20,296
...and a trip to the hospital
for reconstructive surgery.

159
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,466
But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

160
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:30,222
My brother is a speech therapist.

161
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,518
So?

162
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,230
Never mind.

163
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:46,322
- You're pretty love-struck, huh?
- I miss her.

164
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:51,744
- I proposed, and she kicked me out.
- I hate that.

165
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:58,709
- She said I pressed too hard.
- Women are a labyrinth, my friend.

166
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,629
Can I be frank?

167
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:08,927
I don't think you listen to her.
You tell her what she wants to hear.

168
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,891
She wants you to thirst
for knowledge about who she is.

169
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:17,561
All the complicated splendour
that is woman.

170
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:24,735
When your love is truly giving,
it will come back to you tenfold.

171
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,864
You're right.
That's incredibly insightful.

172
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:33,410
It was Jerry Springer's
final thought on Friday's show.

173
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:46,090
Women love <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>.
It's on HBO this month.

174
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,927
- That's your bait.
- Robin loves that movie.

175
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:57,559
Tell her you're cooking yourself
dinner and watching it by yourself.

176
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:02,815
- She'll come running.
- Maybe I'll give it a try.

177
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:07,611
It's embarrassing,
I don't even know your name.

178
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:11,281
Do you really want to know
my name?

179
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,493
- You do?
- Sure.

180
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:27,005
It's Ernie Douglas.
But my friends call me Chip.

181
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,813
Goodbye.

182
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,360
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

183
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:53,699
I don't listen to you.
I pretend to understand.

184
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:57,286
I'm just saying
what I think you want to hear.

185
00:17:57,453 --> 00:18:04,001
I'm interested in learning about the
complicated splendour that is you.

186
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:12,509
I can see that taking this time
might be good for us. I'm not mad.

187
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:19,308
- Sometimes time apart is healthy.
- You're right.

188
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,980
That's what I came here to say.

189
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,067
I have to get back to the office.

190
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,992
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Cook dinner and watch a movie.

191
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:41,789
- <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> is on TV.
- I love that movie.

192
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,375
Why don't you come by?

193
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:48,879
- Maybe I will.
- Whatever.

194
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:59,097
<i>I'm Tabitha Soren.</i>
<i>Today in the Sam Sweet case...</i>

195
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:04,353
<i>...the prosecution played the call</i>
<i>Sam made on the night of the murder.</i>

196
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,689
<i>Mr. Sweet confessed</i>
<i>one month later.</i>

197
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:12,194
<i>Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>
<i>My twin brother's been shot.</i>

198
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,155
<i>I think it was an Asian gang</i>
<i>or something.</i>

199
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:17,574
<i>I saw someone. He looked Asian.</i>

200
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:23,622
<i>He was speaking another language.</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure...</i>

201
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,291
<i>It was Asian.</i>

202
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:41,515
He had the same injury last year.

203
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,435
You guys play here too?

204
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:51,942
Weird. I thought I'd see if anybody
wanted to play round ball.

205
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,738
- Great. We need another man.
- Chip Douglas, my cable guy.

206
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,742
We met a week ago,
but I feel I've always known him.

207
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:04,329
Really? That's sweet.

208
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,459
- Chip Douglas, you're on my team.
- No way.

209
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:14,882
- I'm on Steven's team.
- I'll switch teams. Let's play.

210
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,385
I've got to warm up!
I don't want to pull a hammy.

211
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:48,790
- Let's get it on.
- You any good?

212
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:51,501
You'll find out.

213
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,295
Check it.

214
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,341
Looks good.

215
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:02,721
Let's see what you got,
White Shadow.

216
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:04,765
Foul!

217
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:10,145
- That was a travel!
- Whatever you say, Chip!

218
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,190
I see.
We're playing prison rules, huh?

219
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,023
Feed me!

220
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:04,866
Steven, I'm open!
Feed me the rock!

221
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,121
Chip, over here!

222
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,950
I love this game.

223
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:53,790
- I guess we're done.
- Thanks for bringing your friend.

224
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,798
Hey, Rick! I never made a slam dunk
before. Thanks for the boost.

225
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,804
What are you doing?

226
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:12,976
- I'm just talking trash.
- You ruined the game.

227
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:17,814
Friends don't speak to each other
like that.

228
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:22,319
We're not friends.
I don't even know you.

229
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:27,908
- Let me buy you a Heineken.
- I'm going home.

230
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:33,538
I guess we'll talk later.
I have to do some stuff anyway.

231
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>- You have 11 new messages.</i>
- All right.

232
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:53,183
<i>Steven, it's Mom. Call me.</i>
<i>I'm still your mother, you know.</i>

233
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,978
<i>Steven, call your mother.</i>

234
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:02,692
<i>Hey, Steven. Give me a ring.</i>
<i>I'm at 555-4329.</i>

235
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:08,657
<i>What's up, Steve? I'm at a pay phone.</i>
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

236
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:12,202
<i>I'll be home later.</i>

237
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:17,249
<i>Okay, I'm home.</i>
<i>Give me a buzz when you get in.</i>

238
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:22,420
<i>It's me again. I was taking a whiz.</i>
<i>Thought you might have called.</i>

239
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,467
<i>We're having ourselves</i>
<i>a game of phone tag here.</i>

240
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:35,559
<i>I was just blow-drying my hair.</i>
<i>Thought I heard the phone ring.</i>

241
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,396
<i>I think your machine is--</i>

242
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:43,150
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

243
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,661
- Hey, good to see you.
- You too.

244
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:08,550
- So how's work?
- Work's good.

245
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:14,890
- How's Hal?
- The guy has no vision.

246
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:20,687
It's like working for Mr. Magoo.
And those hair plugs...

247
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:26,484
He's just an utterly useless person.
I think I hate him.

248
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:34,951
- It's nice to see you doing well.
- It's nice just to see you.

249
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,872
Hey. It should be on now.

250
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:53,887
Damn it. The cable's out.

251
00:25:54,804 --> 00:26:00,352
I know what to do.
The cable guy is a friend of mine.

252
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:05,941
I'm a preferred customer.
All I have to do is page him.

253
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:25,835
- Hi. Is there a problem?
- My cable's out.

254
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,508
Really? So you called me.

255
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,304
Funny, how you call
when you need something.

256
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:42,686
- Is that how you treat people?
- I've been busy. Robin is here.

257
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:50,151
- This is important.
- But calling me back isn't?

258
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:52,445
I'm sorry. Can you help me out?

259
00:26:55,657 --> 00:27:01,037
Why should I help you?
I gave you free cable.

260
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:05,417
- What have you ever done for me?
- Anything you want.

261
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:09,671
- Tomorrow night we hang out.
- Fine, anything you want.

262
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:17,512
God bless you.
You're too good to me.

263
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:28,857
All set!

264
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:38,908
- What's with the cut cord?
- That's for effect. Until tomorrow.

265
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:43,288
She's pretty. Don't kiss her.
Don't even touch her.

266
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:48,793
Resist the urge at all costs.
It'll pay off in the end.

267
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,505
See what I'm saying?

268
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,803
Enjoy the flick.

269
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,226
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

270
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:09,939
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Don't I look fine?

271
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:16,321
<i>That isn't how it's done.</i>
<i>I'd rather just see somebody I like.</i>

272
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:22,118
<i>Get a feeling about them,</i>
<i>and ask them if they'd like a drink.</i>

273
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:26,498
<i>- Or a slice of pizza?</i>
<i>- Does it still work this way?</i>

274
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:30,794
<i>- It doesn't. They ask you.</i>
<i>- I'm starting to notice that.</i>

275
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,923
<i>If you get a new wife,</i>
<i>do you get to have sex with her?</i>

276
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:40,345
<i>- I certainly hope so.</i>
<i>- Will she scratch up your back?</i>

277
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,639
<i>What?</i>

278
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:47,310
<i>In movies, women always scratch</i>
<i>the man when they're having sex.</i>

279
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:50,647
<i>- How do you know this?</i>
<i>- Jed's got cable.</i>

280
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:08,123
- Mommy's got to go out now.
- When will I get a brother?

281
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:11,501
That's why Mommy is going
to happy hour.

282
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:16,965
Just sit there with Mr. Babysitter,
and he'll take good care of you.

283
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,927
Don't sit so close to that thing.
It's going to rot your brain.

284
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:29,894
<i>- Why didn't you take my call?</i>
<i>- I can't always pick up the phone.</i>

285
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:35,233
<i>Your nostrils flare</i>
<i>when you're mad.</i>

286
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:48,538
Sorry about yesterday.
How did everything go with you?

287
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,417
- Keep them closed.
- Pretty well. The other night...

288
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,004
You're not peeking, are you?
I want this to be a surprise.

289
00:29:56,171 --> 00:30:01,885
- Where are we going?
- The finest restaurant in town.

290
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:06,473
Open, sesame.

291
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,559
Medieval Times?

292
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:16,232
I knew you'd like it.
I come twice a week.

293
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,906
I'm your serving wench, Melinda.
Care for something from the barkeep?

294
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:27,785
Dost thust have thou a mug of ale
for me and me mate?

295
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:34,626
He has been pitched in battle for
a fortnight and has a king's thirst.

296
00:30:36,461 --> 00:30:41,257
- I'll be right back, My Lord.
- My thanks to ye, fair wench.

297
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,430
Thanks.

298
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:54,062
- Look, I have to tell you--
- Hold that thought. Show's on.

299
00:30:54,229 --> 00:31:00,652
Welcome to a magnificent journey
into the past.

300
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:04,906
This is Medieval Times!

301
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:12,413
Are you prepared for a night
of feasting and sport...

302
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,459
...the likes of which
you'll never forget?

303
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:21,839
Stand up and cheer
for your section's knight.

304
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:26,302
Let the games begin!
The blue knight rules!

305
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:31,474
The red knight sucks the big one!
You're going down, red knight!

306
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:35,812
Going down, down, down!
Red knight going down!

307
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,232
Down, down, down.
Red knight going down!

308
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,988
Smite him!

309
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:53,955
- Could I get a knife and fork?
- There were none in mediaeval times.

310
00:31:54,122 --> 00:31:58,126
- More Pepsi?
- There was Pepsi, but no utensils?

311
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,545
I've got a lot of tables.

312
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:10,179
Can I have your skin?
Check this out.

313
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:21,149
<i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

314
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:25,194
Hello, Clarice.
It's good to see you again.

315
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:29,657
Oh, Lord.

316
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:33,870
This has nothing to do with you
as a person--

317
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:37,332
We have reached the climax
of our competition.

318
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:42,879
Two noblemen from our audience
will battle to the death...

319
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:44,922
...to resolve a grievance.

320
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:52,096
Master Steven Kovacs and Lord Chip,
come to the fighting pit!

321
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:56,517
- Let's go.
- What's going on?

322
00:32:56,684 --> 00:33:00,730
- We're going to do battle.
- Is this a normal part of the show?

323
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:06,569
No, but I give all the knights
free cable.

324
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:10,907
- Is it safe?
- Sure! That's what the armour's for.

325
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:17,288
We have to be careful
not to hurt each other, right?

326
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:23,753
I cannot listen to you,
for you are my sworn enemy.

327
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:32,428
Just take it easy, all right?

328
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:43,147
Nice move.

329
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:48,611
Necessity is the mother of invention.

330
00:33:51,781 --> 00:33:55,618
Come back so that I may brain thee!

331
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:04,127
My leg! I have a cramp.

332
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:05,962
Are you all right?

333
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,967
I am now.

334
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:21,561
Oh, my God!

335
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,655
That's the spirit.
Let's give them a show!

336
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:53,009
I'm blinded! My eyes!

337
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:58,931
I don't believe you.
It's another trick.

338
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:04,937
So that's how it's going to be?
You want to play rough?

339
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,316
Daddy can play rough!

340
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:16,741
This is like when Spock fought Kirk.
Best friends forced to do battle.

341
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:41,682
Chip, this isn't funny! Stop it!

342
00:35:43,184 --> 00:35:49,273
The name is Spock. If we don't fight
to the death, they'll kill us both.

343
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,068
This isn't <i>Star Trek</i>.

344
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,408
Goodbye, Jim.

345
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:20,930
Good fight. Good fight.

346
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:24,267
Eat! Keep eating!

347
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:30,773
Quickly! Muster atop your steed.

348
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:37,780
Get on the friggin' horse.
I don't think he's kidding.

349
00:36:38,823 --> 00:36:43,744
- Don't do this!
- Good luck to you!

350
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,373
- This is our destiny!
- No, it's not!

351
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,376
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't! No, it isn't!

352
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:52,962
- Is! Is!
- Isn't! Isn't!

353
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,599
Are you all right?

354
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,817
Well done, good sir.
You are the victor.

355
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,571
But we will meet again.

356
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,170
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

357
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,506
Did you hear that?

358
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:45,181
- You have a warrior's instinct.
- I had a real feeling of power.

359
00:37:45,348 --> 00:37:49,810
If Robin had seen you,
she'd be begging you to come back.

360
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:52,772
These knights get laid all the time.

361
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:55,566
We should go again next week.

362
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:01,781
<i>- You have no messages.</i>
- Nobody loves you.

363
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:09,538
I left something in the living room.
Will you check it out for me?

364
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:13,709
Just a little piece of equipment.

365
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:23,135
- What do you think?
- What is all this?

366
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,143
It appears as if someone has updated
your home entertainment system.

367
00:38:33,646 --> 00:38:38,859
I got you the big-screen TV,
deluxe karaoke machine...

368
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:44,532
...and THX-quality sound that would
make George Lucas cream his pants.

369
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:47,576
You got in here when I was out?

370
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:51,747
How else could I get the stuff in?

371
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,876
- How much did all of this cost?
- Practically nothing.

372
00:38:56,043 --> 00:39:01,424
I have a connection.
I hook him up, he hooks me up.

373
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,053
- I can't accept this.
- Why not?

374
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,433
You give me something
more valuable. Friendship.

375
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:12,935
You give me friendship. We're even.

376
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:17,440
You have to take this stuff back.

377
00:39:21,444 --> 00:39:22,862
Okay.

378
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:28,951
- Can I leave it here till Saturday?
- Sure. No problem.

379
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:31,454
<i>Hi, this is Robin Harris.</i>

380
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:35,624
<i>Steven doesn't live here anymore...</i>

381
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:41,213
Hey, it's Steven.
I'm still trying to reach you.

382
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,884
I'm at the office. Call me. Bye.

383
00:39:46,093 --> 00:39:48,012
- How's it going?
- Good.

384
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:52,308
Good. Keep it up. It's your ass.

385
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,312
<i>It's Robin on line two.</i>

386
00:39:57,772 --> 00:40:02,568
I had the best time the other night.
When will I see you again?

387
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:08,491
- How about tomorrow?
- Chip.

388
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:12,328
I knew I'd get you
on the phone that way.

389
00:40:12,495 --> 00:40:17,833
Let's break the cherry
on that karaoke machine.

390
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,671
- What does that mean?
<i>- Karaoke jam. No ifs, ands or buts.</i>

391
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:28,302
Maybe a few buts. Big ones!

392
00:40:49,657 --> 00:40:52,743
You're going on a date?

393
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:59,875
We're not officially back together.
And you said time apart is good.

394
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:05,297
Yes. Time apart from each other,
but not with other people.

395
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:07,466
<i>That's time with someone else.</i>

396
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:12,596
<i>- I love you, but I have to go. Bye.</i>
- Bye.

397
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:24,650
This is just a sign
that you need to live a little.

398
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,864
- She's having fun. You should too.
- Maybe you're right.

399
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,283
You're damn right, I'm right.

400
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:39,874
- I got you a little something.
- You said we were even.

401
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,670
You're breaking the rules.
What is it?

402
00:41:48,757 --> 00:41:53,429
LOSE YOUR LISP
IN 30 DAYS

403
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,057
My brother thought
it might help you.

404
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:03,439
- This is... There's no words...
- It's no big deal.

405
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:07,026
Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It is to me.

406
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,571
Now I'm on a mission.

407
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:17,494
This is going to be
the best damn karaoke jam ever.

408
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,590
We're really bopping!

409
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:38,265
- You have some nice friends.
- They're just preferred customers.

410
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:43,103
Chick alert, 2 o'clock.
What a liquorice.

411
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:50,277
- Don't look.
- You're just playing with me.

412
00:42:50,444 --> 00:42:54,865
- She's all over you.
- Shut up.

413
00:42:55,491 --> 00:43:01,538
I'd strike while the iron is hot.
He who hesitates, masturbates.

414
00:43:01,705 --> 00:43:03,374
Go.

415
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:11,548
- Hey. I'm Steven.
- Heather.

416
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:16,178
- Can I get you a beer?
- How about a tequila?

417
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,180
All right.

418
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,602
Hi, Rick.

419
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,356
That'll be a good one.

420
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,861
- Glad you accepted my invitation.
- Steven invited me.

421
00:43:33,028 --> 00:43:36,448
He's having a super time.

422
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:43,831
He's changing. You'll have to learn
to live with that.

423
00:43:46,583 --> 00:43:52,840
I don't know what your story is,
but I'm going to find out.

424
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:59,680
Don't dig too deep. You might
get burned by the molten lava.

425
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,559
I'm out of here.

426
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:13,360
Thank you.

427
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:20,909
The soothing sounds of Raul,
ladies and gentlemen.

428
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,830
- You had honey in your voice.
- Do a song for us.

429
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:27,750
No, I couldn't. No, I really couldn't.

430
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,838
All right, already!

431
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:37,092
I fought the law, and the law won.

432
00:44:38,886 --> 00:44:44,099
Jefferson Airplane performed
this song in <i>Gimme Shelter...</i>

433
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:49,438
...a film about how the Hell's Angels
had their way at a Stones concert.

434
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:53,150
Tonight, it's my turn.

435
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:28,519
- What do you do?
- Can we talk in the other room?

436
00:45:28,685 --> 00:45:30,312
All right.

437
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:56,106
We just had a baby born
at the party.

438
00:46:56,273 --> 00:47:00,736
We need an ambulance
over by the scaffolding!

439
00:47:19,463 --> 00:47:25,969
It's the summer of love, baby.
Let's leave these two alone.

440
00:47:26,178 --> 00:47:30,224
Smile!
That's going to be a good one.

441
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:50,410
Good morning,
and how are we today?

442
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:55,290
I borrowed this sweatshirt.
Bacon and eggs, coming up.

443
00:47:55,457 --> 00:48:00,921
- Where did Heather go?
- She left early this morning.

444
00:48:01,088 --> 00:48:03,298
You cad.

445
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:11,014
- What a night. Just what I needed.
- I'll tell you something.

446
00:48:11,473 --> 00:48:15,477
- You look like a new man.
- I feel like a new man.

447
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:20,482
I was getting so used to rejection.
I really liked her.

448
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,777
Hey. It was my treat.

449
00:48:26,989 --> 00:48:33,161
- What do you mean?
- You can buy next time.

450
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:40,043
- Don't let your eggs get cold.
- Buy what?

451
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:47,175
What do you mean, buy what?
The women.

452
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:52,598
Do you mean
that Heather is a prostitute?

453
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,812
Of course. We couldn't get
a woman like that without paying.

454
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,773
This can't be happening.

455
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,985
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

456
00:49:05,152 --> 00:49:11,325
It's okay. She's totally clean.
I checked her out about a week ago.

457
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:18,332
To make sure she was good.
And I'm healthy as a horse. Not a drip.

458
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:26,048
- Would you like some juice?
- You're kidding. She's your friend.

459
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:31,094
- I wish I had friends like that.
- Get out of my house.

460
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:35,891
She was a working girl,
but she liked you.

461
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:39,728
You might even have got a freebie.

462
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:45,067
I don't ever want to see you again.
Robin will never forgive me.

463
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:49,029
Don't tell her.
I'll help you get her back.

464
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:53,408
I want you out of my apartment.
And get this stuff out of here.

465
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:58,538
Why are you doing this?
You're sabotaging yourself.

466
00:49:58,705 --> 00:50:01,249
Out. Now.

467
00:50:01,416 --> 00:50:05,087
Everything was going so well.

468
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:09,383
I made you breakfast,
and we were eating...

469
00:50:09,549 --> 00:50:11,927
Out!

470
00:50:12,094 --> 00:50:16,973
I'll fix this.
I can make it cool again.

471
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,018
This is just a speed bump!

472
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:28,610
- May I help you?
- No. I'm meeting someone here.

473
00:50:41,498 --> 00:50:45,460
I apologise about last night.
I came home and I just fell asleep.

474
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:57,681
Most appreciated.

475
00:50:59,391 --> 00:51:04,479
Gail tells me
you're coming out of a relationship.

476
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:10,485
- We're in a holding pattern.
- A holding pattern?

477
00:51:10,652 --> 00:51:14,072
You need to come down and refuel.

478
00:51:16,408 --> 00:51:18,660
You're sexy.

479
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:27,753
You've been working hard.
Take a break.

480
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:39,181
Excuse me.
What's the story with our chicken?

481
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:46,229
Have the eggs had a chance to hatch?
Maybe you can go check on it for me.

482
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:50,025
I'm sorry to put you out.

483
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:52,736
Unbelievable.

484
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:57,073
I'm hysterical now.
What were we talking about?

485
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:00,368
What's your job like?

486
00:52:00,535 --> 00:52:05,207
It's a little crazy right now...

487
00:52:05,373 --> 00:52:12,214
Wait. I need to use the head.
I want to find out about your job.

488
00:52:13,006 --> 00:52:15,550
What's with the chicken?

489
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:24,559
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

490
00:52:25,227 --> 00:52:28,063
- Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Stretch.

491
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:33,735
- Pleasant night, isn't it?
- Yeah, not too bad.

492
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:39,908
The weather is always nice in here.
The winters are remarkably mild!

493
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:52,128
- If you need anything, let me know.
- I got it under control.

494
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:55,966
- Unbelievable.
- It's no trouble.

495
00:52:56,132 --> 00:52:58,468
What is your--?

496
00:52:59,386 --> 00:53:03,932
People rarely take advantage of
my services. I'll help you wash up.

497
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:07,018
Cleanliness is next to godliness.

498
00:53:10,939 --> 00:53:13,191
You're on a big date.

499
00:53:15,235 --> 00:53:17,946
You'll need to look your best.

500
00:53:21,157 --> 00:53:26,580
That'll take care of the shine.
Now, let's pluck those eyebrows!

501
00:53:26,746 --> 00:53:30,292
She loves me, she loves me not.
She loves me...

502
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:34,296
...she loves me not.

503
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:37,549
A little José Eber...

504
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,555
...a touch of Alfalfa...

505
00:53:43,722 --> 00:53:47,851
...and... we're ready to dry you off!

506
00:53:48,977 --> 00:53:52,480
Right into the buckle.
That's got to hurt!

507
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:59,195
Suck the air.

508
00:53:59,362 --> 00:54:02,991
You look just like Dizzy Gillespie.

509
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:21,635
Don't worry about the tip.
But I've got one for you.

510
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:25,847
Stay away from Robin. She's taken.

511
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:40,070
<i>A man was beaten in a restroom</i>
<i>by a bathroom attendant.</i>

512
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:47,035
<i>The victim is unable to speak, but</i>
<i>witnesses described the assailant.</i>

513
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:48,244
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

514
00:54:48,411 --> 00:54:52,582
<i>Tonight on UPN: The trial</i>
<i>that has captured the nation.</i>

515
00:54:52,749 --> 00:54:58,171
<i>Everyone awaits the verdict,</i>
<i>but we're showing the movie now.</i>

516
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:01,716
<i>- Crybaby.</i>
<i>- I love you.</i>

517
00:55:01,883 --> 00:55:07,389
<i>- No, Sammy!</i>
<i>- Look who's crying now.</i>

518
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:13,687
<i>Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet</i>
<i>in</i> Brother Sweet Brother.

519
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,231
<i>Parental discretion advised.</i>

520
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:32,747
- Who is it?
- It's the cable guy.

521
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:36,251
My cable's fine.

522
00:55:36,418 --> 00:55:41,965
I have an upgrade order
for one Robin Harris.

523
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,634
I didn't order that.

524
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:50,807
I guess you have a secret admirer.

525
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:57,313
- Is it a man named Steven?
- I can't say.

526
00:55:57,772 --> 00:56:00,775
- Come on.
- I promised Steven I wouldn't say.

527
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:03,111
Oh, look what I've done.

528
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:08,366
- You didn't hear it from me.
- Hold on.

529
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:31,890
<i>- Male witches are the worst kind.</i>
<i>- He's not a witch.</i>

530
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:42,817
That about does it. My work is done.

531
00:56:44,277 --> 00:56:45,653
Okay.

532
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:48,740
That was hot up there.

533
00:56:53,161 --> 00:56:57,832
- Are you a friend of Steven's?
- I'm proud to say that I am.

534
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:02,504
I recently installed his cable
and we just hit it off.

535
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,841
- Are you guys going out a lot?
- Not really.

536
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:10,011
That guy is devoted to you.

537
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:14,307
I shouldn't be telling you this...

538
00:57:15,183 --> 00:57:18,520
...but he thinks
you're the cat's pyjamas.

539
00:57:20,063 --> 00:57:22,107
Did he say that?

540
00:57:23,942 --> 00:57:29,531
Only every five minutes.
Frankly I'm sick of hearing it.

541
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:32,867
- He's a good man.
- Yeah.

542
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:38,540
He mentioned
that you've had some problems.

543
00:57:38,706 --> 00:57:42,961
- It's a little complicated.
- It always is.

544
00:57:43,128 --> 00:57:46,464
I asked a woman to marry me once.

545
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:53,555
She wanted to think about it.
We agreed to take some time apart.

546
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:58,518
You know... Give each other space.

547
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:04,315
She's no longer with us.

548
00:58:06,568 --> 00:58:09,070
I'm sorry.

549
00:58:09,904 --> 00:58:14,159
Sometimes you don't know
what you've got till it's gone.

550
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,667
Promise me you'll never
go bungee jumping in Mexico.

551
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:27,380
- I promise.
- Anyway...

552
00:58:27,547 --> 00:58:30,091
I've said too much.

553
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:35,263
Thank you.

554
00:58:38,016 --> 00:58:41,936
Cherish him, Robin.
Every hair on his head.

555
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:50,111
Excuse me.

556
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,823
- Hello.
<i>- I love you.</i>

557
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,952
Robin? I love you too.

558
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,622
That was so sweet of you.

559
00:59:02,749 --> 00:59:06,753
<i>- You didn't have to do that.</i>
- I-- I wanted to.

560
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,965
Giving me free cable.
Only you would do something like that.

561
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:19,807
I wanted to do something for you,
but you needed space, so...

562
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:24,145
- Let's not make any more rules.
- Okay.

563
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:31,194
<i>- Call me later if you're around.</i>
- Sure, as soon as I get home.

564
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,197
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

565
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:41,037
- Are you ready to rock?
- The concert. Oh, Jesus.

566
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:45,166
I think Robin and I
are getting back together.

567
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:52,006
So you're blowing me off again.
I won't put up with it anymore.

568
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:05,395
- Can't you ask someone else to go?
- Maybe I'll take my cable guy.

569
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:14,028
I'll call you later--

570
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:25,206
Pretty smooth work.
I set them up, you knock them down.

571
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:32,505
- What?
- Robin. I got her back for you.

572
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:37,218
- How do you know about us?
- Free cable's an aphrodisiac.

573
01:00:37,385 --> 01:00:43,516
- Don't mess around with my life.
- I wanted to make things up to you.

574
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:49,188
Do you want to catch a flick?

575
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:58,406
I appreciate
you helping me out with Robin.

576
01:00:58,573 --> 01:01:05,496
Now I'll have to work extra hard
not to screw things up again.

577
01:01:06,414 --> 01:01:13,171
You're a nice guy, but I just
don't have time for a new friend.

578
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:15,089
Okay?

579
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:23,473
- What are you trying to say?
- I don't want to be your friend.

580
01:01:27,143 --> 01:01:32,231
I appreciate your honesty.
You're a straight shooter.

581
01:01:33,274 --> 01:01:38,696
- So you're all right?
- I'm a big boy.

582
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:43,284
It's no big deal. Whatever.

583
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:52,627
- You're sure?
- Uh-huh. I'm fine.

584
01:02:12,146 --> 01:02:15,858
- Robin Harris.
<i>- Hey, it's Chip Douglas.</i>

585
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,988
- Chip Douglas?
<i>- The cable guy.</i>

586
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:29,664
- What's up?
- I'm worried about Steven.

587
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:37,004
<i>- What is it?</i>
- He doesn't seem like himself.

588
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:43,010
- Have you noticed anything?
- No. Things are going really well.

589
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:49,183
Good. That makes me feel better.

590
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:55,231
<i>- Should I be worried?</i>
- No. Maybe I'm being too nervous.

591
01:02:58,317 --> 01:03:00,820
Let's just keep our eyes open.

592
01:03:03,531 --> 01:03:06,492
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye-bye.

593
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:11,581
Stevie, you did it, man.

594
01:03:11,747 --> 01:03:16,377
You put our <i>cajones</i> on the table
and you slam-dunked it.

595
01:03:16,544 --> 01:03:19,839
Way to go. Now they'll probably
give him my job.

596
01:03:20,006 --> 01:03:25,887
- On to the next order of business.
- Steven, I need to talk to you.

597
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:31,851
We have to find an architect.

598
01:03:32,018 --> 01:03:35,855
- I need to talk to you.
- It shall wait.

599
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:42,695
- Is there a Steven Kovacs here?
- Yeah. What's the problem?

600
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:46,908
You're under arrest
for receiving stolen property.

601
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:52,455
- I don't know anything about this.
- Do not speak until spoken to.

602
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:57,585
You have the right to remain silent.

603
01:03:57,752 --> 01:04:02,131
- You have the right to an attorney.
- I didn't accept any stolen goods.

604
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:06,928
<i>Deluxe karaoke machine.</i>
<i>Big-screen TV.</i>

605
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:11,724
<i>Cream his pants...</i>

606
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:20,316
- I can't believe you did this.
- I didn't do anything.

607
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:26,948
He gave you a big-screen TV
and a hi-fi system as a present?

608
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:30,785
- I swear it's true.
- Why would you accept such gifts?

609
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:37,083
- I don't know.
- What's going on? Are you on pot?

610
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,170
I didn't do anything!
Just call my cable guy.

611
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:47,134
Nobody named Chip Douglas
works for the cable company.

612
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:51,806
- This can't be happening.
- It's killing your mother.

613
01:04:51,973 --> 01:04:57,144
- When can you get me out?
- There'll be no bail hearing today.

614
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:00,648
You have to
spend the weekend here.

615
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:03,859
Look at the pretty boy!

616
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:12,368
They call me the pumper.
I'll be your friend.

617
01:05:12,535 --> 01:05:14,579
Lock down!

618
01:05:25,089 --> 01:05:27,091
You hear anything?

619
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:33,556
I came as soon as I could.

620
01:05:33,764 --> 01:05:38,185
- What's your real name?
- Larry Tate. That's not important.

621
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:43,399
We have to get you out of here.
I was watching Court TV.

622
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:48,487
I'll talk to the judge.
I'll put the system on trial.

623
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:53,034
- Why are you doing this to me?
- You did this to you.

624
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:58,706
- You set me up.
- No. I taught you a lesson.

625
01:05:58,873 --> 01:06:03,753
I can be your friend or your enemy.
You seem to prefer the latter.

626
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:06,255
I'm just here to comfort you.

627
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:13,220
Touch it. You need human contact.

628
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:15,222
I will not touch it.

629
01:06:18,225 --> 01:06:22,938
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- I know how you're feeling!

630
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:27,526
- Don't do that.
- I'm here for you!

631
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:33,699
Don't do that! You'll get me killed!

632
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:37,578
Oh, Billy.

633
01:06:44,877 --> 01:06:47,004
I'm just messing with you.

634
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,176
Remember <i>Midnight Express</i>?
Oliver Stone won an Academy Award.

635
01:06:52,343 --> 01:06:54,679
Awesome scene.

636
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:58,891
This is the man who framed me.

637
01:06:59,058 --> 01:07:02,937
Hey, Bernie,
how's that sports package?

638
01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:13,072
Don't worry about Robin.
I'll take care of her.

639
01:07:13,864 --> 01:07:19,453
- If you go near her, I'll kill you.
- That's it. Let's go!

640
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:27,795
This concludes our broadcast day.
Click.

641
01:07:27,962 --> 01:07:32,049
- You've been blowing me off.
- This guy's doing a number on me.

642
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:35,886
- I told you to stay away from him.
- You said I could get free cable.

643
01:07:36,053 --> 01:07:39,890
Did I tell you
to have a karaoke jam with him?

644
01:07:40,057 --> 01:07:43,602
I'm out on bail.

645
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:51,652
I'll see if I can track him down.
What was his name?

646
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:56,907
Larry Tate. But at first he said
his name was Chip Douglas.

647
01:07:57,074 --> 01:08:01,162
Chip Douglas? That sounds familiar.

648
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:04,999
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

649
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:09,587
- You're not fine.
- I just want to get this over with.

650
01:08:09,754 --> 01:08:12,298
I hate visiting my parents.

651
01:08:14,008 --> 01:08:19,930
Is this guy cool?
Just joking. Come in, you psycho.

652
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:25,519
- What is he doing here?
- I invited him.

653
01:08:25,686 --> 01:08:28,814
- I invited him at lunch.
- At lunch?

654
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:33,527
- You look great.
- And you are a vision.

655
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:39,200
- You look rested.
- Come here.

656
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:45,623
- What's wrong? You seem weird.
- You had me sent to jail.

657
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:50,878
- I should take you to the police.
- You can if you like.

658
01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:54,840
But I'd hate
to have to show Robin this.

659
01:08:55,382 --> 01:09:00,721
- Bastard!
- Let's just have a good time.

660
01:09:02,681 --> 01:09:08,729
Steven is carrying his battle axe
and chasing me.

661
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:13,484
So I say, "Hey, it's just a show!
What are you trying to prove?"

662
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:21,992
- He takes things too seriously.
- The guy almost took my head off.

663
01:09:27,748 --> 01:09:32,753
You never played Porno Password?
It's the adult version of the show.

664
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,591
Robin, you're on my team.
Steven, you're with Mom.

665
01:09:38,342 --> 01:09:40,427
You're the judges.

666
01:09:40,594 --> 01:09:43,264
Pick a word.

667
01:09:53,566 --> 01:09:57,278
The password is...

668
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,947
...vagina.

669
01:10:00,531 --> 01:10:04,577
- I really don't want to play.
- Come on, Steven.

670
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,456
Woman.

671
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:14,128
- Woman.
- Man?

672
01:10:18,507 --> 01:10:20,634
Penis.

673
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:26,140
Penis.

674
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,271
- Penis.
- Vagina?

675
01:10:32,438 --> 01:10:34,648
Yes! Yes!

676
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:38,819
She got vagina!

677
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:44,325
- I would have said "schlong."
- Now we're starting to get this!

678
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:56,712
The password is...

679
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:00,674
...nipple.

680
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:05,179
- Can I pass?
- Don't be a stick in the mud.

681
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:09,350
Breast.

682
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:12,728
Breast.

683
01:11:13,854 --> 01:11:15,522
Tit?

684
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:23,364
Remember his clue.

685
01:11:24,114 --> 01:11:27,159
Hard.

686
01:11:29,954 --> 01:11:34,875
- Erection?
- No. But thanks for noticing.

687
01:11:37,211 --> 01:11:41,340
- Your turn!
- Centre.

688
01:11:43,968 --> 01:11:46,053
Centre.

689
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:51,225
- Centre!
- Nipple?

690
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,645
- She got it!
- Mom.

691
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:05,280
The password is...

692
01:12:06,115 --> 01:12:08,826
I'm not sure how to say this.

693
01:12:10,494 --> 01:12:13,038
That little thing...

694
01:12:13,747 --> 01:12:18,085
- No. I can't say that to my mother.
- She can handle it.

695
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:21,714
I won't do it. I've had enough!

696
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:27,594
- It's just skin, Steven.
- I don't want to do it anymore!

697
01:12:27,761 --> 01:12:32,766
- You're overreacting.
- No! He's fooling you all.

698
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:39,440
- He's a lunatic and a felon.
- Everybody just relax.

699
01:12:40,107 --> 01:12:44,737
- We knew this would happen.
- Nothing is happening!

700
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:49,783
This is a safe place.
You're with people who love you.

701
01:12:49,950 --> 01:12:54,913
- We love you.
- I hate you! Get out of my life!

702
01:12:55,080 --> 01:13:00,294
- He's angry with me. I should go.
- No.

703
01:13:00,461 --> 01:13:04,882
- You are being an asshole.
- Do you see what's happening?

704
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:08,969
- You're hitting bottom.
- Stay away.

705
01:13:09,178 --> 01:13:14,183
This is where the healing begins.
Come on.

706
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:20,814
Robin showed me her birthmark.
It's very sexy.

707
01:13:26,153 --> 01:13:29,448
What the hell is wrong with you?

708
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:36,830
Thanks for the delightful evening.
I guess I'll be leaving now.

709
01:13:44,838 --> 01:13:50,844
I forgive you. I only hope
my neurologist will feel the same.

710
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:05,734
- Did anybody notice I'm late?
- You've been here for an hour.

711
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:22,793
<i>- How's Hal?</i>
<i>- The man has no vision.</i>

712
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:29,383
<i>It's like working for Mr. Magoo.</i>
<i>If only someone would dump him.</i>

713
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,387
<i>And those hair plugs...</i>

714
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:37,975
<i>- Hair plugs. Hair plugs...</i>
- Oh, shit.

715
01:14:38,142 --> 01:14:43,772
<i>He's so pathetic.</i>
<i>I think I hate him. Hate him...</i>

716
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:56,034
<i>If only someone would dump him.</i>

717
01:15:03,417 --> 01:15:07,004
I... I don't hate you.

718
01:15:07,171 --> 01:15:10,007
<i>- Those hair plugs.</i>
- Get out.

719
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:41,538
Chip! Chip.

720
01:15:42,748 --> 01:15:45,000
This isn't funny!

721
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,421
Where are you?

722
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:58,222
If you build it, he will come.

723
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:18,325
- Hello?
- Bingo! <i>My Three Sons.</i>

724
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:24,331
- Chip and Ernie Douglas.
- I have a list of ex-cable men.

725
01:16:24,498 --> 01:16:26,667
Murray Slaughter.

726
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:29,586
<i>George Jetson. Jean-Luc Picard.</i>

727
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:34,466
- Someone called The Big Ragoo.
- Carmine, from <i>Laverne & Shirley</i>.

728
01:16:34,633 --> 01:16:36,843
<i>That's so sad that you know that.</i>

729
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:40,430
<i>Anyway, the cable company in town</i>
<i>fired a guy six months ago...</i>

730
01:16:40,597 --> 01:16:42,391
<i>...named Darrin Stephens.</i>

731
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:48,855
His boss was Larry Tate,
from a show called <i>Bewitched</i>.

732
01:16:49,022 --> 01:16:53,610
- He's not with the cable company?
- Yahtzee!

733
01:16:54,861 --> 01:17:01,868
<i>They fired him for stalking customers.</i>
<i>You better lock up tight.</i>

734
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:07,541
<i>In the Sam Sweet Trial,</i>
<i>the jury is close to a verdict.</i>

735
01:17:07,708 --> 01:17:12,963
<i>They will continue deliberating</i>
<i>into the evening hours.</i>

736
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:18,468
<i>The day started real nice,</i>
<i>but now the moisture is increasing.</i>

737
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:22,055
<i>We see thunderstorms...</i>

738
01:17:27,644 --> 01:17:29,396
Cable guy!

739
01:17:32,232 --> 01:17:34,359
Cable guy!

740
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:43,910
Cable guy!

741
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:57,424
Cable guy!

742
01:18:19,863 --> 01:18:23,867
Okay, I'm going!

743
01:18:26,787 --> 01:18:30,540
See you! Bye.

744
01:18:46,223 --> 01:18:51,853
I just want to hang out! No big deal!

745
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,963
- Hello?
- We could have been blood brothers.

746
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:22,968
<i>But you're too needy.</i>
<i>It's a real turn-off. Ask Robin.</i>

747
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:26,763
The cable company fired you.

748
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:30,475
Hold on. I have call waiting.

749
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:48,869
- I know it's you.
- Sorry. Where was I?

750
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:52,289
- Can't we work this out?
<i>- I wish we could.</i>

751
01:19:52,456 --> 01:19:59,463
- I'm just so tired, Steven.
- Where are you?

752
01:19:59,629 --> 01:20:06,636
I'd love to chat, but I'm
getting together with a lady friend.

753
01:20:07,721 --> 01:20:10,015
- You might know her.
- Stay away from her!

754
01:20:10,182 --> 01:20:13,143
<i>Goodbye, Steven. Click.</i>

755
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:20,484
Robin!

756
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:26,573
- Robin!
- She just left with the cable guy!

757
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:29,242
Where were they going?

758
01:20:29,409 --> 01:20:35,165
I heard him say they were taking
a ride on the information highway.

759
01:20:40,587 --> 01:20:43,590
The future is now!

760
01:20:44,549 --> 01:20:49,554
Soon every home will integrate their
television, phone and computer!

761
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:55,602
You'll be able to visit the Louvre,
or watch female mud wrestling.

762
01:20:55,769 --> 01:21:02,526
You can shop from your home, or play
video games with someone in Vietnam.

763
01:21:07,572 --> 01:21:10,909
I want to go home now.
I'm worried about Steven.

764
01:21:11,243 --> 01:21:14,955
Steven. Steven.

765
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:17,123
Steven, Steven, Steven.

766
01:21:37,894 --> 01:21:41,147
- Help!
- Robin!

767
01:21:43,233 --> 01:21:45,902
Where are you?

768
01:21:46,069 --> 01:21:50,198
- Steven!
- I'm coming!

769
01:21:56,454 --> 01:21:59,666
- Help me!
- Hang on!

770
01:22:09,676 --> 01:22:15,473
- Steven, look out!
- Yes, Steven! Look out!

771
01:22:27,027 --> 01:22:33,617
"Dry land is not a myth!"
Kevin Costner, <i>Waterworld</i>.

772
01:22:33,783 --> 01:22:39,748
- Leave him alone!
- I saw that movie six times!

773
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:45,670
Isn't it funny
that we ended up like this?

774
01:22:53,762 --> 01:22:58,058
You'll have to do
better than that, Steven.

775
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:01,728
Steven? Steven.

776
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:05,565
My lisp is gone!

777
01:23:08,193 --> 01:23:11,363
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

778
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:18,995
- Stop it! Steven!
- I'm coming!

779
01:23:28,505 --> 01:23:33,885
The trouble with real life is,
there's no danger music.

780
01:23:45,939 --> 01:23:48,858
Nice jump, Spiderman!

781
01:23:49,025 --> 01:23:50,735
Oh, God.

782
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:59,077
Steven called the fuzz!

783
01:23:59,244 --> 01:24:02,956
Bad boys,
what you gonna do?

784
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:08,044
Skooch over just a tad.

785
01:24:16,302 --> 01:24:19,848
- Here comes our hero.
- Okay. Easy.

786
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:23,727
- It didn't have to be this way.
- What are you planning to do?

787
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:27,647
I don't really have a plan.

788
01:24:27,814 --> 01:24:31,443
I'm going moment to moment now.

789
01:24:31,609 --> 01:24:35,405
You have to admit,
it's a cool place for an ending.

790
01:24:35,572 --> 01:24:38,825
- An ending to what?
- It's like <i>GoldenEye</i>.

791
01:24:38,992 --> 01:24:45,373
This isn't a movie! This is reality!

792
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:50,086
This is the police. You're
trespassing in a restricted area.

793
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,888
I just wanted to be your friend...

794
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,683
...but I screwed it up.

795
01:25:05,393 --> 01:25:11,608
- You are in a high-voltage area.
- What's that?

796
01:25:13,193 --> 01:25:15,195
Come again?

797
01:25:18,031 --> 01:25:24,454
You want me to quiet down
and chill out in front of the TV?

798
01:25:27,999 --> 01:25:31,336
You were never there for me,
were you, Mother?

799
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:39,219
You expected Mike and Carol Brady
to raise me.

800
01:25:39,427 --> 01:25:43,473
I'm the bastard son
of Clair Huxtable!

801
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:47,393
I'm the lost Cunningham!

802
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:54,234
I learned the facts of life
from watching <i>The Facts of Life!</i>

803
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:56,986
Oh, God!

804
01:26:05,203 --> 01:26:07,121
That's it.

805
01:26:11,709 --> 01:26:14,587
That's what I have to do!

806
01:26:16,089 --> 01:26:19,843
No. Don't do that!

807
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:24,597
- Let's go out and have a Heineken.
- Yeah!

808
01:26:24,764 --> 01:26:27,308
I'm not thirsty anymore.

809
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:30,186
See you.

810
01:26:30,645 --> 01:26:32,438
No!

811
01:26:39,696 --> 01:26:42,282
You're not going anywhere!

812
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:48,288
It's okay!
I understand my purpose now!

813
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:52,709
Don't do this. You just need help.
We all get lonely.

814
01:26:52,876 --> 01:26:58,965
But I get really lonely. Look at me!

815
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:06,681
I'll be your pal. Just come on up!

816
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:10,727
No. It's too late for me.

817
01:27:10,894 --> 01:27:16,482
But there are a lot of cable boys
and girls who still have a chance!

818
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:20,486
Don't you understand, Steven?

819
01:27:28,411 --> 01:27:33,333
Somebody has to kill the babysitter.

820
01:27:43,885 --> 01:27:48,056
<i>This is the moment we've been</i>
<i>waiting for. The jury is ready...</i>

821
01:27:48,222 --> 01:27:51,434
<i>The jury has notified the judge</i>
<i>that they've reached a verdict.</i>

822
01:27:51,601 --> 01:27:56,064
<i>We are live.</i>
<i>The jury is seated and the verdict...</i>

823
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:11,788
<i>- The moment of truth...</i>
<i>- Jacob Sweet has been found...</i>

824
01:28:28,721 --> 01:28:30,974
Help. Help.

825
01:28:35,228 --> 01:28:38,189
Preferred customer, my ass!

826
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:28,072
Squad 51. Man down.
Possible back injury.

827
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,747
We'll need an IV with D-5-W.

828
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:39,417
Check vital signs.

829
01:29:40,626 --> 01:29:43,796
Prepare to defibrillate! Clear!

830
01:29:53,473 --> 01:29:54,891
Wait!

831
01:30:01,898 --> 01:30:04,984
You two will be just fine.

832
01:30:05,193 --> 01:30:09,363
Take care of him, Robin.
He's good people.

833
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:12,825
You never told me your real name.

834
01:30:14,077 --> 01:30:17,997
You still want to know my name?

835
01:30:18,915 --> 01:30:20,083
Yeah.

836
01:30:22,752 --> 01:30:26,714
It's Ricardo.

837
01:30:28,508 --> 01:30:31,177
Ricky Ricardo.

838
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:44,774
I'm just messing with you.

839
01:31:06,045 --> 01:31:08,214
Let's go home.

840
01:31:15,012 --> 01:31:19,892
Hang in there, pal!
You're going to make it, buddy!

841
01:31:29,402 --> 01:31:30,403
Hey.

842
01:31:37,326 --> 01:31:43,082
- Am I really your buddy?
- Yeah, sure you are!
