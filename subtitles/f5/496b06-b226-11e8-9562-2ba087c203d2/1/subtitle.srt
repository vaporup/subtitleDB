823
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,536
My associates can escort you
to my chopper...

824
01:01:27,627 --> 01:01:29,265
<i>to take you to Santa Cruz.</i>

825
01:01:29,347 --> 01:01:32,305
<i>I have a jet there.</i>
<i>You'll be in Miami in five hours.</i>

826
01:01:32,387 --> 01:01:35,265
You'II be back here tomorrow
in time for Iunch.

827
01:01:36,787 --> 01:01:37,822
Good.

828
01:01:41,507 --> 01:01:43,065
Good taIking to you.

829
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:46,103
Why not Ieave your friend here?

830
01:01:46,187 --> 01:01:48,860
WhiIe you're gone, he can teII me
how to run my business.

831
01:01:48,947 --> 01:01:51,905
-I think Frank wants to see him.
-No, that's okay.

832
01:01:51,987 --> 01:01:55,502
You teII Frank I'm keeping this guy
on ice for him.

833
01:01:58,147 --> 01:01:59,626
I guess so.

834
01:02:02,747 --> 01:02:04,499
Let's finish our Iunch.

835
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:10,943
I have to hand it to you, Mr. Sosa.

836
01:02:12,267 --> 01:02:14,417
You got everything a man couId want.

837
01:02:16,307 --> 01:02:18,980
I Iike you, Tony.
There is no Iying in you.

838
01:02:20,507 --> 01:02:24,500
UnfortunateIy, I don't feeI the same
about the rest of your organisation.

839
01:02:27,907 --> 01:02:30,057
What do you mean by that, Mr. Sosa?

840
01:02:30,707 --> 01:02:33,016
I'm taIking about Omar Suarez.

841
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,983
This garbage was recognised
by my associate at Iunch...

842
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:42,182
<i>from several years ago in New York.</i>

843
01:02:46,307 --> 01:02:48,343
He was an informer for the poIice.

844
01:02:53,427 --> 01:02:56,897
[Dramatic instrumentaI music]

845
01:02:59,987 --> 01:03:01,261
[Omar screams]

846
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:09,540
SOSA: He put Vito DuvaI and NeIIo
and Gino Ramos away for Iife.

847
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:16,706
<i>So how do I know</i>
<i>you're not a</i> chivato<i>, too, Tony?</i>

848
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,617
Let's get this straight now.

849
01:03:27,267 --> 01:03:31,260
I've never f$cked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

850
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:32,826
You got that?

851
01:03:33,747 --> 01:03:37,376
AII I have in this worId
is my baIIs and my word.

852
01:03:37,507 --> 01:03:40,738
I don't break them for no one,
you understand?

853
01:03:41,827 --> 01:03:44,341
That piece of shit up there,
I never Iiked him...

854
01:03:44,427 --> 01:03:45,860
I never trusted him.

855
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:47,978
For aII I know, he had me set up...

856
01:03:48,067 --> 01:03:50,342
and had my friend
AngeI Fernandez kiIIed.

857
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:52,736
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

858
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:55,102
You want to go on with me, say it.

859
01:03:55,187 --> 01:03:57,826
You don't, then you make a move.

860
01:04:03,267 --> 01:04:05,827
I think you speak from the heart,
Montana.

861
01:04:05,907 --> 01:04:07,260
<i>But I say to myself...</i>

862
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,218
this Lopez, your boss...

863
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:13,980
he had <i>chivatos</i> Iike that
working for him.

864
01:04:14,867 --> 01:04:16,425
His judgment stinks.

865
01:04:18,827 --> 01:04:20,738
So I think to myseIf...

866
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:24,025
how many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

867
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:30,135
How can I trust his organisation?
You teII me, Tony.

868
01:04:32,387 --> 01:04:35,140
Frank is smart, you know?

869
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,657
You can't bIame him for that animaI.

870
01:04:40,827 --> 01:04:43,500
It's a crazy business we're in,
you know?

871
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:46,226
That couId happen to anyone,
even you.

872
01:04:52,427 --> 01:04:55,180
Why don't I go back
and taIk to Frank...

873
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:57,540
and work it out?

874
01:04:58,387 --> 01:05:00,264
I'II fix things between us.

875
01:05:02,107 --> 01:05:03,665
You got my word on that.

876
01:05:05,227 --> 01:05:07,980
I think you and me,
we can work this thing out...

877
01:05:08,587 --> 01:05:10,896
we do business together
for a Iong time.

878
01:05:12,827 --> 01:05:14,101
Just remember...

879
01:05:15,067 --> 01:05:17,137
I'II onIy teII you one time...

880
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,178
don't f$ck me, Tony.

881
01:05:22,707 --> 01:05:24,618
Don't you ever try to f$ck me.

882
01:05:37,907 --> 01:05:39,135
FRANK: You what?

883
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:44,623
You made a deaI
for f$cking $18 miIIion...

884
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:45,981
without even checking with me?

885
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,058
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

886
01:05:48,147 --> 01:05:49,865
-<i>Coño</i>. Take it easy.
-<i>Coño</i>, my ass!

887
01:05:49,947 --> 01:05:52,939
At $10,500 a key. It's <i>puro</i>.

888
01:05:54,427 --> 01:05:56,657
You can't Iose money. No way.

889
01:05:58,587 --> 01:06:01,943
We make $75 miIIion on this deaI.

890
01:06:02,787 --> 01:06:04,857
$75 miIIion.

891
01:06:06,027 --> 01:06:07,779
That is serious money.

892
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:09,819
What is Sosa going to do...

893
01:06:09,907 --> 01:06:12,102
when I don't come up
with the first $5 miIIion?

894
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:14,860
What is he going to do?
WiII he send me a biII?

895
01:06:14,947 --> 01:06:18,257
He'II send a hit squad up here!
There'II be a war in the street.

896
01:06:18,347 --> 01:06:21,942
ReIax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

897
01:06:23,707 --> 01:06:26,699
You short a coupIe of miIIion,
I go on the street for you.

898
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:28,664
I make a coupIe of moves...

899
01:06:29,347 --> 01:06:31,622
a miIIion here, a miIIion there,
you got it.

900
01:06:37,147 --> 01:06:39,377
You've been making moves
on your own?

901
01:06:41,507 --> 01:06:44,385
I got ears, you know? I hear things.

902
01:06:47,987 --> 01:06:50,865
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

903
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:53,063
<i>What about Gomez?</i>

904
01:06:53,147 --> 01:06:55,377
<i>What'll he do</i>
<i>when you start moving 2,000 keys--</i>

905
01:06:55,467 --> 01:06:59,221
F$ck Gaspar Gomez
and f$ck the Diaz brothers!

906
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,456
<i>F$ck 'em all!</i>

907
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:03,457
I'II bury those cockroaches!

908
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:06,665
What they ever do for us?

909
01:07:14,147 --> 01:07:17,025
Look, Frank, the time has come.

910
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:20,059
We gotta expand.

911
01:07:20,827 --> 01:07:23,580
The whoIe operation. Distribution.

912
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:27,739
New York, Chicago, LA.

913
01:07:29,427 --> 01:07:32,100
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

914
01:07:32,947 --> 01:07:34,539
We gotta think big now.

915
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:40,221
Think big.

916
01:07:45,987 --> 01:07:47,625
<i>Like your friend Sosa.</i>

917
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:53,138
Let me teII you something
about that greasebaII cocksucker.

918
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,135
He is a snake, that's what he is.

919
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,695
<i>You turn your back on him,</i>
<i>he'll stick it in.</i>

920
01:08:02,507 --> 01:08:04,498
<i>You don't trust a guy like that.</i>

921
01:08:05,947 --> 01:08:08,097
You want me to beIieve...

922
01:08:08,787 --> 01:08:12,700
Omar was a stooIie
because Sosa said so?

923
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:14,666
You bought that Iine?

924
01:08:15,907 --> 01:08:18,626
<i>Maybe I made a mistake</i>
<i>sending you down there.</i>

925
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:22,905
Maybe you and Sosa
know something I don't know.

926
01:08:26,107 --> 01:08:27,222
Like what?

927
01:08:28,387 --> 01:08:29,740
Like what?

928
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:33,343
You teII me, ''Like what.''

929
01:08:37,387 --> 01:08:39,821
You caIIing me a Iiar, Frank?

930
01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:42,499
That what you're caIIing me?

931
01:08:48,267 --> 01:08:51,862
Let's just say I want things
to stay the way they are for now.

932
01:08:55,067 --> 01:08:57,535
You staII your deaI with Sosa.

933
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:00,415
StaII it?

934
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,106
Okay, boss.

935
01:09:06,747 --> 01:09:07,736
Come on.

936
01:09:10,147 --> 01:09:11,296
I am the boss.

937
01:09:12,627 --> 01:09:14,936
TONY: Sure, you're the boss.
FRANK: Hey, Tony.

938
01:09:19,147 --> 01:09:21,615
Remember I toId you
when you started...

939
01:09:21,787 --> 01:09:24,176
the guys who Iast
in this business...

940
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,143
are the guys who fIy straight...

941
01:09:28,387 --> 01:09:29,820
<i>low-key, quiet.</i>

942
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:33,023
<i>And the guys who want it all...</i>

943
01:09:33,707 --> 01:09:36,858
<i>chicas</i>, champagne, fIash...

944
01:09:38,747 --> 01:09:40,146
they don't Iast.

945
01:09:41,587 --> 01:09:42,815
You finished?

946
01:09:43,707 --> 01:09:44,856
Can I go now?

947
01:10:06,267 --> 01:10:07,905
TONY: Hi, there.

948
01:10:14,947 --> 01:10:16,505
ELVIRA: You just missed Frank.

949
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:20,616
TONY: Too bad.

950
01:10:22,907 --> 01:10:24,898
OnIy I didn't come to see Frank.

951
01:10:26,387 --> 01:10:29,185
ELVIRA: This is not the time
or the pIace, Tony.

952
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:32,135
ELVIRA: Make an appointment.
TONY: That's okay.

953
01:10:32,227 --> 01:10:35,219
I got something important
I want to taIk to you about.

954
01:10:41,827 --> 01:10:44,295
<i>So why don't we have</i>
<i>a couple of drinks...</i>

955
01:10:44,747 --> 01:10:46,100
<i>act normal...</i>

956
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:50,019
<i>and just take it easy.</i>

957
01:10:50,827 --> 01:10:52,658
<i>Come on. I like Scotch.</i>

958
01:10:57,347 --> 01:11:00,498
-Sure. Why not?
-Okay. I won't bite you.

959
01:11:03,027 --> 01:11:04,938
We're aII normaI here.

960
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:12,096
I heard you and Frank
aren't working together anymore.

961
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:13,741
That's right.

962
01:11:18,147 --> 01:11:20,297
I think it's easier, don't you?

963
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,665
Makes things easier.

964
01:11:25,107 --> 01:11:26,176
Thank you.

965
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,503
Here's to ''the Iand of opportunity.''

966
01:11:30,507 --> 01:11:31,906
ELVIRA: For you, maybe.

967
01:11:36,787 --> 01:11:37,936
You Iike kids?

968
01:11:39,747 --> 01:11:40,736
Kids?

969
01:11:41,347 --> 01:11:43,497
Kids. You know, kids. LittIe kids.

970
01:11:45,187 --> 01:11:47,223
Sure. Why not?

971
01:11:47,587 --> 01:11:49,020
As Iong as there's a nurse.

972
01:11:49,107 --> 01:11:51,940
Good, 'cause I Iike kids, too.

973
01:11:53,827 --> 01:11:57,786
I Iike them. Boys, girIs.
Don't matter to me.

974
01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:02,983
Frank's gonna be back any minute.

975
01:12:03,507 --> 01:12:04,906
Come here.

976
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:12,656
Sit here.

977
01:12:13,507 --> 01:12:16,658
<i>I want to talk to you. Sit down.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna bite you.</i>

978
01:12:22,387 --> 01:12:24,105
Okay, here's the story.

979
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:30,304
I come from the gutter. I know that.

980
01:12:32,587 --> 01:12:34,179
I got no education...

981
01:12:35,027 --> 01:12:36,506
but that's okay.

982
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:39,823
I know the street...

983
01:12:39,907 --> 01:12:42,296
and I'm making
aII the right connections.

984
01:12:43,387 --> 01:12:46,777
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

985
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:49,538
I couId go right to the top.

986
01:12:51,587 --> 01:12:52,622
Anyway...

987
01:12:53,467 --> 01:12:55,537
what I got to teII you is this:

988
01:12:57,627 --> 01:12:59,106
I Iike you.

989
01:13:02,267 --> 01:13:04,940
I Iiked you
the first time I Iaid eyes on you.

990
01:13:08,027 --> 01:13:10,495
I said, ''She's a tiger.

991
01:13:12,827 --> 01:13:14,704
''She'II beIong to me.''

992
01:13:18,547 --> 01:13:19,900
Anyway...
