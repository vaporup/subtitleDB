1
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,801
What's the meaning of this check?

2
00:01:34,938 --> 00:01:35,632
You trying to get me to cheat?

3
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,103
No...

4
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,207
I'm just the middleman.

5
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,400
You trying to play fast and loose
with me, or get me in trouble?

6
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:43,035
Do you think you're going
to get ahead of me...

7
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,477
...if I take a fall?

8
00:01:44,614 --> 00:01:46,741
Look at this!

9
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:49,716
I'm the only Golden Leg!

10
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,616
You can't even dream about that.

11
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,620
No... I don't.

12
00:01:53,757 --> 00:01:55,952
I just want a little kick-back.
Please don't tell anybody.

13
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,117
You're trash!

14
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,128
I'm sorry. I'll see you later.

15
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,288
Golden Leg! Golden Leg...

16
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:36,695
Golden Leg...

17
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:44,433
Golden Leg...

18
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:36,718
Hung, you've been a star player
for twenty years.

19
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,420
Since Fung missed the penalty kick
and lost his golden leg,

20
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:41,359
you've never have any rivals.
Now how do you feel about...

21
00:03:41,498 --> 00:03:43,193
Oh, no! Don't talk to
me about that!

22
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,322
Hung, your Evil Team

23
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,934
has already won the gold
for five straight years.

24
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:47,229
What's the secret?

25
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,066
Secret? The secret is having
the greatest coach in soccer.

26
00:03:50,206 --> 00:03:51,901
So you're confident
you'll win the gold again?

27
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:55,136
What are you, a rookie reporter? I don't
think that question even needs asking.

28
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:59,340
Excuse me...

29
00:03:59,816 --> 00:04:02,046
Good morning, Hung!

30
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:04,947
Golden Leg!

31
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,015
Good morning, Hung!

32
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,387
Good morning!

33
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:12,791
Hung, your shoe is dirty.

34
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:14,226
I'll help you clean it up.

35
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:16,525
It's fine. I can take care of it.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,501
Hung, I'll take your car over.

37
00:04:25,642 --> 00:04:28,975
Hung, you promised to offer
a coaching job to me.

38
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,046
I'm ready.

39
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:34,241
I've got the confidence to train
a team as good as the Evil Team.

40
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,378
Do you think you can
still be a coach?

41
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,645
Forget it.

42
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:39,084
But you said...

43
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:43,522
Get real.

44
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,424
Don't you see?
You're a cripple now.

45
00:04:47,197 --> 00:04:50,098
Do you think you can
still depend on this tattoo?

46
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:51,564
Hung...

47
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:52,827
I've served you for twenty years.

48
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,436
How can you say something like that?

49
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:57,904
I'm not in the mood for this today.
Things change.

50
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,770
You looked great when you were young.

51
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:03,037
You see, now you just look like a dog.

52
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,703
Forget it. Get lost.

53
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:06,816
I've already taken care
of you for twenty years.

54
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,544
You know, that's a lot of money.

55
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,244
Hung!

56
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:13,422
You're so vain!

57
00:05:13,556 --> 00:05:15,751
If you hadn't given me...

58
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,190
...that bribery payoff twenty years ago,

59
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:20,228
I wouldn't be crippled now.

60
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,695
What? Are you losing your temper?
Why don't you shout louder?

61
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:24,493
Hey! Did all you guys hear that?

62
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:27,728
There're thousands of reporters outside.
Would you like me to let them come in?

63
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,328
You know,

64
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,373
I kept you here to keep your mouth shut.

65
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,999
But do you think anyone would believe...

66
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:35,236
...a handicapped beggar like you now?

67
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,369
- You!
- Don't be angry.

68
00:05:37,514 --> 00:05:40,074
If you want to blame somebody,
blame yourself.

69
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:42,442
You should blame your greediness.

70
00:05:42,585 --> 00:05:44,314
Forget it.

71
00:05:46,923 --> 00:05:48,891
I'll tell you one more thing.

72
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:52,893
I was the one who arranged
that "accident" with your leg.

73
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:28,364
Damn it!

74
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:44,907
That's no way to kick.

75
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,293
Pardon?

76
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,792
I said...

77
00:07:06,603 --> 00:07:08,696
...that's no way to kick.

78
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:14,466
So how would you do it then?

79
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:19,048
There has to be a fusion of
strength from the waist to the foot.

80
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:23,277
What do you mean?

81
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:41,166
My idol, Bruce Lee,

82
00:07:41,304 --> 00:07:45,400
has already elaborated on it.

83
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,975
If you want to learn more,

84
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,340
you can take two
Kung Fu lessons from me.

85
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,538
Learn Kung Fu from you?

86
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,673
You just look like a cleaner.

87
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:57,378
Cleaning is just my job.

88
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,353
I'm really a post-graduate student.

89
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,117
Post-graduate student?

90
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,283
Focusing on how to

91
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:08,090
effectively teach Shaolin Kung Fu.

92
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,061
This is my name card.

93
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:16,635
Shaolin Orthodox School
Mighty Steel Leg.

94
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,365
Look! It's really strong.

95
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:23,144
Fighting is not my style.

96
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,905
I'm a well-educated man.

97
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,709
You're wrong.

98
00:08:29,886 --> 00:08:31,251
Look at that girl.

99
00:08:33,923 --> 00:08:35,857
I know she's sexy, so what?

100
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:37,960
- I'm an educated...
- No...

101
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,858
Watch this!

102
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:56,705
If she had learned Shaolin Kung Fu,
Weight Vest,

103
00:08:56,846 --> 00:08:58,473
she would not have fallen like that.

104
00:08:58,615 --> 00:08:59,775
You see!

105
00:09:07,557 --> 00:09:10,492
So Shaolin Kung Fu is great!

106
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:13,859
Hey! Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

107
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,828
You're crazy!

108
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:19,465
Look at the woman over there.

109
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,429
If she had studied Shaolin Kung Fu,
Iron Hand,

110
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,631
parking would be much easier.

111
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:31,871
So Kung Fu is wonderful!

112
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,380
Excuse me! Do you want to learn...

113
00:09:33,516 --> 00:09:35,575
No... Here, get lost!

114
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:38,948
This coin isn't just yours.
I should get a share.

115
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:40,919
Don't try to ruin our relationship!

116
00:09:41,057 --> 00:09:42,524
Look at that!

117
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,559
What's wrong?

118
00:09:44,694 --> 00:09:46,321
You've already spent a whole week
trying to trim this tree.

119
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,861
You're fired. Get lost!

120
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,124
- I'm sorry...
- Go away!

121
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,030
If he had studied Shaolin Kung Fu,
Nine Fences of the Recluse,

122
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:54,602
he would not be in trouble!

123
00:09:56,973 --> 00:10:00,170
Nine Fences of the Recluse
sounds like it came from Hua Shan.

124
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,710
Don't you know every kind of Kung Fu
originally came from Shaolin?

125
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,266
Kung Fu is absolutely great
for people of all ages.

126
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,962
Brutality is just the wrong
impression of Kung Fu.

127
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:30,936
Kung Fu is an art,

128
00:10:31,074 --> 00:10:32,871
a kind of indomitable spirit.

129
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:34,636
I'm looking for a good method...

130
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,041
...to package Shaolin Kung Fu...

131
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,647
...to help people understand...

132
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:41,181
...the true meaning of it.

133
00:10:41,317 --> 00:10:42,341
Enough, already!

134
00:10:42,485 --> 00:10:43,747
I'm not finished yet.

135
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:45,410
You're already finished.

136
00:10:45,555 --> 00:10:46,886
I still have to make an appointment
with you as my client.

137
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,490
You're done!

138
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,319
Please seize this opportunity!

139
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,223
The lame can also learn Kung Fu.

140
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:55,626
What are you talking about?
Who's lame?

141
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:57,892
You're not qualified
to even talk soccer with me.

142
00:10:58,034 --> 00:10:58,830
I'm sorry!

143
00:10:58,968 --> 00:10:59,832
Yes, I'm lame.

144
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:03,063
It's none of your business.

145
00:11:03,206 --> 00:11:04,434
What? Being lame?

146
00:11:05,842 --> 00:11:07,173
Why you stinking...!

147
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:18,310
What the...?

148
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:19,648
Moron! Did you think
that would scare me?

149
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:23,225
Hey, do you still want the garbage?
If you don't, I'll call the other one.

150
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:24,257
I'm coming over.

151
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,690
Hurry up!

152
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:29,855
Did you think that would
scare me? Huh? Idiot...

153
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,953
Hey, hey, hey, get out of here!

154
00:12:23,753 --> 00:12:25,584
Ah, excuse me! Could you give me a hand
putting this over there?

155
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:27,120
No problem!

156
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,591
Wow! What a leg!

157
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,125
- Twenty cents!
- You're kidding! Just twenty cents?

158
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,737
There are some cups and plates inside.
Won't you give me ten cents more?

159
00:12:42,872 --> 00:12:45,170
No more!

160
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:46,297
Go on, move it over there.

161
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:14,229
Mui, would you please give me
ten steamed bread!

162
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:51,622
Using Tai Chi Kung Fu to make
steamed bread is a striking idea.

163
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:57,228
The steamed bread looks
sweet and tasty.

164
00:14:57,373 --> 00:15:00,274
I'm so impressed...

165
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:07,611
...by her strong arms.

166
00:15:08,117 --> 00:15:09,345
You...

167
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:11,117
What are you doing?

168
00:15:11,253 --> 00:15:13,346
Singing is the perfect way...

169
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:17,323
for me to express
my true feelings about you.

170
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,719
You're so beautiful!

171
00:15:22,565 --> 00:15:25,534
I'm not beautiful. Don't laugh at me!

172
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:27,863
Look at this! This steamed bread is incredible!

173
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,869
Tastes wonderful!

174
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,843
Your Tai Chi Kung Fu, Shifting Bodies
and Transposing Shadows...

175
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:40,244
It's a firm but gentle Kung Fu,
Shove a Thousand Cattle with Four Tales.

176
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,212
So!

177
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:45,921
That's why the steamed bread
is so tender yet firm.

178
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:50,016
They're fifty cents each.
Two steamed bread, that's one dollar.

179
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,987
- That much!
- Yes, that much.

180
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:55,222
It may be expensive,
but it's worth it.

181
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:57,862
I only have fifty cents right now.

182
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,627
Would you mind if I paid
you back two days later?

183
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,633
No...

184
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,967
Well! You're a typical Kung Fu master,
speaking with grace and ease.

185
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,971
You know, we have something in
common. I'm also a Shaolin master.

186
00:16:06,242 --> 00:16:07,402
Would you allow me
a face-saving proposition?

187
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,305
No.

188
00:16:08,444 --> 00:16:09,604
Okay!

189
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,277
This is a pair of precious sneakers.
The original price was two dollars.

190
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:17,478
Now, I'll give you a discount on the price...

191
00:16:17,621 --> 00:16:18,781
One dollar and fifty cents,
and I'll take one more steamed bread.

192
00:16:18,922 --> 00:16:20,617
- I'm going to call the police!
- Okay!

193
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,285
Why won't you give me a break?

194
00:16:24,428 --> 00:16:27,261
Ah, you are so beautiful...

195
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:29,560
Shut up!

196
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,095
Stop singing, please.

197
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,130
Put your money down
and go away right now.

198
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:36,262
If you want to sing,
you ought to go climb up that mountain.

199
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,704
Only a loony would be singing over here.

200
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,473
I don't agree with this girl.

201
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:47,709
It's not crazy for someone to be singing here.

202
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:49,910
This is breaking out.

203
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,610
I've never given up my dream...

204
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:54,986
...of being a composer.

205
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,719
This gentleman's song is...

206
00:16:57,861 --> 00:17:00,796
...so creative and enthusiastic.

207
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:01,863
Thank you!

208
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:03,329
You're welcome.

209
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:07,433
His song has touched me deeply
and draws out my enthusiasm.

210
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:11,232
Right now, I feel like I'm going to...

211
00:17:11,374 --> 00:17:13,001
Explode!

212
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,123
Even though I'm just a butcher,
I also dream of being a dancer.

213
00:17:55,986 --> 00:17:57,146
Do it!

214
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,083
Haven't you got anything
better to do right now?

215
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:41,091
Stand up straight! Put your hands down!
Stop scrunching your neck up!

216
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,830
You're all nuts!

217
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,861
This is no place to be dancing!

218
00:18:48,672 --> 00:18:50,071
Are you out of your mind?

219
00:18:50,206 --> 00:18:51,503
All I do is go out to get a facial.

220
00:18:51,641 --> 00:18:54,940
I can't leave for a minute and you
turn this place upside down!

221
00:18:55,445 --> 00:18:56,776
What are you screwballs doing here?

222
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,143
Why are you so ferocious,
shouting at everybody like that.

223
00:18:59,816 --> 00:19:01,807
I came here to buy steamed bread.

224
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:06,381
Is my steamed bread ready?

225
00:19:06,523 --> 00:19:08,320
Coming! Just a minute!

226
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:10,390
Did that guy pay
for the steamed bread?

227
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:15,730
He did.

228
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:19,127
What's this dirty stuff?
Throw it away!

229
00:19:31,551 --> 00:19:32,882
First Big Brother!

230
00:19:38,992 --> 00:19:42,621
First Big Brother!

231
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:43,660
It's okay!

232
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,459
Keep working. Clean it up, please!

233
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:51,628
Are you sick, First Big Brother?

234
00:19:51,771 --> 00:19:54,501
I've got a headache.
I got drunk last night.

235
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,607
Anyway, what do you want?

236
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:58,336
I wanted to let you know
I've been awakened.

237
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,537
- Really? You've been awakened?
- I've been awakened.

238
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,647
I finally understand.

239
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:04,147
If I want to teach
Shaolin Kung Fu to the world,

240
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:05,410
I need to package it
into a new and modern form.

241
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,476
What kind of packaging?

242
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:10,113
Singing!

243
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:13,254
You won't believe what I saw today.

244
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,384
- I saw a steamed bread shop...
- Stop bothering me!

245
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:18,292
But, what would you think
if I combined Shaolin Kung Fu...

246
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:19,363
...with singing and dancing?

247
00:20:19,499 --> 00:20:20,329
Don't even think about it!

248
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:21,558
How can you dismiss it like that
if you never even try it?

249
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:22,998
Stop thinking about it!

250
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:25,468
I've already told you you need to
make a living in the real world.

251
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,971
There's a vacancy for a toilet cleaner.
It would be good for you...

252
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:29,836
...to take it rather than
to keep living in a dream.

253
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:33,139
If we don't have any dreams in life,
we're no better than salted fish.

254
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,112
Yeah, well look at you, you're a real
salted fish, not even a pair of shoes!

255
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:38,114
How can you talk about dreams?

256
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,548
Now just hold on a minute!

257
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:42,916
The fire in my heart
isn't put out that easily!

258
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,680
Why not? Just blow it out!

259
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,122
But it'll just be lit up again!

260
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,693
Enough, already!

261
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,125
We both have our own lives.

262
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,788
Please don't bother me!

263
00:20:52,932 --> 00:20:54,991
I need to work to support my family.

264
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:57,830
You mean you are willing
to give up your Iron Head?

265
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,530
Are you forgetting how much
effort you put into it?

266
00:21:00,673 --> 00:21:01,970
You're wrong!

267
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:05,408
I've never given it up...

268
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,842
...not even for a day!

269
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,174
Fei!

270
00:21:09,315 --> 00:21:10,373
Boss!

271
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:11,984
Dammit!

272
00:21:12,118 --> 00:21:13,710
The dancers quit the show already.

273
00:21:13,853 --> 00:21:15,548
What are you doing hanging around
here doing nothing about it?

274
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:18,418
I'm not! I have a great idea.

275
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:19,456
What's that?

276
00:21:19,592 --> 00:21:22,686
Uh, combining Shaolin Kung Fu
with singing and dancing.

277
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:23,955
What kind of Shaolin Kung Fu?

278
00:21:24,097 --> 00:21:25,223
Look at this!

279
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:31,234
There's no way that's gonna sell.

280
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,428
He's good enough.

281
00:21:32,572 --> 00:21:34,472
No way! And what about you?

282
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:35,869
Me?

283
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:38,604
Dammit!

284
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,473
What about your Iron Head?

285
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,447
If you don't do a good job,
I'll kill you tomorrow.

286
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,744
OK.

287
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:48,182
First Big Brother, thank you!

288
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:02,097
Shaolin Kung Fu is great!

289
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:04,203
Really great!

290
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:06,498
Shaolin Kung Fu is wonderful!

291
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,698
Wonderful!

292
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,934
I'm Iron Head.

293
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:13,102
Iron Head.

294
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,339
You're Mighty Steel Leg.

295
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,642
I'm Mighty Steel Leg.

296
00:22:22,722 --> 00:22:23,882
Be serious!

297
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,989
Shaolin Kung Fu is great!

298
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,390
Really great!

299
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,428
Shaolin Kung Fu is great!

300
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:38,332
Really great!

301
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,996
Shaolin Kung Fu is wonderful!

302
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:43,005
Wonderful!

303
00:22:43,142 --> 00:22:45,303
I'm Mighty Steel Leg!

304
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:47,173
Mighty Steel Leg!

305
00:22:47,313 --> 00:22:50,009
He's Iron Head!

306
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,816
Ahh, I'm gonna die!

307
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,620
What are you singing about?
You sound like you're howling.

308
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:31,120
The lyrics are pathetic.

309
00:23:31,257 --> 00:23:32,849
I can't understand
a thing you're saying.

310
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,391
That's right. Who wrote this garbage?

311
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,757
- Yeah, who did it?
- Who did it?

312
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,034
Creative work is highly subjective,

313
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:46,104
but I must respond to your criticism.

314
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:48,537
The singing is just
the beginning of the show,

315
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:52,269
the climax is the performance of
Mighty Steel Leg and Iron Head!

316
00:23:52,411 --> 00:23:53,708
Iron Head?

317
00:23:53,946 --> 00:23:55,675
I told you already
that you wrote awful lyrics.

318
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,715
I'm not Iron Head. He's...

319
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,976
Iron Head?

320
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:00,847
- I said...
- Iron Head?

321
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:02,045
Mighty Steel Leg!

322
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:04,247
He's Mighty Steel Leg!

323
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,984
You're still saying
Mighty Steel Leg?

324
00:24:07,426 --> 00:24:08,450
I oughta kill you!

325
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:09,754
Mighty Steel Leg!

326
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,561
I'm the real Mighty Steel Leg!

327
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,800
Iron Head?

328
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:17,492
Don't you understand
Chinese? He's the real...

329
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:18,729
Iron Head?

330
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,133
You're so stubborn!

331
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:21,297
Iron...

332
00:24:21,941 --> 00:24:23,932
Do you want to start a fight?

333
00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:28,644
Thank you so much!

334
00:24:28,781 --> 00:24:31,215
Happy hour is going fast.

335
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,750
It's time for us
to say goodbye right now.

336
00:24:33,886 --> 00:24:36,684
Let's listen to some music!

337
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:39,086
You guys are crazy!

338
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:43,895
Let's see if you can take some more!

339
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,223
Thank you!

340
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:48,683
Why you stinking...!

341
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,225
What on earth?

342
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:53,748
Let's go! There's nothing interesting here!

343
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:59,261
Do you still want to fight with us?

344
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,667
I promised my Shaolin master I wouldn't
use Kung Fu to fight with anyone.

345
00:27:04,804 --> 00:27:07,898
This guy is crazy.

346
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,201
But all you guys should apologize!

347
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:11,640
Apologize?

348
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:14,473
It's not our problem.
This was all your fault!

349
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:35,656
Don't move! You said you wouldn't
use Kung Fu to hit anyone!

350
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:49,178
I didn't come here to fight.
I came to play soccer.

351
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:58,420
That's it, I'm gonna kick your...

352
00:28:03,295 --> 00:28:05,126
Hey, get up, quit goofing around!

353
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,659
What's he...?

354
00:28:42,401 --> 00:28:44,562
Stop, please! I'm so sorry!

355
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:03,748
Do you have any money on you?

356
00:29:04,723 --> 00:29:05,815
Yeah.

357
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,222
Thirty cents.

358
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,085
Hey, are you taking my money?

359
00:29:12,231 --> 00:29:14,358
Yes, I am.
Did you study Tong Long Fist?

360
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,398
I did.

361
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,593
Don't be an embarrassment to
Shaolin Kung Fu anymore!

362
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:48,095
Would you let me

363
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,996
take a look at your leg?

364
00:29:50,536 --> 00:29:54,165
I'm not really in the mood.
But go ahead.

365
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:07,477
Amazing! It's the real thing,
pure Kung Fu.

366
00:30:13,792 --> 00:30:17,159
A great killer slim leg.

367
00:30:17,296 --> 00:30:20,390
It's Shaolin Mighty Steel Leg!

368
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:25,401
Could it be possible to use
Kung Fu to play soccer?

369
00:30:26,939 --> 00:30:28,531
Are you serious?

370
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:30,073
Yes, of course!

371
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,010
That's it!

372
00:30:33,178 --> 00:30:35,806
That's a great idea,
use Kung Fu to play soccer.

373
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,609
Why didn't I ever think of that?

374
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,241
Aren't you that cripple?

375
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:42,183
I'm not just a cripple,

376
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:45,222
I'm the ex-soccer player, Golden Leg.

377
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:46,790
Now, I'm a soccer coach.

378
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:48,654
That's great!
You can teach me how to play soccer.

379
00:30:48,794 --> 00:30:50,091
Now, hold on.

380
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:51,890
No! You told me I could use
Kung Fu to play soccer.

381
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,294
But I need some time to think this over!

382
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:56,196
I don't have time to think anymore!

383
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:59,765
It's afternoon already!

384
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,802
Time doesn't wait for anyone!

385
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:09,211
But we have so much to prepare!

386
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:12,414
I'm ready! What do I need?

387
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:15,643
At least a pair of shoes!

388
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:23,020
Do you have any money
to get your sneakers back?

389
00:31:23,162 --> 00:31:24,595
No. But...

390
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,822
I threw them away.

391
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,090
Threw them away!?!

392
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,827
Your sneakers were broken.
They're well worn.

393
00:31:30,969 --> 00:31:33,563
- Yes, they were broken. But I...
- Go home!

394
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:37,340
My boss will shout at you
if she comes back and sees you.

395
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:41,740
Wait!

396
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:47,278
You can't have the broken ones back.

397
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,410
Those have been fixed.
Do you want to have them?

398
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,242
First Big Brother, what are you doing?

399
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,008
First Big Brother, are you okay?

400
00:32:20,085 --> 00:32:21,677
I'm fine.

401
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:24,848
What do you want?

402
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,048
I finally got a great idea

403
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:28,785
for sharing Shaolin Kung Fu.

404
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:32,596
It's playing soccer!

405
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,766
Please let me go!

406
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:38,597
You've already gotten me into trouble.
I got fired.

407
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:41,399
Now, I have to clean rest rooms
to pay for my boss's loss.

408
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,871
I've come here to help you.

409
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,568
No! Absolutely not!

410
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:46,939
If you bother me anymore,

411
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:49,206
my whole family will commit suicide
in front of you.

412
00:32:49,348 --> 00:32:51,873
Committing suicide isn't a good way
to solve any problems.

413
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:52,949
Be brave!

414
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:54,313
Don't be stupid!

415
00:32:54,453 --> 00:32:56,717
I'm just a loser!

416
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:57,981
Please don't come here anymore!

417
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:00,114
If you still want to form a soccer team,
you can ask the other Brothers.

418
00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:04,127
Please, don't bother me!

419
00:33:04,363 --> 00:33:05,387
I beg you!

420
00:33:05,531 --> 00:33:07,658
Iron Head.

421
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:14,736
Good morning, Fourth Big Brother!

422
00:33:15,107 --> 00:33:16,005
Good morning, Sing!

423
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:17,665
How are you?

424
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,744
Let me introduce a great guy to you! He's...

425
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:27,280
Nice to meet you!

426
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,718
This is Fung.

427
00:33:28,854 --> 00:33:31,618
I know, Fung is famous
in the stock exchange market.

428
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:33,054
You see!
He has that great I.T. Look.

429
00:33:33,192 --> 00:33:34,216
Fung is a soccer coach.

430
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,690
Soccer coach!

431
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:37,352
Of course, everyone knows
that Fung is the most...

432
00:33:37,496 --> 00:33:38,986
...famous figure in the soccer world.

433
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,928
Do you use your legs to play soccer?

434
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:43,466
You see! I'm right.
Actually, do you have any jobs?

435
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:44,933
I want you to join my soccer team.

436
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,367
Play soccer?

437
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,496
I haven't had a job for six months.
How can you ask me to play soccer?

438
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,437
If you can use your Empty Hand...

439
00:33:50,576 --> 00:33:51,600
...to be the goalkeeper...

440
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,769
What's Empty Hand?
That was years ago.

441
00:33:54,913 --> 00:33:56,540
You know,
I even forgot when our Master died.

442
00:33:56,682 --> 00:33:57,910
Please listen to me!

443
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:00,211
We're going to sign up for
the National Soccer Tournament.

444
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:02,320
The prize is one million dollars.

445
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:05,651
Really?
So, I see you're the sharp one.

446
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:08,453
Look at that!
All dressed up and everything.

447
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:11,495
Many years ago, our Master
ordered us to share Shaolin Kung Fu.

448
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,860
Now, you guys get this great idea
of using Shaolin Kung Fu...

449
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:15,057
...to play soccer!?!

450
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,497
Look here!

451
00:34:16,635 --> 00:34:18,262
This is a group picture
of our Master and Brothers.

452
00:34:18,403 --> 00:34:19,529
I always keep it UNDER my pillow.

453
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,660
You should know what I mean.

454
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:22,865
Great! Let's sit down
to talk about what you mean.

455
00:34:24,776 --> 00:34:28,143
I'll call you if I've got time.
Oh, and remember to find a job for me.

456
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,873
I really don't have time to talk to you.

457
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:33,917
Some clients are waiting for me, I need
to keep my eyes on the stock market.

458
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,576
You know, each of my trades are
hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece.

459
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:37,052
Hello! What's the price right now?

460
00:34:37,189 --> 00:34:38,918
My driver is on leave today.

461
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:41,116
And I just loaned my car to my friend,

462
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,285
and I left my wallet in my office.

463
00:34:43,428 --> 00:34:44,656
I'm sorry! I don't have time
to have lunch with you guys.

464
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:45,888
I'm really busy!

465
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:48,431
Go away!

466
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:49,693
Third Big Brother, think about it!

467
00:34:49,835 --> 00:34:51,325
If you can use Iron Shirt...

468
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,767
...to be the back...

469
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:55,738
What's Iron Shirt?

470
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,399
Look around! The sky
is full of planes.

471
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,168
The streets are full of computers.

472
00:35:00,312 --> 00:35:02,439
It's the 21st century.
Stop living in your dream world!

473
00:35:02,581 --> 00:35:05,573
Well, I think it's a good idea,
combining Kung Fu with soccer.

474
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,309
He's right! And the prize
is a huge amount of money.

475
00:35:07,452 --> 00:35:09,181
For heaven's sake! You think I'm...

476
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:10,787
I'm trading hundreds of
thousands of dollars a day.

477
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:13,084
There's absolutely no way I'm giving up
my trading to play soccer with you guys.

478
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,591
I'm sorry for being
so direct, you know...

479
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,821
But it'd be impossible to give up
my trading and sign up to play
soccer with you lame-o's.

480
00:35:18,964 --> 00:35:20,693
Forgive me. I'm just an honest guy.

481
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:23,596
Finally, it's also impossible for me
to win any damn soccer game.

482
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,067
Truly, the probability of winning is 0%.

483
00:35:26,204 --> 00:35:27,228
Probabi...

484
00:35:27,372 --> 00:35:29,932
Probability!

485
00:35:30,075 --> 00:35:32,066
Okay...

486
00:35:32,444 --> 00:35:35,072
See this? It's always heads or tails.

487
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:37,112
You'll never get the middle.

488
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:40,115
So the probability is 0%.

489
00:35:40,252 --> 00:35:40,911
Let me try!

490
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,850
Get lost!

491
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:44,889
I've got an appointment
with my client at the coffee shop.

492
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:46,251
I'm very busy!

493
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:48,791
We could take you out for
noodles at the same shop.

494
00:35:49,194 --> 00:35:51,458
Morons! I'm dealing with
hundreds of thousands of dollars!

495
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,564
How can I go have noodles
with you guys?

496
00:36:12,117 --> 00:36:14,745
He's my Sixth Small Brother, Weight Vest.

497
00:36:14,886 --> 00:36:17,252
This is the famous soccer coach, Fung.

498
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,721
Fung, how are you?

499
00:36:21,426 --> 00:36:22,154
Uh, what Vest?

500
00:36:22,294 --> 00:36:23,591
Weight Vest.

501
00:36:23,729 --> 00:36:25,128
Nice to meet you, Mr. Vest.

502
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:28,489
Fifth Big Brother, are you thinking
about playing soccer?

503
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,327
Yes.

504
00:36:29,468 --> 00:36:32,164
If you can use Shaolin Kung Fu
Weight Vest to be the forward with me,

505
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:34,932
Our attack should be flawless.

506
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,301
- Do you have confidence in this?
- Of course.

507
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:39,535
Great! Are there any
diet pills around here?

508
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:41,644
It's useless.

509
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,216
Since this virus got into my head,
there's no way for me to lose any weight.

510
00:36:45,851 --> 00:36:49,218
Since becoming like this,
I can't even walk quickly,

511
00:36:49,354 --> 00:36:52,846
let alone be able to use
Shaolin Kung Fu Weight Vest.

512
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:56,755
Yeah, you're a little overweight,
but that's not so important.

513
00:36:56,895 --> 00:36:58,226
Forget it!

514
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,791
See, this is a picture
of how I used to look!

515
00:37:03,435 --> 00:37:05,232
Since becoming like this,

516
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:06,860
I can't even get a date with a girl.

517
00:37:07,105 --> 00:37:08,800
You don't understand how it is.

518
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,840
I do. I can't date girls either!

519
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:12,204
Really?

520
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:14,141
Why? Too much gossip about
your girls in newspapers and magazines?

521
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:15,405
What kind of newspapers and magazines?

522
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,708
Oh! I'm sorry!

523
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:21,275
Since I've had this disease,
I can't control myself.

524
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:24,446
I'm sorry. Please leave me alone!

525
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,084
Small Brother!

526
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,587
You should have confidence!
You can do it!

527
00:37:32,097 --> 00:37:33,689
Everyone calls me Lazy Pig now...

528
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:35,732
You know, you're the only one
who calls me Small Brother.

529
00:37:39,504 --> 00:37:40,562
Thank you!

530
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,538
Lazy Pig, help me get that
package of red tissue rolls.

531
00:37:47,913 --> 00:37:49,312
The red one!

532
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,794
Playing soccer?

533
00:38:12,938 --> 00:38:13,962
Yes, Second Big Brother!

534
00:38:14,106 --> 00:38:17,303
If you can use
Hooking Leg to be the back,

535
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:18,431
I believe...

536
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,941
Your defense will be flawless!

537
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:20,840
Absolutely!

538
00:38:20,979 --> 00:38:24,176
So you think I can
still use Hooking Leg?

539
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,645
Sure, you just need some practice.

540
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:29,583
If you trust yourself,
you will get your Hooking Leg back.

541
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:31,052
Really?

542
00:38:31,756 --> 00:38:34,247
I just saw you
cleaning sewers recently.

543
00:38:34,392 --> 00:38:36,724
Why did you get a second
job washing dishes?

544
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,124
Why?

545
00:38:38,396 --> 00:38:40,956
Why are you asking me that?
I don't understand, either.

546
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,693
Why didn't I have a rich father,
Lee Ka Sing?

547
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,266
Why am I going bald,
even though I'm so handsome?

548
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,306
You guys aren't going bald,
but you're so ugly.

549
00:38:50,442 --> 00:38:52,273
Why did the other guys get to
go to school when they were young?

550
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,934
While I was forced
to study Shaolin Kung Fu,

551
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,410
and then become a cleaner,
washing dishes,

552
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:59,210
and cleaning out sewers?

553
00:38:59,684 --> 00:39:01,174
Calm down! Second Big Brother.

554
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:03,787
If you're brave enough,
you can control your fate.

555
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:06,015
Calm down? If I wasn't so calm,

556
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,592
I'd kill you guys!

557
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:11,252
Calm down?

558
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:14,598
Why are you just sitting here?

559
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:16,098
Can't you see how bad
it smells in here?

560
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,725
If it still stinks when I come back,
you'll be cleaning up with your tongue!

561
00:39:59,444 --> 00:40:01,378
Your apartment is great!

562
00:40:01,713 --> 00:40:03,806
It's well furnished.

563
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:06,113
I can't believe you work
as the cleaner downstairs,

564
00:40:06,351 --> 00:40:10,481
but live in the Penthouse
on the 59th floor.

565
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:13,182
You've got good taste!

566
00:40:13,325 --> 00:40:16,590
This kind of apartment is so popular

567
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:18,992
I can't even get one.

568
00:40:19,264 --> 00:40:22,256
The exhaust is okay.

569
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,027
Just a little bit noisy.

570
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:27,366
Would you mind if I move in here?

571
00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:42,485
Forget it!

572
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:45,021
Your Brothers aren't that great.

573
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:48,057
We can find others to join our team.

574
00:40:48,193 --> 00:40:51,026
It was all my fault.
I couldn't persuade them.

575
00:40:51,263 --> 00:40:52,890
It's okay.

576
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:55,622
You know, I'm so glad that you trust me.

577
00:40:55,767 --> 00:40:57,394
Thank you.

578
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:01,323
I'm going to train you guys
in the shortest time possible

579
00:42:01,466 --> 00:42:03,491
...to be professional soccer players.

580
00:42:03,635 --> 00:42:07,002
So you need to be serious
and mutually support each other.

581
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,298
I understand!

582
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,800
Let's go!

583
00:42:16,915 --> 00:42:18,815
Please listen to me!

584
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,475
What would you do if
you were in my position?

585
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,712
Yes, of course.

586
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,413
I've got to call.
Hold on a second.

587
00:42:25,557 --> 00:42:27,821
The ball is coming back!

588
00:42:34,766 --> 00:42:35,892
So! Finally willing
to come back, are you?

589
00:42:36,034 --> 00:42:39,197
- You made us wait for an hour
- Wait for an hour!

590
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:43,164
What are you doing?

591
00:42:43,308 --> 00:42:44,468
Playing soccer!

592
00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:46,770
The ball is over there!

593
00:42:52,817 --> 00:42:54,580
You, come here!

594
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:57,646
Let me see you kick the ball from here.

595
00:42:58,089 --> 00:42:58,817
But the ball is over there.

596
00:42:58,957 --> 00:43:00,754
Yes, the ball is over there!

597
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:04,089
You can't even get the ball.
How are you going to kick it from here?

598
00:43:05,363 --> 00:43:07,627
Listen up, there are four
basic skills to playing soccer:

599
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,563
Pass, stop, hold and kick.

600
00:43:09,701 --> 00:43:11,225
- I understand!
- Don't move!

601
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:14,201
Okay. Let's start from the beginning.

602
00:43:15,173 --> 00:43:16,640
Yours.

603
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,607
Hold it!

604
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:21,837
Watch out!

605
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,782
Concentrate!

606
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:29,045
Come on! Move!

607
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:30,484
That's it... do more fakes.

608
00:43:30,622 --> 00:43:32,613
That's better.
That looks like a good fake.

609
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:36,289
Do more fakes.

610
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:38,988
Fung, why can't I
participate in the training?

611
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:40,559
Look, even though your
leg's so strong,

612
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:43,394
you haven't got any control.

613
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:45,196
What happens if you...
kick the ball up into the sky...

614
00:43:45,336 --> 00:43:47,395
and it hits a plane?
Could you pay for it?

615
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:49,404
- No.
- So...

616
00:43:49,541 --> 00:43:51,941
Sixth Small Brother!
I'm borrowing your eggs!

617
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:53,008
What?

618
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:56,543
If you can control the egg freely
in the air, you can play soccer.

619
00:43:56,681 --> 00:43:58,410
- No problem!
- Okay!

620
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:02,148
You see? It's not that easy.

621
00:44:10,795 --> 00:44:13,730
Sixth Small Brother,
what are you doing!

622
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:21,739
Oh, no! My egg!

623
00:44:21,873 --> 00:44:23,636
Look, I'll get you another one later!

624
00:44:23,775 --> 00:44:25,333
No way!

625
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:26,944
Give it back to me!

626
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:29,069
Concentrate...

627
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,285
My egg!

628
00:44:50,735 --> 00:44:52,532
OK! Yes!

629
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,695
Yes! OK!

630
00:44:56,407 --> 00:44:58,671
Yours!

631
00:45:29,974 --> 00:45:32,169
Right...

632
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,076
Good...

633
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:48,451
Yes! Go!

634
00:46:06,077 --> 00:46:07,374
Keep your eye on the ball!
Watch out!

635
00:46:07,512 --> 00:46:09,673
How can you let him
kick it like that?

636
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,639
Kick it!

637
00:46:11,783 --> 00:46:13,683
Come on!

638
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:56,291
That's incredible!

639
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:59,327
He could play all by himself.

640
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:04,267
No! It's about teamwork.
You can't play soccer with just yourself.

641
00:47:14,212 --> 00:47:17,807
The game will be 30 minutes.
There are no breaks.

642
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:19,940
We'll follow the international rules.

643
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:22,382
I'm the referee.
Do you have any questions?

644
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,045
Of course not. You know how grateful
we are that Golden Leg is the referee

645
00:47:25,189 --> 00:47:27,487
and is leading a young soccer
team to play against us.

646
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,560
We're just happy to be here!

647
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:31,751
Say hi to Master Fung!

648
00:47:31,896 --> 00:47:32,828
- Hello Master Fung!

649
00:47:32,964 --> 00:47:34,090
Okay...

650
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:37,531
Well, this guy has some issues
with your team's players.

651
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:40,661
Now, this game is a demonstration
of our soccer playing skills.

652
00:47:40,805 --> 00:47:42,602
We'll use it to resolve this conflict.

653
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,230
Ah, we see! They look very intent.

654
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:47,037
From their tidy uniforms
and friendly faces,

655
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:50,511
I can feel deeply their sincerity
and the strength of their spirit.

656
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:51,842
Thank you!

657
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:55,745
It's okay, nothing to worry about.

658
00:47:55,887 --> 00:47:57,821
I'm an auto mechanic.

659
00:47:57,955 --> 00:48:00,924
I use this crescent wrench
to screw things down.

660
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:02,048
You understand, don't you?

661
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:03,820
Yes, of course.

662
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:07,729
Ah, as I already explained,

663
00:48:07,865 --> 00:48:09,765
the reason I have a hammer,

664
00:48:09,901 --> 00:48:11,892
is because I'm an auto mechanic.

665
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:14,061
Okay, okay. Your team's style...

666
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:15,866
...is infamous in
the amateur soccer world.

667
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:17,440
I understand.

668
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:19,709
Well, it's just an undeserved reputation.

669
00:48:19,844 --> 00:48:21,038
Looks like the sky's getting cloudy...

670
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:24,114
Okay. Anyway, take care of yourselves.

671
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:25,476
Shake hands, please!

672
00:48:54,112 --> 00:48:55,101
Pass it!

673
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:44,317
Help!

674
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:53,829
Third Big Brother!

675
00:51:21,025 --> 00:51:23,960
Calling military headquarters, we
just suffered an overwhelming attack.

676
00:51:24,095 --> 00:51:25,119
Send for reinforcements!

677
00:51:25,263 --> 00:51:26,855
Send for reinforcements!

678
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:40,843
Stand up.

679
00:51:42,513 --> 00:51:43,707
Stand up!

680
00:51:43,848 --> 00:51:45,179
Get up quickly!

681
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,608
Come on, get up!

682
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,419
What are you doing?

683
00:51:50,855 --> 00:51:51,480
Coach, they're lawless.

684
00:51:51,622 --> 00:51:52,680
Why don't you stop them?

685
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,723
I'm the referee.
I'm not supposed to stop them.

686
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:57,885
What's the meaning of this?
Do you want us to sacrifice ourselves?

687
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:00,326
Alright, you! Out!

688
00:52:01,732 --> 00:52:03,324
Are you nuts?

689
00:52:06,404 --> 00:52:07,962
This is a test.

690
00:52:08,105 --> 00:52:09,732
If you guys can't pass it,

691
00:52:09,874 --> 00:52:11,535
there's no way you're
playing soccer again!

692
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:14,509
We're just playing soccer.
We're not fighting a battle.

693
00:52:15,212 --> 00:52:19,012
Real soccer games are battles.

694
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,984
I surrender!

695
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:35,994
I surrender!

696
00:52:44,108 --> 00:52:46,338
I surrender!

697
00:52:46,477 --> 00:52:47,944
If you had the guts
to ask us to play,

698
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:49,910
why do you want to surrender?

699
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,537
Are you trying to mess with me?

700
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:58,552
I can't take it anymore.
My bones feel broken.

701
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:00,748
I'm a pitiful creature!

702
00:53:01,726 --> 00:53:03,660
Please let me go see a doctor!

703
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:11,694
Put it on your head!

704
00:53:13,537 --> 00:53:16,301
Look at you. You look like a dog.

705
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:18,441
Don't you have any self-respect?

706
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:20,006
I don't want to see your face again.

707
00:53:20,144 --> 00:53:22,510
Put it on your head quickly
and go see your doctor.

708
00:53:33,758 --> 00:53:40,163
Yes, I'm a dog.
I don't have any self-respect.

709
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:16,227
