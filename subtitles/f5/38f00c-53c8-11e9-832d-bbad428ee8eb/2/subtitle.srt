1
00:00:01,259 --> 00:00:02,783
Stop with the groveling.

2
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:05,555
I'm the one who needs
to thank all of you guys.

3
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:11,392
You're going to make me
filthy stinkin' rich! Thank you!

4
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,935
We're the losers.
But please give us the opportunity...

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:15,095
...to join your team!

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,139
Please!

7
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:24,010
Please, give us a chance.

8
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,384
Well, that was a pretty
good sized explosion.

9
00:01:34,518 --> 00:01:37,715
The Evil Team will be
the world champions for sure.

10
00:01:41,615 --> 00:01:42,215
Yes?

11
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,521
Who is it?

12
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:47,828
The cripple?

13
00:01:47,965 --> 00:01:50,024
- Why not?
- I'm sorry.

14
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:52,135
Look, I played professional
soccer for years,

15
00:01:52,269 --> 00:01:54,533
- you want to stop me?
- The person in charge isn't here right now.

16
00:01:54,672 --> 00:01:55,764
Golden Leg!

17
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:57,032
What are you doing?

18
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:58,607
- Hung!
- Hung, heh...

19
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,607
Okay...

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,974
Hung, my team wants to sign up
for the soccer tournament!

21
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,638
It's an open competition,
everyone has the right to sign up.

22
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:06,079
You're wrong.

23
00:02:06,217 --> 00:02:07,548
I'm the chairman.

24
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:10,152
I have the right to decide
who can sign up.

25
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,016
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

26
00:02:12,156 --> 00:02:13,646
What's the name of your team?

27
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,221
Come over here!

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,588
This is Hung.

29
00:02:18,028 --> 00:02:21,122
Hung!

30
00:02:35,112 --> 00:02:36,670
Get a load of this soccer team!

31
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:38,475
I'm dying to watch them play!

32
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:40,146
What's the name again?

33
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:42,013
This is Shaolin...

34
00:02:42,153 --> 00:02:43,677
OK...

35
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:46,153
Hurry and sign them up.
I really want to watch these guys.

36
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,757
If you'd like, I'll even pay
your application fee.

37
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:49,291
Thank you!

38
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:53,827
No problem! You, my lame friend,
are like a brother to me.

39
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,433
Ah, look at that.
My shoe is dirty again.

40
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,569
White gets dirty easily.

41
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,365
So...

42
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,571
I'll help you clean it up!

43
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,642
I'm good at cleaning.
Let me do it!

44
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,270
This is a job for me!

45
00:03:08,412 --> 00:03:10,243
Hey! Let me do it!

46
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,112
What a pack of idiots

47
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:36,065
Hi!

48
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,444
What are you doing?

49
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,774
Who are you?

50
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,317
Where are we going?

51
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:55,656
Why are you so quiet?
I need to go home.

52
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,529
Hey, we've been waiting
a long time for you.

53
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,864
I'm sorry.
Please, give me just a few minutes.

54
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:39,467
Try this one.

55
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,094
No. I just want to see the quality of it.

56
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,638
Touch it.

57
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:45,104
I'll get it dirty.

58
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,937
- No problem. Go ahead.
- No...

59
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:49,671
- Touch it.
- No.

60
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,351
- How's that?
- It's so smooth.

61
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:59,149
- I promise I'll buy one for you.
- I touched it already. That's enough.

62
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:03,725
Tomorrow, I'm going to start
playing in the soccer tournament.

63
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:05,021
Really?

64
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:07,824
I'm going to become
a famous star player.

65
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:11,890
But if you hadn't
helped me to repair these...

66
00:05:12,036 --> 00:05:14,027
I'd never have been able to play.

67
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:17,238
You know, you're so important to me.

68
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,338
Tell me whatever you want.

69
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:22,308
I'll be able to pay for it very soon.

70
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:29,876
If you become rich and famous,
please buy me some sneakers.

71
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,685
No problem!

72
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,883
But you should have more confidence.

73
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:38,957
I mean, really, you're a beautiful
girl, you're good at Kung Fu.

74
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:40,563
You know, you're perfect.

75
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:44,293
You shouldn't let your hair hang
down so it covers your face like that.

76
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,261
Come on.

77
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,537
- Come on. Look at me.
- No...

78
00:05:49,673 --> 00:05:51,664
Look at me!

79
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:55,139
You're so beautiful!

80
00:05:56,013 --> 00:05:57,310
Really?

81
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:58,938
Yes, of course.

82
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,419
Was it a fly?

83
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:07,615
Yes. But I didn't get it.

84
00:06:07,925 --> 00:06:08,721
Did you get it that time?

85
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,326
I did.

86
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:12,085
I'm sorry. I got your hand all dirty.

87
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,457
No problem.

88
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:16,532
You know, you're a real beautiful girl.

89
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:19,762
Don't you know that?

90
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Yes. I do.

91
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:23,301
Thank you! Thanks so much!

92
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,203
Don't you forget it!

93
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:28,268
Hey, where are you going?

94
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:31,472
I let you bring a girl in here because
you promised me you'd clean the store.

95
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,049
Hurry up! If you don't finish
the job on time, I'll get in trouble.

96
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:36,618
Go on home. I'll call you later.

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,114
Okay?

98
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:47,056
Remember! You should have confidence.
You're the best!

99
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,736
That's a nice shirt.

100
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,768
I like your socks, too.

101
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:55,201
- Let's switch clothes.
- Good idea...

102
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:56,897
Come on, guys! Haven't you
ever done this before?

103
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,100
Just pretend it's training as usual.

104
00:06:59,243 --> 00:07:01,234
There'll be hundreds of reporters
and spectators outside.

105
00:07:01,378 --> 00:07:02,572
You guys need to keep smiling...

106
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,839
...and let the reporters
take pictures with us.

107
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,246
You also need to say hi and
thank the fans for their support.

108
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:12,117
Thank you!

109
00:07:12,256 --> 00:07:13,223
Thank you!

110
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,257
Thanks for your support!

111
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:16,188
Thank you!

112
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:17,258
They're just the cleaners.

113
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,884
Cleaners are part of the audience too.

114
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:20,519
Thank you!

115
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:23,292
Shut up!

116
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:26,095
This auditorium is so small and empty.
You said...

117
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:27,726
This is just the first round.

118
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:30,499
So we need to play well
and get into the finals.

119
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:35,704
- Great! Get into the finals!
- Shut up!

120
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,514
Shaolin Team?

121
00:07:48,392 --> 00:07:50,292
Look at this guy!

122
00:07:53,797 --> 00:07:55,822
Look at that guy!

123
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:00,200
What's wrong?

124
00:08:00,804 --> 00:08:02,066
No smoking here?

125
00:08:16,453 --> 00:08:17,920
What just happened?

126
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,252
That's impossible! Just an illusion!

127
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,925
What are you doing?

128
00:08:34,571 --> 00:08:36,732
It's okay, just an illusion.

129
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:39,104
I think we should
show off our real power.

130
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:40,301
Great!

131
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,511
What's wrong?

132
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:57,049
Please don't play like that!
I really want to play soccer!

133
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:02,055
Hung, call for you.

134
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:10,098
I'm not scared. It's just an illusion.

135
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:46,935
What? Forty to nothing?
Is this a joke?

136
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,412
Yeah!

137
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:17,839
Goal! Yes! Iron Head!

138
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:54,677
Yes, we use Shaolin Kung Fu
to play soccer.

139
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:57,302
So Kung Fu is great, wonderful!

140
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:58,539
- We lie low...
- And...

141
00:10:58,682 --> 00:11:00,240
I want to thank my parents
and my Shaolin master.

142
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,544
Even though they've already passed away.

143
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:04,176
I also want to thank my good friend, Mui.

144
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:06,152
Mui... How are you?

145
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:09,187
Did you have dinner already?

146
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:21,662
Hello! Can I help you?

147
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:22,601
I want...

148
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:25,970
Say no more.
Let me take care of you!

149
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:35,785
Would you mind
showing us your Kung Fu?

150
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,352
Yes, of course. Sixth Small Brother?

151
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,755
1, 2, 3!

152
00:11:40,457 --> 00:11:42,288
Awesome!

153
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:44,519
Can you show us something else?

154
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:48,654
- Sure!
- Big Brother, one more please.

155
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,046
Hey, hey, take it easy!

156
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:10,811
My Brothers,

157
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:14,117
Today we say goodbye
to our old sneakers.

158
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,956
Don't throw stuff around here!

159
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:21,092
Sorry...

160
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:28,597
Hi.

161
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,059
Mui?

162
00:12:30,194 --> 00:12:31,684
What's up?

163
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:35,062
Wow, you look so different!

164
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,467
Not really.

165
00:12:38,603 --> 00:12:40,867
No, you're really decked out.

166
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:44,036
Do you like it?

167
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:45,267
I've got some good news for you!

168
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,435
You know my soccer team
won our matches hands down.

169
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:50,706
I know. I watched you guys on TV.

170
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:52,381
Congratulations!

171
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:54,581
Uh, this is for you.

172
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:02,887
Thank you.

173
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:05,188
Come on. Let me introduce
my friends to you.

174
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:06,821
Wow! How great is this!

175
00:13:07,098 --> 00:13:09,032
This is my friend...

176
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:11,359
Are you human or a ghost?

177
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,527
Oh, no! She's just a woman.

178
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:15,969
Ah, she's your girl, eh?

179
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:19,167
No, no, she's my friend, Mui.
She uses Tai Chi to make steamed bread.

180
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,572
Oh! It's her.

181
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:22,009
She's an unusual girl.

182
00:13:22,126 --> 00:13:23,140
Yes, she's one of a kind.

183
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:24,808
I can see that.

184
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:27,941
It looks like she's carrying a log across her
shoulders. I've never seen anything like it.

185
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,412
Hey, hey, I spent two whole nights
making these two pieces.

186
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,045
Two pieces.

187
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:36,589
Sing, you really shouldn't
be bringing her out at night.

188
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,218
She could scare someone to death.

189
00:13:39,197 --> 00:13:40,164
That wouldn't be a problem.

190
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,528
Then you could do the wake for them.

191
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:46,136
Hold on! We could tie her up
and toss her into the ocean.

192
00:13:46,304 --> 00:13:47,964
What, and you want to give up
eating seafood forever then?

193
00:13:48,973 --> 00:13:50,838
Okay, okay, knock it off! You all
shouldn't be treating a girl like this.

194
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,000
It's okay. I don't mind.

195
00:13:54,445 --> 00:13:56,811
Yeah, she's a soft and gentle girl,
but she's got a great sense of humor.

196
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,545
Hey Mui, give us a sexy pose.

197
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:09,582
How about another one?

198
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:20,098
- What's wrong?
- Don't touch me!

199
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:25,372
Are you upset with me?

200
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:28,271
No, I'm not.

201
00:14:29,881 --> 00:14:30,870
So you're...

202
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:38,655
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,458
I'm only kidding.

204
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:44,026
I know, you just think I'm a joke.

205
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:47,291
I'm sorry. Really, I don't care.

206
00:14:47,432 --> 00:14:48,922
Don't be like this.

207
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,160
Wh... why did you do this?

208
00:15:00,411 --> 00:15:01,935
Don't touch me!

209
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,947
Boss...

210
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:07,584
What's wrong with you?
I can't even go out to play Mahjong...

211
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:11,210
without finding you looking like
you're not even human or a ghost.

212
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:13,949
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

213
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:15,650
Enough already!

214
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:19,218
Mui has the right to decide
how she wants to look.

215
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,695
Can't you respect her decision?

216
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,801
I think she looks quite nice today.

217
00:15:24,602 --> 00:15:25,762
Don't you think she looks beautiful?

218
00:15:25,903 --> 00:15:27,234
You talk too much!

219
00:15:28,973 --> 00:15:30,873
This is none of your business.

220
00:15:31,008 --> 00:15:32,908
What makes you think you
can talk to me like that!

221
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:35,108
They're my friends.

222
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:40,347
What they're saying
is how I really feel.

223
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,788
I think I'm very beautiful right now.

224
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:49,353
I love my new look a lot.

225
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:55,162
If you don't like it,
you can get lost.

226
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:59,402
Hey! Who do you think
you're talking to?

227
00:16:00,438 --> 00:16:02,372
I'm talking to you.

228
00:16:03,474 --> 00:16:05,806
My cruel, cold boss.

229
00:16:05,943 --> 00:16:06,932
That's it!

230
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,673
You... do you think you're tough
enough to fight with me?

231
00:16:20,391 --> 00:16:21,915
You trying to rebel against me?

232
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:24,050
Who are you?

233
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,695
It's me.

234
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:29,925
I'm Mui!

235
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,725
I'm going to tell your Mom.

236
00:16:38,442 --> 00:16:40,034
Mui, you're awesome!

237
00:16:40,178 --> 00:16:43,079
Mui, we were just joking.
Please don't get mad at us.

238
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:47,241
Actually, your poses were great.

239
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,513
Really?

240
00:17:00,798 --> 00:17:02,356
I think...

241
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,794
I think I've changed a bit.

242
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:05,994
You'd better believe it.

243
00:17:06,137 --> 00:17:10,164
You've got confidence now.

244
00:17:16,814 --> 00:17:18,475
I want to tell you something.

245
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,913
What's that?

246
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,081
I like you!

247
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:24,778
I like you, too!

248
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,291
Is this love?

249
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:35,229
You...

250
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,731
You're kidding, right?

251
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:42,161
No. I'm serious.

252
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,908
Absolutely not. This isn't love.

253
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:52,348
We're friends, forever...

254
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,984
Don't you think we're good together?

255
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,911
Sure! We're fine.

256
00:18:04,295 --> 00:18:09,790
So, you'll come to see me often?

257
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:13,267
If your shoes get broken,
I'll help you fix them again.

258
00:18:13,404 --> 00:18:17,067
No, thanks. If my shoes get broken,
I'll just throw them away.

259
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:19,801
We should look forward to the future.

260
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:23,012
I'll never wear broken shoes again.

261
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:33,214
Don't be like this.

262
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:36,450
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

263
00:18:38,262 --> 00:18:39,991
Don't do this.

264
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,600
I understand.

265
00:18:55,346 --> 00:18:56,870
Goodbye!

266
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:02,817
Hey, come on over!

267
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:04,113
Mui, you're looking nice today.

268
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:05,654
Cheers!

269
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,830
After we win this game,
we'll be going to the finals.

270
00:19:15,969 --> 00:19:16,833
Going to the finals!

271
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,232
But we can't underestimate our opponent!

272
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:19,838
Underestimate our opponent!

273
00:19:23,543 --> 00:19:26,740
We're the more powerful team.

274
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:29,177
We won't let you get into the finals.

275
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,590
Holy cow! How'd they do that?

276
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,591
Must be special effects...

277
00:21:01,074 --> 00:21:02,132
Good morning, Hung!

278
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:03,573
Good morning!

279
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:04,904
Come on over here and sit down!

280
00:21:05,044 --> 00:21:07,638
You're a lucky man.

281
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,544
Very lucky to have such a great team.

282
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,546
Thank you.

283
00:21:10,683 --> 00:21:14,141
Looks like Iron Head and Iron Shirt
have even become quite popular.

284
00:21:14,287 --> 00:21:16,278
It's been amusing watching your
guys use Kung Fu to play soccer

285
00:21:16,456 --> 00:21:17,946
and get all the way to the finals.

286
00:21:18,091 --> 00:21:20,150
You've done a good job.

287
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,952
Hurry up, don't waste our time!

288
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,195
Give up the finals
and join my Evil Team!

289
00:21:28,368 --> 00:21:31,269
It's not a dirty bribe.

290
00:21:31,404 --> 00:21:33,998
You can get the money
before you sign on with me.

291
00:21:34,874 --> 00:21:36,466
This is a lot of money.

292
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,668
I could probably break my left
leg and retire on this.

293
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:41,713
Why not! We're brothers.

294
00:21:41,848 --> 00:21:43,509
Thank you.

295
00:21:43,783 --> 00:21:45,648
But I don't think I can't accept this.

296
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:49,421
What? Do you think I'm
trying to intimidate you?

297
00:21:49,556 --> 00:21:54,016
I think your team has great potential.
Maybe we could join together.

298
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,027
Don't get upset so easily.
Think about your future.

299
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:59,222
Forget our rivalry. Okay?

300
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:03,026
Hung, I wasn't thinking
of our rivalry.

301
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,663
I know it was all my fault.
I can't blame anyone else.

302
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:10,639
You're lying!

303
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,644
I know you too well.
You're too greedy!

304
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:18,473
You're right!

305
00:22:18,918 --> 00:22:22,115
I am greedy. My team is greedy, too.

306
00:22:22,255 --> 00:22:24,314
But we don't have an
insatiable greed for money.

307
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,119
We have an insatiable greed
for the championship.

308
00:22:27,927 --> 00:22:29,827
See you on the soccer field.

309
00:23:04,297 --> 00:23:05,958
Stop! Wait just a minute! Thank you!

310
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:12,766
Mui!

311
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:14,201
She died already!

312
00:23:14,574 --> 00:23:15,734
How come?

313
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:18,242
I killed her!

314
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:19,174
What!

315
00:23:19,312 --> 00:23:21,212
Mui is the master-hand of Tai Chi.

316
00:23:21,347 --> 00:23:23,440
She must not be treated unjustly!

317
00:23:23,583 --> 00:23:25,483
What do you want?

318
00:23:25,618 --> 00:23:27,449
Revenge!

319
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:30,151
Don't be silly! I'm just joking!

320
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:33,024
She's still alive.
She just doesn't work here anymore.

321
00:23:34,027 --> 00:23:35,426
Why?

322
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:38,693
You know, my little store
is well-known for sweet steamed bread.

323
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,059
But now the steamed bread...

324
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,689
she makes has become salty and bitter.

325
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:43,631
She's been ruining my business.

326
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:46,102
I didn't have another choice.

327
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:47,467
Salty and bitter?

328
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,131
Yes.

329
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:52,039
What's your name? Can I help?

330
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,814
No, thanks.

331
00:25:03,694 --> 00:25:05,685
Come on, we've got to go!

332
00:26:43,494 --> 00:26:46,691
Boss, how many goals
do you expect to score today?

333
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:50,098
Scoring goals isn't the only way to win.

334
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:53,395
I've got a great plan for winning today.

335
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:32,895
Impossible.

336
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:40,401
Those American drugs are
absolutely incredible!

337
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,393
And with the referees, linesmen,

338
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,985
soccer association, soccer federation
and soccer committee...

339
00:30:07,198 --> 00:30:09,325
all in my pocket.

340
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,332
How can they fight against me?

341
00:30:44,435 --> 00:30:47,131
No problem!

342
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,003
- Great!
- Way to go!

343
00:30:51,275 --> 00:30:52,867
Wonderful!

344
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:53,331
Throw-in?

345
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,564
He did that on purpose!

346
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,539
How can you call that a throw-in?

347
00:31:58,742 --> 00:32:01,768
Hung, are you fighting,
or playing soccer?

348
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:04,039
Yes, we are. So what?

349
00:32:04,181 --> 00:32:07,344
I ought to break all your legs
and turn all of you into cripples.

350
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,715
Cripples! Cripples!

351
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,116
How are you gonna fight against me?

352
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:16,415
I'm sorry I have to leave the game.

353
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,721
It's okay. You're just
leaving us physically,

354
00:32:18,863 --> 00:32:20,854
but your spirit will stay
in our hearts forever.

355
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:41,517
Move over! It's my turn.

356
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:01,196
Sixth Small Brother!

357
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:41,339
What's going on?
Why don't you stop them?

358
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,316
It's only halftime, and all
your guys are badly injured!

359
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:51,546
How are you going to
play the second half?

360
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:54,283
Go home! There's no way you
guys can play the second half!

361
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:55,585
There's nothing
interesting going on,

362
00:33:55,726 --> 00:33:58,286
Maybe I should go down there
and dance to give them a show.

363
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:01,523
No! It's not your show. It's mine!

364
00:34:06,804 --> 00:34:08,203
Damn you!

365
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:28,052
Break it up!

366
00:34:28,258 --> 00:34:29,987
You guys must not
want to play anymore!

367
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:32,856
Who did that?

368
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,152
Who saw that?

369
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,533
Hit me in the face,
if you're brave enough!

370
00:34:39,336 --> 00:34:40,132
Rub gently.

371
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,864
I can't believe they're even
more out of control than I am.

372
00:34:43,007 --> 00:34:44,406
I can't believe that...

373
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:46,702
my reputation has been ruined.

374
00:34:47,578 --> 00:34:50,741
I figured they'd try
to do something to us,

375
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,542
but even I can't believe
how cruel they've been.

376
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:54,207
The Evil Team isn't that great.

377
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:56,683
They must have taken drugs
or some kind of injection.

378
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,549
Call the police!

379
00:34:58,689 --> 00:34:59,621
Look,

380
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,018
We've got to try our best
to keep going.

381
00:35:01,158 --> 00:35:02,557
We'll win in the end!

382
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,752
My house is on fire, I've gotta run!

383
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,123
I'm sorry. My mom is
giving birth prematurely right now.

384
00:35:06,263 --> 00:35:07,821
I need to go home and take care of her.

385
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:09,254
Can't you ask her to wait
until the end of the game?

386
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,958
You can't give up now!

387
00:35:11,101 --> 00:35:12,898
They're not playing soccer.
They're killing us!

388
00:35:13,037 --> 00:35:15,005
I'm begging you.
Please don't leave us!

389
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,629
I'm begging you back.

390
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:17,796
Please let me go!

391
00:35:20,577 --> 00:35:23,512
Calm down!

392
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,581
Calm down!

393
00:35:26,383 --> 00:35:29,716
Yes, he's right!

394
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:33,721
We have to keep going.

395
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:35,484
Now, we only have eight players left.

396
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:37,457
If one more player gets injured,

397
00:35:37,594 --> 00:35:39,721
we'll forfeit.

398
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,763
We have to try our best to
defend against their killer kick.

399
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,562
Why should WE? If YOU defend one
killer kick, then I'll play defense for three.

400
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:47,227
What are you talking about?

401
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:51,874
Calm down!

402
00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:53,135
Calm down!

403
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:54,608
Shut up!

404
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,242
I'm not sure if I can
defend against it, but...

405
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,099
Shaolin Lu Han Array!

406
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,600
Array?

407
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:32,105
Can't stand against a shot like that!

408
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:35,410
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

409
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,924
Hello, Chun.

410
00:37:16,093 --> 00:37:17,924
- Tin?
- Yes.

411
00:37:18,395 --> 00:37:20,056
There's something I haven't
told you in many years,

412
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:22,791
but I really wanted
to tell you right now.

413
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,992
Chun, I love you!

414
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:13,779
Do you think we're being too cruel?

415
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:16,951
- I don't think so!
- Really?

416
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,214
So we can be harsher!

417
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,580
Brothers! Go!

418
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,857
What the...?

419
00:38:59,563 --> 00:39:01,554
Be careful!

420
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,021
Watch out!

421
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,219
Give me a break!

422
00:39:58,722 --> 00:40:01,782
Hurry and get up!
Quit acting like you're hurt!

423
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:04,951
Yeah, you're a genius!
I'm just fine.

424
00:40:10,133 --> 00:40:13,000
The game's almost over!
Use the final attack!

425
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,534
Final attack?

426
00:40:46,303 --> 00:40:48,362
Yes! That's it. Now you guys...

427
00:40:48,505 --> 00:40:49,836
...can't even stall for time.

428
00:40:50,374 --> 00:40:51,432
Game over!

429
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,305
Shaolin Team.

430
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:00,849
You've only got seven players left.

431
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:02,815
If you don't have any
substitute players,

432
00:41:02,953 --> 00:41:04,511
I'll stop the game...

433
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,053
and announce that the game's over.

434
00:41:11,862 --> 00:41:12,988
Any substitute players?

435
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,833
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

436
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:21,329
I'm ready!

437
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,402
I'm the substitute player.

438
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:25,834
I'm the goalkeeper.

439
00:41:32,649 --> 00:41:35,015
What are you making out
like E.T. For?

440
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:38,453
I didn't know how to cut my hair,
so I thought it'd be easier to shave it.

441
00:41:38,588 --> 00:41:39,953
What for?

442
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,613
I want to help you.

443
00:41:41,758 --> 00:41:42,816
How can you help us?

444
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,392
Go back to Mars,

445
00:41:44,528 --> 00:41:46,086
Earth is too dangerous.

446
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:47,161
I really want to help you.

447
00:41:47,297 --> 00:41:48,525
Trust me! Let me try!

448
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:52,260
- No way!
- Look,

449
00:41:52,402 --> 00:41:53,767
your shoes are broken.

450
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,098
Put these on.

451
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:44,018
The OTHER side.

452
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:57,829
Go!

453
00:42:58,568 --> 00:42:59,364
Alright!

454
00:43:14,918 --> 00:43:16,078
Watch out!

455
00:45:25,048 --> 00:45:27,778
What happened?

456
00:45:27,917 --> 00:45:29,214
What just happened?

457
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,819
Boss, watch out?

458
00:45:30,954 --> 00:45:32,649
Damn it!

459
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,919
Boss!

460
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,894
Boss!

461
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:11,077
"Shaolin Team Wins
the Championship"

462
00:47:13,256 --> 00:47:15,315
"Evil Team Gets Permanent
Suspension for Drug Use"

463
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,655
"Coach Hung gets sentenced
to 5 years in prison"

464
00:48:35,905 --> 00:48:41,275
Wait! Stop the bus!
