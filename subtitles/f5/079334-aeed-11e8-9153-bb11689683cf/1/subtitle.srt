1
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:56,960
Hey, it's Beach Festival today,
do you think Yim Wing Chun will come?

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,178
Sure, she'll be here.

3
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,566
Wow, look at all these people!

4
00:01:03,302 --> 00:01:05,571
My information is always accurate.

5
00:01:05,606 --> 00:01:06,272
That's true.

6
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,364
If Wing Chun is not coming,

7
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,891
why would there be so many
merchants here?

8
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,362
Aren't they afraid of the bandits?

9
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,025
Waiter, is Master Yim here yet?

10
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,118
Yes, she's been here for a while.

11
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:18,429
Let's go in.

12
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:19,165
Alright.

13
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,436
A man should be more decisive...

14
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:22,302
Yes or No.

15
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:23,767
Why are you so wishy washy?

16
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:26,365
Are you still thinking?
It's getting late!

17
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:29,632
How about this.
I'll give you another discount...

18
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,144
You aren't very sincere.
How about this...

19
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,955
Master Yim is really shrewd.

20
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:41,046
No, that's Master Yim's aunt,

21
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,223
Abacus Fong.

22
00:01:44,732 --> 00:01:47,797
Oh, she is? She's notorious!

23
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,209
I heard that she grew up
eating stinky tofu,

24
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,452
that's why she has bad breadth.

25
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:52,113
Yes, it stinks!

26
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:53,912
I'm very sincere, look!

27
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:57,911
Bastard! How dare you!

28
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,407
What's so funny?

29
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:06,163
Forget it. I'm leaving.

30
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,188
Don't go!

31
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:08,660
She's leaving?

32
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,311
There she is...

33
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:19,240
Master, how come Yim Wing Chun
is dressed like a man?

34
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:24,104
Stupid. She dresses like a man
but she is still impressive.

35
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:28,233
Good. Let's hire her
to be the head of security.

36
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:29,200
Wait...

37
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:34,859
But Master, those bandits
are after our family fortune.

38
00:02:34,895 --> 00:02:36,618
We cannot wait any longer.

39
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,852
I have a better idea.

40
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:42,022
It will cost a fortune to hire her,

41
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:46,696
but if I marry her,
I'll just have to feed her, right?

42
00:02:46,955 --> 00:02:49,126
Master, are you kidding?

43
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:50,600
Of course not! Let's go.

44
00:02:52,682 --> 00:02:54,405
Run! The bandits are coming!

45
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:57,351
Bandits! What should we do?
Hurry. Let's leave!

46
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,052
Oh, I've got an idea.

47
00:03:02,088 --> 00:03:03,332
Maybe it'll work.

48
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,742
You bandits rob our residents
and the businesses.

49
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:12,189
I, Wong Hok Chow and
Yim Wing Chun are here today.

50
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,083
How dare you stir up trouble!

51
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,861
Listen, we are not here
to disturb your businesses.

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,885
We just want to invite you to
our fortress to discuss a joint venture.

53
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:27,996
How dare you blackmail us
in broad daylight!

54
00:03:28,353 --> 00:03:31,222
Shut up! I think we'll have to use
force to reason with you.

55
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:32,413
You have a bad mouth!

56
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,196
Who's calling me?

57
00:03:37,822 --> 00:03:38,749
None of my business.

58
00:03:46,428 --> 00:03:47,126
Go to hell!

59
00:03:58,937 --> 00:03:59,732
I'll protect you!

60
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,987
Master...

61
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:22,955
Master, are you alright?

62
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:24,558
I've driven the bandits away.

63
00:04:24,595 --> 00:04:27,594
Scholar, your courage has
driven the bandits away.

64
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,007
You have my utmost respect.

65
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,234
Thanks for your help.
I'm very grateful.

66
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:36,235
It's our pleasure to help you.

67
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,627
I will visit you soon
to show my appreciation.

68
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,463
It's not necessary.
Go before the bandits return.

69
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:50,471
Yes.

70
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,303
Good-bye.

71
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,484
Good-bye.

72
00:04:53,963 --> 00:04:56,864
We'll be very safe if she is with us.

73
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:01,032
Master, women who fight are no good
even if they're beautiful.

74
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:03,140
Master, you should be careful.

75
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,224
Narrow-minded.

76
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:07,041
Good-bye.

77
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:09,889
I think this scholar is
really something.

78
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:12,226
Are you interested in him?

79
00:05:12,774 --> 00:05:14,018
Didn't you say
you would not get married?

80
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:15,297
Yes, I did.

81
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,084
Your dad will be upset at me again.

82
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:34,878
Where is he?

83
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,003
Who hit me?

84
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,015
You must have offended many people.

85
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:41,850
Let's go.

86
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:47,927
I've been trying very hard to be
a matchmaker for your family.

87
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:51,575
You are very lucky to have someone
marry your second daughter.

88
00:05:51,964 --> 00:05:54,451
Thank you. You have worked hard.

89
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:55,473
They are over there.

90
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:56,727
My youngest daughter...

91
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:58,004
Oh, I must leave now.

92
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,115
Dad.

93
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,679
Why did she leave in such a hurry?

94
00:06:02,265 --> 00:06:04,533
To her, you are scarier than a ghost!

95
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:05,429
You...

96
00:06:05,464 --> 00:06:08,082
Now that my daughter
is working with you,

97
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,898
you must be making a lot of money.

98
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:14,578
My brother,
you and Wing Chow are set for life,

99
00:06:14,613 --> 00:06:16,784
But Wing Chun and I
have to take care of ourselves.

100
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,617
Shut up.

101
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:19,952
You have spoiled her.

102
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:22,447
I didn't teach her kung-fu.

103
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:24,562
Can't you be quiet?

104
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,888
It's all your fault.

105
00:06:30,354 --> 00:06:34,411
Aunt Abacus, let's stop quarreling.
I'm getting married tomorrow.

106
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,815
Let's have a happy Beach Festival Day.

107
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,309
Alright, I'll forget it,

108
00:06:39,343 --> 00:06:41,350
It's not going to kill me anyway.

109
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,172
The River God has possessed
the sorcerer's body.

110
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:57,218
Yes. Governor,
we the three Southern Masters...

111
00:06:57,258 --> 00:07:00,127
from the Brilliant Kung Fu School
are here to pay our respect.

112
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,121
What a beauty!

113
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,884
What a beauty!

114
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:21,442
What are you looking at?

115
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:22,654
Why can't I just look?

116
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:25,406
I'm Charmy. My husband is very ill

117
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:29,435
and I have come a long distance
to beg for some divine water.

118
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,838
Divine water is not for outsiders.

119
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,784
Please don't send me away.

120
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,673
Please have mercy!

121
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:43,228
I've come a long distance,
my husband is very ill.

122
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,507
What a pity!

123
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,067
Wing Chow,
if your husband becomes like him,

124
00:07:47,102 --> 00:07:48,312
your life will be ruined.

125
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,261
Watch your words.

126
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,762
I'm telling you the truth!
Let me finish...

127
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,316
My brother,
if her husband gets syphilis, then...

128
00:07:59,034 --> 00:08:00,561
I'm fine! I'm not hurt!

129
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:03,984
Here comes the bandits again!

130
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:07,279
Don't worry.

131
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,181
Bandits...

132
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:17,936
Let's get that beauty
for our 2nd Fortress Lord.

133
00:08:22,548 --> 00:08:23,442
Help!

134
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:25,329
Help!

135
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:26,410
Go help her.

136
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,727
Why don't you go?

137
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:28,946
Help!

138
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,174
What should we do?

139
00:08:32,242 --> 00:08:33,518
Don't worry, don't worry.

140
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,230
Good. Wing Chun is here.

141
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:42,921
Old Yim, keep an eye on your daughter.

142
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:43,907
Yes.

143
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,476
Make sure she doesn't mess
in our affairs.

144
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:46,979
We won't put up with it any longer.

145
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,420
Come on, lady.

146
00:08:56,587 --> 00:08:59,402
It's too late. They're here already.

147
00:09:02,026 --> 00:09:03,073
Help!

148
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:05,380
Let's go.

149
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:33,245
Hit them!

150
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,701
Yim Wing Chun.

151
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:40,732
I don't care who you are. Get her!

152
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,209
Alright!

153
00:09:57,243 --> 00:09:58,258
Shut your bad mouth.

154
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:00,022
Nothing good happens
when you are around.

155
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:00,854
Bravo!

156
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,792
Hey, it's only the back of the sword!

157
00:10:41,872 --> 00:10:43,181
Help!

158
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:57,504
Help!

159
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:10,757
Help!

160
00:11:14,952 --> 00:11:16,293
Help!

161
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:28,220
Don't be afraid. The bandits are gone.

162
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,310
Hey, you! Watch out!

163
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,860
I'll be back for you!!

164
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:38,909
Yim Wing Chun rescued the girl.

165
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:42,239
Your husband is over here.

166
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:45,310
My husband, are you alright?

167
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:46,966
Waiter.

168
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,053
Yes, Master Yim.

169
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,211
Take him to the guest room
and find a doctor for him.

170
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:53,016
Yes.

171
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,545
Your dad doesn't need
your sister to do her chores today

172
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,307
because she's getting married tomorrow.

173
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:13,970
So he's making you do it?

174
00:12:14,456 --> 00:12:16,278
What's so special about
getting married?!

175
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:19,474
I bet you, she'll have to work
like a dog after she's married.

176
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,393
Shall we hire someone to help you?

177
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:22,738
Are you feeling generous?

178
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:24,974
In that case, you do it all.

179
00:12:28,404 --> 00:12:30,771
Since you're not getting married,
you have to do it.

180
00:12:31,347 --> 00:12:33,452
What about you?

181
00:12:40,113 --> 00:12:41,673
The bridegroom is very ugly.

182
00:12:45,295 --> 00:12:47,270
It's all my fault.

183
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:48,870
We're leaving.

184
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:50,475
Sister, let's go.

185
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:51,915
Let's go.

186
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:04,129
Wing Chow, if your husband yells
at you... What are you looking at?

187
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:06,985
I'll pluck your eye balls out!
...you should come home immediately.

188
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:09,384
Don't lose face for the family.

189
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:11,778
You be quiet!!

190
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:13,983
My brother, you should be
more careful on the road.

191
00:13:14,024 --> 00:13:17,700
You're old and may die
before you return.

192
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,479
You should watch your mouth.

193
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,267
I meant well.

194
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,985
But he doesn't like to hear it.

195
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:31,354
Congratulations! Congratulations on
your daughter's wedding day.

196
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:35,031
I'm Scholar Wong Hok Chow.

197
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:37,376
I've brought some musicians
to celebrate with you.

198
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:38,649
Stop.

199
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:44,351
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

200
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:48,212
I came to show my gratitude to
Miss Wing Chun for saving my life.

201
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:50,780
I'm really fond of her.

202
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:54,907
That's marvelous, that's marvelous.

203
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,694
It's getting close to the lucky hour.
Let's go.

204
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,351
Good. We don't have to wait for
you fiancee Leung Pok To anymore.

205
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:01,434
If we miss the lucky hour,

206
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:04,728
it'll ruin the peace in our family.
Let's go.

207
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:06,585
Let's go.

208
00:14:10,394 --> 00:14:11,637
Good-bye.

209
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,568
Uncle Yim, don't worry.
I'll take care of Wing Chun.

210
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:28,336
We are going to be rich! Look at all
these customers waiting for us.

211
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:30,890
Excuse me...

212
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,624
Yim Wing Chun,
we're are going to shame you today.

213
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,392
We have invited the renowned
Master Wong to teach you a lesson.

214
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,304
Fat chance!

215
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:56,007
When it comes to martial arts,
men are always better than women...

216
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,728
but when it comes to bearing children,
that's a different matter.

217
00:14:58,925 --> 00:15:01,063
I'll win for sure today.

218
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:06,277
Wing Chun, after my lesson today,
go home and bear children.

219
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:08,391
This guy's mouth is worse than yours.

220
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:11,747
But your dad didn't want you to fight.

221
00:15:12,106 --> 00:15:13,479
But Dad is not here.

222
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:14,472
That's right.

223
00:15:14,633 --> 00:15:15,712
Kick his butt.

224
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,516
If you can smash the tofu,
you are the winner.

225
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:23,458
I'll beat you

226
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:25,152
until you surrender.

227
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,295
Master Wong!

228
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:03,579
Looks like I have to get serious.

229
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,758
I want you to crawl out of here!

230
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:43,913
You had enough?

231
00:16:45,201 --> 00:16:46,030
No.

232
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:49,642
He won't surrender.
Hit him until he does.

233
00:16:50,288 --> 00:16:52,807
No, not "hit". "Teach".

234
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:22,339
Master Wong, why...
why don't you go back to your farm?

235
00:17:24,295 --> 00:17:26,498
Get out of our way! Come!

236
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:33,309
A beautiful girl is selling herself
to bury her husband.

237
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,592
Let's go!

238
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:36,513
Who could that be?

239
00:17:40,386 --> 00:17:46,876
The husband of this woman died without
leaving any money for his burial.

240
00:17:46,913 --> 00:17:49,694
She is willing to sell herself.
Bid starts at 10 taels.

241
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,931
The highest bidder can take her home.

242
00:17:51,968 --> 00:17:52,436
10 taels.

243
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,046
11.

244
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,297
12.

245
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,262
12.50

246
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:56,156
13 taels.

247
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,953
15 taels.

248
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:05,362
Look at you!

249
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,224
You're drooling.

250
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,098
No, I'm just touched
by her faithfulness.

251
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,032
I don't want her to fall into
the hands of lustful men.

252
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:14,902
30 taels.

253
00:18:18,617 --> 00:18:22,675
Scholar Wong, you must help her.

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,195
You must have some money to spare.

255
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:29,011
No?

256
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,348
Don't force him.

257
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,646
Not at all. How much?

258
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,694
100 taels.

259
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:37,423
You think I'm a millionaire?

260
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,032
Thank you, Scholar Wong.

261
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:46,351
Don't mention it.

262
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,481
This 5 taels is for the rent.

263
00:18:49,553 --> 00:18:50,600
Thank you, Master Yim.

264
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,048
Use this to bury your husband,

265
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,324
and use the remaining to go home.

266
00:18:58,063 --> 00:18:58,793
Thank you.

267
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,391
My name is Charmy.

268
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:01,834
I'm homeless now.

269
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,944
Would you take me in please?

270
00:19:04,492 --> 00:19:05,986
In this case, come with us.

271
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:08,547
You can stay with us.
We'll pay for the burial.

272
00:19:08,812 --> 00:19:10,753
The rest of the money will be for food.

273
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:11,689
Let's go home.

274
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:13,126
Please.

275
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,558
Let's go back to our fortress.

276
00:19:17,162 --> 00:19:17,827
Let's go.

277
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:32,798
Hail, 2nd Fortress Lord.

278
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:35,684
Hail, 2nd Fortress Lord.

279
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,907
Those two men want to join us
in the fight against Yim Wing Chun.

280
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,907
Yes.

281
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,570
Tell them to come over here.

282
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,258
Come.

283
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,594
Since you two were not killed
by the arrows,

284
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,419
this proves your loyalty to us.

285
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:00,599
Let's go upstairs.

286
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:18,229
Give them the Fearless Wine.

287
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,497
No...

288
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:36,691
What have you heard
about Yim Wing Chun?

289
00:20:38,164 --> 00:20:40,978
The woman bought Yim Wing Chun.

290
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:45,866
No, Yim Wing Chun bought the woman.

291
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,202
This is ridiculous.

292
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,051
This bloody woman

293
00:20:51,857 --> 00:20:54,856
takes whoever she wants

294
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,607
and now she's taken my woman.

295
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:02,125
I must save Charmy
and kill Yim Wing Chun!

296
00:21:02,766 --> 00:21:06,540
Kill Yim Wing Chun!

297
00:21:11,724 --> 00:21:13,000
Hey Wing Chun!

298
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:19,490
Look at you.
Since you've taken up kung-fu

299
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,122
you've lost all your femininity.

300
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:24,030
Now you're muscular all over.

301
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:25,414
No wonder nobody buys
our tofu any more.

302
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:27,171
We still had some customers
when your sister was here.

303
00:21:27,207 --> 00:21:28,898
If I depend on you,
I'll starve to death.

304
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:33,306
Don't worry, our tofu is made
with the finest ingredients.

305
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:36,131
Nowadays, customers look for more.

306
00:21:36,293 --> 00:21:38,845
The men won't buy from us
if we aren't attractive.

307
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:41,501
Therefore, I've trained another
Tofu Beauty.

308
00:21:41,956 --> 00:21:42,719
Come on out.

309
00:21:47,202 --> 00:21:49,984
I have dressed her up
in your old clothes.

310
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:54,458
If she can't attract those men,
I'll write my name upside down!

311
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,135
Not bad, eh?

312
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:01,150
Your clothes are very pretty.

313
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:06,105
Turn around. Doesn't she look like you
when you were younger?

314
00:22:08,477 --> 00:22:09,142
Yes.

315
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:10,996
Really?

316
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:11,799
Yes.

317
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:14,708
You will start selling tofu tomorrow.

318
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,176
You'll be the new Tofu Beauty.

319
00:22:16,219 --> 00:22:16,786
Okay.

320
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,279
Let me show you a couple of my moves.
Give me a sexy pose.

321
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,434
Chest up, stomach in.

322
00:22:20,793 --> 00:22:24,305
It's alright to show some cleavage.

323
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:27,821
Start practicing.

324
00:22:30,678 --> 00:22:31,856
Are you alright?

325
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:35,403
Time flies.
So many years have gone by already.

326
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,972
If you put on those clothes again,

327
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:38,257
you'll look just as good.

328
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,052
I'm used to this look already. Every
thing will be fine now that we have her.

329
00:22:43,092 --> 00:22:45,033
You know I didn't mean to hurt you.

330
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,401
I know. You're just brainless.

331
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:57,990
Tofu Beauty, please sell us some tofu.

332
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:00,202
I've come very early this morning.

333
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:03,113
Please don't push.

334
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,965
I can't serve you if you don't line up.

335
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:08,457
We've come early to wait in line.

336
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:09,353
Excuse me.

337
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,533
You guys can line up now.

338
00:23:12,556 --> 00:23:14,694
Boy, that stinks.

339
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,335
Get in line if you want tofu.

340
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,832
Yeah, line up.

341
00:23:25,992 --> 00:23:27,617
She's such a seductress.

342
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:32,830
Is it sweet?

343
00:23:33,894 --> 00:23:35,869
Very sweet. Give me another.

344
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,048
Bastard!
One per customer, follow the rules.

345
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,012
I want two bowls.

346
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:39,998
Okay.

347
00:23:40,036 --> 00:23:41,694
I want three bowls.

348
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,492
I'll stand in line again.

349
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:51,448
Wonderful.
She's doing even better than you did.

350
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:54,077
People used to be more polite.

351
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,046
We're going to be rich!

352
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:03,384
You have a sweet smile.

353
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:06,292
Really? Thank you.

354
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:16,858
I don't want fresh tofu.
I want preserved tofu.

355
00:24:17,115 --> 00:24:17,845
Okay.

356
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:20,847
Soy Bean Milk is all sold out!

357
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,548
I have some...

358
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,032
You do? We don't think so.

359
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,888
Is he flirting with me?

360
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:31,533
It's been so long.
I'm not used to this anymore.

361
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,013
No, not that one, the one up there.

362
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:42,995
No, over there.

363
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:49,964
Oh, your idea really works!

364
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:53,097
Further.

365
00:24:53,137 --> 00:24:55,439
Over there.

366
00:25:00,655 --> 00:25:02,597
You guys are so bad!

367
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,446
Told you it's not that one,
it's the first one!

368
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:06,699
Charmy!

369
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:09,222
Scholar Wong.

370
00:25:09,486 --> 00:25:10,249
Let me help you.

371
00:25:10,317 --> 00:25:11,015
That's okay.

372
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:13,541
It's alright, I'll hold on to you.

373
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:14,857
Okay.

374
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,969
Master Yim, let me help you.

375
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:24,870
Thanks, I can do it myself.

376
00:25:24,905 --> 00:25:25,668
Let me help you.

377
00:25:25,737 --> 00:25:26,598
I'm alright.

378
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,007
I got it.

379
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:30,946
Are you alright?

380
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:31,911
I'm fine.

381
00:25:33,255 --> 00:25:35,621
Master Yim, you are really strong.

382
00:25:35,783 --> 00:25:37,375
I really admire that...

383
00:25:40,933 --> 00:25:43,202
Scholar Wong, since you're so helpful,
why don't you help me grind the beans.

384
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:44,163
Come on...

385
00:25:44,196 --> 00:25:45,341
It's a pleasure to help others.

386
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,492
Thank you very much.

387
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:15,544
We're running out of time.
Here, let me help you.

388
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:27,761
Harder...

389
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:38,414
I'm exhausted.

390
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,923
Stop! I have respect for you.
Don't do this to me!

391
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:46,156
I thought you enjoyed it.

392
00:26:46,708 --> 00:26:50,220
I'm a respectful scholar.
If people see us like this,

393
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,778
my good name will be ruined.

394
00:26:54,162 --> 00:26:57,096
Confucius! Mencius!

395
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,860
Give me your guidance!

396
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:01,928
Sooner or later you'll be mine.

397
00:27:07,663 --> 00:27:10,477
Yim's tofu is really sweet and soft.

398
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,219
I think the Tofu Beauty's
fragrance is much sweeter.

399
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:15,078
Excuse me

400
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:15,749
What?

401
00:27:15,821 --> 00:27:17,315
Did you buy that from the Yim's store?

402
00:27:17,356 --> 00:27:21,184
Even people from other places
have heard about the Tofu Beauty.

403
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:22,917
No, I've known her
for more than 10 years already.

404
00:27:22,987 --> 00:27:25,091
Now so many men
are interested in Wing Chun?

405
00:27:25,162 --> 00:27:26,090
You're nuts!

406
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:27,523
It smells so good.

407
00:27:34,664 --> 00:27:35,973
Tofu please.

408
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,714
Excuse me.

409
00:27:43,302 --> 00:27:44,959
Excuse me please.

410
00:27:54,274 --> 00:27:57,056
Who dropped the money?
Hey, who dropped the money?

411
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,162
I did!

412
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:07,961
She's such a beauty.

413
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,992
We haven't seen each other for
ten years. Do you recognize me?

414
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:13,370
You are Mister...

415
00:28:13,406 --> 00:28:15,194
I came from Fook Chow.

416
00:28:15,228 --> 00:28:17,300
You've come so far to buy
soy bean milk?

417
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:23,155
Yes. I'm out of bowls.
Let me get some from inside.

418
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,484
Don't bother. Put it in here.

419
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,566
Fine.

420
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:37,137
It's full.

421
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:39,439
Yes, yes.

422
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:41,075
It smells good.

423
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,907
Tofu Beauty, fill my hands too.

424
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,202
You really are the Tofu Beauty?

425
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,686
They're just joking.
Five cents please.

426
00:29:00,082 --> 00:29:00,845
Here.

427
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:07,368
Are you tired?

428
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:08,269
No.

429
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:15,811
She has a lover already...

430
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:19,497
Thank you.

431
00:29:28,777 --> 00:29:29,443
Watch your step.

432
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:30,212
Okay.

433
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:48,317
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

434
00:29:48,517 --> 00:29:49,858
I am Scholar Wong.

435
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:52,154
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

436
00:29:52,388 --> 00:29:54,427
I'm Leung Pok To,
I've come to pay a visit...

437
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:57,504
Visit? Are you a government official?

438
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,518
He's ranked higher than you.

439
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:03,417
Officer, why are you visiting so late?

440
00:30:03,873 --> 00:30:06,971
What are you talking about?
I'm here to visit Wing Chun.

441
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,266
So we came for the same reason.

442
00:30:10,463 --> 00:30:12,284
See you later.

443
00:30:12,926 --> 00:30:14,354
Let's go.

444
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,174
Wow, he's good!

445
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,934
Hurry up.

446
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,462
I don't want to miss anything.

447
00:30:48,117 --> 00:30:48,946
Fabulous!

448
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:55,887
Who are you?

449
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:57,804
I'm Flying Monkey.

450
00:30:58,002 --> 00:30:59,977
Don't you dare touch me.
Yim Wing Chun is here!

451
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,384
I've come to invite you
to our fortress.

452
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:10,151
Smells good!

453
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,297
What's going on?

454
00:31:31,338 --> 00:31:32,482
Charmy, what's the matter?

455
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,870
A bandit tried to abduct me.

456
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:37,832
Bandit?

457
00:32:43,287 --> 00:32:45,742
Be reasonable.
We're all here to have fun.

458
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:47,308
Why do you want to fight with me?

459
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,251
Wing Chun is my fiancee,
don't you dare touch her.

460
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:25,482
I'm leaving!

461
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:47,741
Stop. It's not him.

462
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,091
I've got this back for you.

463
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:57,375
Sir...

464
00:33:58,851 --> 00:33:59,833
It's not him?

465
00:34:00,131 --> 00:34:01,538
No, you're mistaken.

466
00:34:02,786 --> 00:34:05,535
Flying Monkey must have raped Charmy.

467
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:13,242
Stay here.

468
00:34:25,244 --> 00:34:27,251
You risked your life
to save me last night.

469
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,080
Why won't you talk to me now?

470
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:37,298
Please tell me what's wrong.

471
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:42,036
I studied martial arts for six years
to protect you,

472
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:45,616
but was beaten by your lover.

473
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:50,387
The one who fought with you last night

474
00:34:50,645 --> 00:34:52,336
is not my lover.

475
00:34:55,092 --> 00:34:57,644
He's not? Thank God!

476
00:34:58,483 --> 00:34:59,628
Then who is he?

477
00:35:00,371 --> 00:35:03,153
She saved my life and she is my master.

478
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,430
I respect her.

479
00:35:04,914 --> 00:35:05,994
How confusing.

480
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:08,109
Did you repay him with your body?

481
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:11,272
I belong to her already.

482
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,407
There goes my chance.

483
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,359
I'm only kidding.

484
00:35:16,591 --> 00:35:18,151
Wing Chun is a woman.

485
00:35:18,511 --> 00:35:21,445
What? You are not a virgin anymore?
Oh my god.

486
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,427
Master Yim, the doctor is here.

487
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:26,570
She's here. I must go.

488
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,531
Are you alright?

489
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:38,884
You are secretly seeing a man.
I must tell Wing Chun.

490
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,913
You won't...

491
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,217
I won't if you and I...

492
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:46,465
Whatever.

493
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,710
Let's see what's going on inside.

494
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,296
My friend, I'm sorry about last night.

495
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:06,077
I can't blame anyone,
my kung-fu isn't good enough.

496
00:36:06,338 --> 00:36:07,265
You're too humble.

497
00:36:07,489 --> 00:36:08,667
What is your name?

498
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,260
You don't need to know
the name of a loser.

499
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,030
Your wound is not that serious

500
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,533
but your sorrow can make it worse.

501
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,085
Frankly speaking,

502
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:22,291
my lover has left me.

503
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:26,459
Love hurts.

504
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,251
I wish them happiness.

505
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:31,579
Wing Chun really admires
your graciousness.

506
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:35,985
Admires me? It would be better
if Wing Chun marries me.

507
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:37,367
Pardon me?

508
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:40,408
I'm talking about how I feel.

509
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,062
Do you know how I feel?

510
00:36:42,296 --> 00:36:43,441
Not now.

511
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,687
I'll kill myself
if you don't believe me.

512
00:36:48,088 --> 00:36:49,232
Don't open the window.

513
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:53,492
Fresh air is good for your health.

514
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:55,310
I really would kill myself.

515
00:36:56,117 --> 00:36:57,230
I don't want to die.

516
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:04,649
That hurts!

517
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,826
I was only joking...

518
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:08,588
I didn't mean it.

519
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:26,053
Leave her alone.

520
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:30,154
Your husband just passed away
and already you have two men.

521
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,383
The whole town is talking about you.

522
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,721
You have not only
embarrassed yourself,

523
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:38,274
but you have also ruined our reputation.

524
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:39,654
Put it down.

525
00:37:42,696 --> 00:37:44,518
Let me ask you, are all men

526
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,406
attracted to widows?

527
00:37:48,296 --> 00:37:50,662
You're just jealous.

528
00:37:50,951 --> 00:37:53,252
Yes, I am.

529
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:54,751
Charmy, tell me,

530
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:59,261
is it true that
you can't live without a man?

531
00:37:59,972 --> 00:38:00,768
Yes.

532
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:05,018
I'm not as smart as the two of you.

533
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,817
Wing Chun, you're brave and strong.

534
00:38:06,883 --> 00:38:08,987
And Abacus, you're a business woman.

535
00:38:09,762 --> 00:38:12,282
I'm just an ordinary woman.

536
00:38:13,217 --> 00:38:16,761
My only wish is to marry a man
who loves me,

537
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,832
bear children for him, raise them,

538
00:38:19,903 --> 00:38:22,685
so that they'll take care of me
when I'm old.

539
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,946
But ever since I got married,
my husband has been ill.

540
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,625
I've searched many years for a cure.

541
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,666
I sold everything
and spent all our money.

542
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:36,275
He asked me to leave him.

543
00:38:37,435 --> 00:38:38,995
I thought about it,

544
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:42,645
but I stayed until he passed away.

545
00:38:43,769 --> 00:38:46,702
I feel that I don't owe him anything.

546
00:38:48,088 --> 00:38:51,284
She is indeed an ill-fortuned woman.

547
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:54,827
Don't you have any sympathy?

548
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,731
No.

549
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,421
If I'm given a second chance,

550
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:04,367
I'll make full use of it.

551
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:06,698
Right. You think so too?

552
00:39:07,571 --> 00:39:12,042
I have two choices,
one is rich and mature,

553
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:14,856
the other is romantic and good-looking.

554
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:17,833
I can't make up my mind.

555
00:39:19,152 --> 00:39:21,834
Men are disgusting.

556
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,170
I know, they really are disgusting.

557
00:39:24,206 --> 00:39:25,483
Yeah.

558
00:39:29,965 --> 00:39:31,012
Really?

559
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:32,258
Do you want to try it?

560
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,089
No, I'm still a virgin.

561
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:36,098
Come on. It feels really good.

562
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,433
Told you, she likes it.

563
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,584
Wing Chun, you should try it too.

564
00:39:56,038 --> 00:39:57,183
No.

565
00:39:57,573 --> 00:39:58,882
Try it.

566
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:01,668
You'll love it.

567
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:18,296
The bandits are causing
trouble in our village.

568
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:20,507
Our lives and properties are in danger.

569
00:40:20,576 --> 00:40:23,510
I suggest that
all able bodied men join forces...

570
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,658
Mr. Leung, you should be in bed.

571
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:32,795
I'm much better already.
I'm just feeling a little down.

572
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:35,835
Is something wrong? Please talk to me.

573
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:40,340
We used to be much closer
when we were kids.

574
00:40:40,379 --> 00:40:41,458
When we were kids?

575
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,373
Yes, we used to be like
brother and sister,

576
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,751
we talked about everything.

577
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:48,567
But now you've changed so much.

578
00:40:49,208 --> 00:40:50,549
Why is that, Wing Chun?

579
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,391
Oh, you've mistaken...

580
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,056
We should discipline the bad.

581
00:40:56,438 --> 00:40:57,387
Rapist!

582
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:58,418
Horny bastard!

583
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,459
How dare you push me?

584
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:04,819
A gentleman does not reason
with his fist.

585
00:41:04,852 --> 00:41:06,258
Fine, then I'll use my mouth.

586
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,936
A gentleman does not reason
with his fist or mouth.

587
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,603
Then I'll use my foot.

588
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:16,911
This isn't the behavior
of a gentleman either.

589
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:20,362
Stop it.
Meet me in the backyard tonight.

590
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,807
I'll explain everything.

591
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:23,722
Please go.

592
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:24,521
Be careful.

593
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,697
You don't even know where he's from.

594
00:41:27,502 --> 00:41:29,891
Just go.

595
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:35,050
You'd better go now
before my men kill you.

596
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,107
Am I right, Charmy?

597
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,870
Charmy has fallen for another man.

598
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:42,117
She's dumping you.

599
00:41:42,186 --> 00:41:43,430
I feel sorry for you.

600
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:45,767
I just care about Charmy.

601
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:47,459
I'm not in love with her.

602
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:50,278
Stop pretending.
You and I are the same.

603
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:54,150
Greedy and cheap.

604
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:57,057
I'm better than Leung Pok To.
I can't lose to him!

605
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:58,370
Let me help you.

606
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,577
You're such a friend!

607
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:03,707
Are you helping me for free?

608
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,115
100 taels.

609
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:05,887
Wow!

610
00:42:06,212 --> 00:42:08,994
That's the price for a gentleman,
but for you...

611
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,172
10% discount.

612
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:12,540
You guarantee I'll bed her?

613
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:14,333
Guarantee you'll have
children with her.

614
00:42:14,913 --> 00:42:16,255
Okay, we have a deal.

615
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:18,138
Give me my change.

616
00:42:18,337 --> 00:42:19,930
I owe you 10 taels.

617
00:42:20,576 --> 00:42:22,648
They have a date tonight

618
00:42:22,687 --> 00:42:23,734
in her room.

619
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:24,952
If you show up earlier,

620
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:26,779
you'll be able to...

621
00:42:27,423 --> 00:42:28,797
That's immoral.

622
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,299
Which room?

623
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,656
The one in the middle. Have fun!

624
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:45,143
We both want money and sex.

625
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:54,069
Wing Chun will be out of town
for two days

626
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:55,794
Really? Are you sure?

627
00:42:55,863 --> 00:42:56,659
Here she comes.

628
00:43:05,013 --> 00:43:06,638
Tell 2nd Fortress Lord
that we can get Charmy tonight.

629
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:07,307
Okay.

630
00:43:07,348 --> 00:43:08,013
Okay.

631
00:43:33,261 --> 00:43:34,505
Here I am, Charmy!
