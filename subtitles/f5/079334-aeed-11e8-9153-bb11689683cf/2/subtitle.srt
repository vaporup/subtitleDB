1
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,300
Flying Monkey, you want to get Charmy?

2
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,827
Did you get my permission?

3
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,057
Incredible! I'm exhausted.

4
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:11,615
I can't believe she gave me
such a valuable gift.

5
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,783
Too bad, she smelled like
stinky tofu tonight.

6
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,230
Anyway, it's still very special.

7
00:03:24,895 --> 00:03:27,742
This old shoe is yours in exchange
for your token of love.

8
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,824
The shoe is for me.

9
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,289
You can't just take it.

10
00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:44,532
Why is he here?

11
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:51,344
I've received the symbol of our love.

12
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:52,813
You're too late!

13
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:02,964
Another one?

14
00:04:02,998 --> 00:04:04,557
I don't want a used woman!

15
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,707
I've taught Flying Monkey a lesson.

16
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:07,882
Here's a towel.

17
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,714
Thank you.

18
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:23,312
Bitch, come out!

19
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:26,020
Come out, bitch!

20
00:04:26,063 --> 00:04:27,012
What's the matter?

21
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:30,857
You two!

22
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,687
Adulterous couple, come out here!

23
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,200
How dare you treat me like this?

24
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,545
What have I done?

25
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,054
You were just with
Scholar Wong and then him.

26
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,195
Now you've asked me to come here,
you whore!

27
00:04:50,026 --> 00:04:52,480
He's talking to you.

28
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,363
I was not with him.

29
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,370
Don't deny it.
I saw him taking off your clothes.

30
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:01,345
He didn't take off my clothes.

31
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:02,531
Don't lie to me.

32
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:04,223
I saw you naked.

33
00:05:08,869 --> 00:05:10,974
You can't stop me
from revealing the truth.

34
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,209
Yim Wing Chun,
ever since you left Fook Chow

35
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,395
I've been thinking about you.

36
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:19,959
I've traveled so far to see you.

37
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:22,528
I'm so stupid!

38
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,475
You are stupid.

39
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:26,717
I didn't take off my clothes,
she did.

40
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,607
Shame!!!

41
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:42,905
Leung Pok To,
you're as dumb as a pig.

42
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,630
You've misunderstood, she is...

43
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,683
Don't say it.

44
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:50,168
I know, she's a woman.

45
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,435
I'm sorry...

46
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,153
Sorry...

47
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:04,628
Are you alright?

48
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,481
Did that silly guy hurt you?

49
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,484
I'm talking about her heart,
not her body.

50
00:06:09,877 --> 00:06:12,527
Why didn't you tell him
that you are Yim Wing Chun?

51
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,034
What's the use?

52
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:17,135
He does not love the real
Yim Wing Chun.

53
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:43,492
You are all useless fools. Can't you
even protect the 2nd Fortress Lord?

54
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,545
What happened to your pecker?

55
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:15,421
I guess you can't fool around anymore.

56
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:23,362
From now on,
you can concentrate on kung-fu.

57
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,672
Am I right?

58
00:07:24,707 --> 00:07:26,616
Of course, you're right.

59
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,681
Who did this to you?

60
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:34,687
It's a woman called Yim Wing Chun.

61
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:41,142
I'll take revenge for you.

62
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,875
Useless fools.
Can't even defeat a woman.

63
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,648
The bandits are coming!

64
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:26,092
Calm down,

65
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,624
we're not here to rob you

66
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,041
but to buy wedding gifts.

67
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:30,600
It's on the left.

68
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,144
It's on the right.

69
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:31,656
Left.

70
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:32,429
Right.

71
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,120
2nd Fortress Lord,
which way is the tofu store?

72
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:35,916
How would I know?
I only come here at night.

73
00:08:35,952 --> 00:08:37,163
Now who's leading the way.

74
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:37,931
Go straight!

75
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,563
What's going on?

76
00:08:52,716 --> 00:08:53,577
A party?

77
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:55,400
Bandits...

78
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:00,256
Slow down people!

79
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,607
Are you nuts?

80
00:09:05,417 --> 00:09:08,896
How dare you come in broad daylight?

81
00:09:09,193 --> 00:09:11,558
I'm preparing for my wedding.
Stay away!

82
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,021
Wing Chun, please stay away.

83
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:14,307
He's given us a lot of money.

84
00:09:14,342 --> 00:09:15,587
Yes, he's doing business with us.

85
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,761
We're making big bucks here.
Don't ruin our businesses!

86
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,725
Your wedding?
Whose daughter have you kidnapped?

87
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:23,139
I've come to get Charmy.

88
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:24,252
How dare you!

89
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,578
He's messing with your wooden dummy.

90
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:34,142
Stop.

91
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,424
Stay away!

92
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:08,370
Not bad. My Cotton Belly
could have killed someone else.

93
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:21,712
What do you think?

94
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:25,326
Good kicks, quick and fierce

95
00:10:25,557 --> 00:10:26,985
but my hands are faster

96
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,468
I blocked them all.

97
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:30,698
So you are Yim Wing Chun.

98
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,601
Who are you?

99
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:34,927
I'm Flying Chimpanzee.

100
00:10:35,378 --> 00:10:36,556
Another beast!

101
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:39,692
I was the one who wounded the Monkey.
Come and get me.

102
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:40,876
Go ahead.

103
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,118
You are really gorgeous.
I must have you.

104
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:10,026
Are you married?

105
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:10,919
Cut the bull!

106
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:14,406
You're right,
not everyone can tame a wild horse.

107
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:55,963
How about a kiss?

108
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:25,011
Let me go!

109
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:27,309
Help me, Wing Chun.

110
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,528
If you get any closer,
I'll kill her.

111
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:29,937
We'll fight again tomorrow.

112
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,631
If you win, I'll let her go.

113
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,196
But if you lose,

114
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:35,372
you'll be my wife. Let's go.

115
00:12:35,957 --> 00:12:38,029
Wing Chun, help me!

116
00:12:39,891 --> 00:12:41,614
How dare they take
Charmy from Wing Chun.

117
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:42,893
Look, she's fuming.

118
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:51,694
Please come again!

119
00:12:55,056 --> 00:12:56,070
Help!

120
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,035
Wing Chun.

121
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,274
Wing Chun...

122
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,510
Leung Pok To, help me.

123
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,565
Stop him.

124
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:56,310
Whirling kick!

125
00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:11,958
See you tomorrow at the fortress.

126
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,442
Mr. Leung, Mr. Leung!

127
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:19,577
Pok To, Pok To!

128
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:43,666
Pok To, help me catch a cricket.

129
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,431
No problem.

130
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,475
Wing Chun, hurry up.

131
00:14:51,410 --> 00:15:00,748
Wing Chun...

132
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:09,925
Hey, he's calling you.

133
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,130
Wing Chun!

134
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:14,343
Can't you hear him calling you?

135
00:15:15,757 --> 00:15:18,658
He's not calling.
He's just talking in his sleep.

136
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,134
Are you crazy?

137
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:23,105
Why did you give the
Nine Magic Pill to Leung Pok To?

138
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,671
Our master gave it to both of us.

139
00:15:25,706 --> 00:15:27,397
Half of it should be mine.

140
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:29,734
That pill is worth at least 200 taels.

141
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,589
He belongs to someone else.

142
00:15:31,624 --> 00:15:33,282
Why did you save him?

143
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,107
You're out of your mind!

144
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,256
I've got to save Charmy.

145
00:15:36,295 --> 00:15:38,367
But she's your enemy now.

146
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:43,392
Charmy and I are still friends.

147
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,682
It's not her fault.
It's a misunderstanding.

148
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,689
Maybe that's fate.

149
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,440
Even if I am single all my life,

150
00:15:53,475 --> 00:15:55,100
I still have my pride.

151
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:01,982
Besides you'll still be here
to keep me company.

152
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:11,421
I've finally found my love.

153
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,397
Didn't you say that
all men are disgusting?

154
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:22,198
But it's more disgusting
and miserable to be alone.

155
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:24,468
I'm sorry.

156
00:16:26,938 --> 00:16:28,017
Congratulations.

157
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:32,280
Wing Chun. Please don't go.

158
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:33,935
Wing Chun.

159
00:16:37,624 --> 00:16:38,703
You...

160
00:16:38,743 --> 00:16:40,151
Why did you get up so early?

161
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:42,419
Did you know
you've just eaten 200 taels?

162
00:16:42,455 --> 00:16:43,469
I know...

163
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,819
Where are the bandits?

164
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:46,640
10 miles from the
west of the Tai Sin Peak.

165
00:16:47,701 --> 00:16:50,766
Hey, be careful!
There is no more magic pill.

166
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,286
Go back. You haven't recovered.

167
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,618
I will go to the fortress
to rescue Wing Chun.

168
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,276
I'll tell her that
you wanted to come.

169
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,872
No, let's go together.

170
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,518
Sorry for embarrassing you
the other day.

171
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:31,266
Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

172
00:17:31,914 --> 00:17:32,644
Okay.

173
00:17:33,578 --> 00:17:36,392
She seems a little different.

174
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,941
She is not the Wing Chun I remember.

175
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:46,846
Since you two are good friends,

176
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:49,406
you must have known
about the forced marriage.

177
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,556
When Wing Chun was 17,

178
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,332
the villagers called her
the Tofu Beauty.

179
00:17:54,564 --> 00:17:58,274
However, a villain laid eyes on her
and forced her to marry him.

180
00:17:58,756 --> 00:18:00,959
She didn't want to marry him,

181
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,809
so she asked
a top kung-fu master to help her.

182
00:18:04,098 --> 00:18:07,839
The Master said she could avoid
the marriage by learning kung-fu,

183
00:18:07,969 --> 00:18:11,929
but that would scare
other men away as well.

184
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:17,151
Finally, she learned kung-fu
and drove the villain away.

185
00:18:19,262 --> 00:18:22,807
Life can be changed by
just one decision,

186
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:26,168
but Wing Chun has no regrets.

187
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:31,122
Something wrong?

188
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,866
You seem to be telling your own story.

189
00:18:35,066 --> 00:18:36,757
Wing Chun is my best friend,

190
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:38,481
she tells me everything.

191
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,380
Did she tell you about the crickets that
we caught together when we were kids?

192
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:49,042
She is not Wing Chun, you...

193
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,452
Don't worry about who she is.

194
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,072
She is beautiful and very fond of you.

195
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,371
You seem to like her too,
so why don't you accept her?

196
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,499
Do you know? You are my Wing Chun.

197
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,880
I'm not.

198
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,089
You're Wing Chun.

199
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,024
I'm not.

200
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:03,788
You are.

201
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:04,753
I'm not.

202
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:05,320
You are.

203
00:19:05,362 --> 00:19:05,930
I'm not!!!

204
00:19:07,634 --> 00:19:09,357
You're Wing Chun!!!

205
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,943
Okay, I am. Are you alright?

206
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:14,831
I am just over joyed.

207
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,681
I've finally found you.

208
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,210
It was worth the pain.

209
00:19:25,326 --> 00:19:26,951
The newlyweds are here.

210
00:19:28,365 --> 00:19:29,674
Thanks.

211
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,327
Congratulations...

212
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,343
Hurry up.

213
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:39,393
Congratulations.

214
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:40,480
All the best.

215
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,567
Come, my wife.

216
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:56,799
May we ask how
the bride and groom met?

217
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:59,873
Everyone knows I kidnapped her.

218
00:20:02,116 --> 00:20:04,221
The bride and groom should kiss.

219
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,070
Why did you hit me?

220
00:20:15,137 --> 00:20:16,249
I can't stand it.

221
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:23,288
I didn't do anything.

222
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,879
Let's go on with the wedding ceremony.

223
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,288
Let's kowtow.

224
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:32,601
Alright, go to bed.

225
00:20:43,353 --> 00:20:44,248
Stop.

226
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:54,003
The bananas are crushed.
This means you will have many children.

227
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,259
My pecker is missing.

228
00:21:05,301 --> 00:21:07,023
How can I have children?

229
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:12,844
It's alright,
at least your wish is granted.

230
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:16,910
Brother, let me help you do it.

231
00:21:18,097 --> 00:21:19,504
My pecker is willing to help.

232
00:21:19,537 --> 00:21:20,202
Come on,

233
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:23,949
I haven't touched
woman for two years.

234
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:33,192
Listen...

235
00:21:35,277 --> 00:21:37,698
This woman is the bait
to trap Yim Wing Chun.

236
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:41,064
I'm the only man
who can control this wild woman.

237
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:43,659
Don't you want to see
your big brother get laid?

238
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:45,990
Big brother, what about me?

239
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:48,392
Shut up, go drink
with the rest of your brothers...

240
00:21:48,425 --> 00:21:49,287
Dinner time.

241
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,552
He's sleeping with his eyes open.

242
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,176
Look at you.

243
00:22:42,524 --> 00:22:43,385
Who hit my wife?

244
00:22:44,219 --> 00:22:45,167
Go back to sleep.

245
00:22:50,489 --> 00:22:54,199
I'm so drunk.
I can see the scarecrows moving.

246
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:55,792
Cheers.

247
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:00,021
Wake up.

248
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,606
Yim Wing Chun,
I'm the only one in the fortress

249
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:09,391
who can't drink or sleep.

250
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,632
It's all your fault. Get her.

251
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:13,004
Let's go.

252
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:26,094
Go rescue Charmy.

253
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:28,358
Okay.

254
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:16,476
Are you alright?

255
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:19,392
I'm fine.

256
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,297
Go

257
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:30,037
You're early.

258
00:24:31,072 --> 00:24:31,966
Wing Chun.

259
00:24:32,576 --> 00:24:33,590
Pok To.

260
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:38,614
You damn Chimpanzee, let her go.

261
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,859
Charmy, don't be afraid.

262
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:41,363
I don't want her even
if you give her to me.

263
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,225
Are you alright?

264
00:24:43,294 --> 00:24:44,024
I'm fine.

265
00:24:45,405 --> 00:24:46,135
And yourself.

266
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:47,193
Okay.

267
00:24:48,669 --> 00:24:49,595
You can leave first.

268
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:53,906
Wait.

269
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:55,571
Bring me the Champion Spear.

270
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:18,795
If you can get the spear out with
three moves, then I'll release her.

271
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,330
If you can't get it out,

272
00:25:20,724 --> 00:25:22,698
then you'll have to stay with me.

273
00:25:23,412 --> 00:25:24,753
Okay. You got a deal.

274
00:25:48,301 --> 00:25:50,984
The spear is under my feet,
come and get it.

275
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,197
I'll be very gentle.

276
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:53,866
Shut up.

277
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:38,650
You are a bit slow.

278
00:26:39,489 --> 00:26:42,619
But if you surrender now,
I'll let them go.

279
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,821
I haven't even started.

280
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:48,243
Just wait till I beat you.

281
00:26:55,709 --> 00:26:56,504
I like it.

282
00:27:28,116 --> 00:27:30,220
Come and stop me.

283
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,489
I'll push it into the wall,
let's see how you can pull it out.

284
00:27:33,939 --> 00:27:35,051
Thank you very much.

285
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,574
Bravo!

286
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:52,742
Shut up, are you happy that I lost?

287
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,356
Great, this is getting more
and more interesting.

288
00:27:56,397 --> 00:27:57,826
I enjoy fighting with you.

289
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,395
We'll fight again in three days!

290
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:00,002
Let them go!

291
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:00,644
Yes!

292
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,624
Wing Chun, thank you.

293
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:15,685
Wing Chun.

294
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,821
Wing Chun, are you okay?

295
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:25,375
Not quite.

296
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:27,618
Where are you going?

297
00:28:27,846 --> 00:28:28,957
To see my Master.

298
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,204
Will she be okay?

299
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:42,430
You've eaten my Nine Magic Pill,

300
00:28:42,498 --> 00:28:44,385
you should be alright.

301
00:28:49,056 --> 00:28:49,852
Master.

302
00:28:57,117 --> 00:29:02,233
Teeth is stronger than the tongue,
but gentler than steel.

303
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,452
Not strong enough, not gentle enough,
how can I defeat the Chimpanzee?

304
00:29:21,688 --> 00:29:25,070
Even a tall tree has to
return to its origin.

305
00:29:27,318 --> 00:29:31,310
Wing Chun, go and get married.

306
00:29:44,818 --> 00:29:45,745
The owner is on some
personal business.

307
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,152
Closed for the day.

308
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:50,288
Has Wing Chun become Mrs. Fortress?

309
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:55,246
We can't have sweet tofu anymore.

310
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,012
You'll be cross-eyed
if you continue to stare like that.

311
00:29:59,054 --> 00:30:01,225
Charmy...

312
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:02,406
Charmy!

313
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:06,337
Relax, you're out of breath.

314
00:30:06,924 --> 00:30:07,851
Go to hell.

315
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,935
Charmy, why didn't you tell me
you were back? Who do you think I am?

316
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,018
Have you lost your...?

317
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,959
She lost her virginity long time ago.

318
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,173
It doesn't make any difference.

319
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:23,424
The bandits just used me
to bait Wing Chun into their trap.

320
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:37,659
I believe you,
but the villagers don't.

321
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,921
We should get married secretly.

322
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,199
Why don't you move in
with me first.

323
00:30:43,236 --> 00:30:46,366
We will have our wedding
after the rumors are gone.

324
00:30:48,483 --> 00:30:50,586
Charmy is going to marry
Wong Hok Chow!!

325
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,256
Marriage can't be forced.

326
00:30:53,921 --> 00:30:56,221
You've seen what happened
the other night.

327
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,972
Charmy and I have became
husband and wife.

328
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,861
Here's your token of love to me.

329
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:06,140
I don't have such precious stuff.

330
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:06,968
Look.

331
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:07,960
My old shoe!

332
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:13,842
I've waited for your proposal
for a long time.

333
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,258
It's you?

334
00:31:16,763 --> 00:31:20,024
Give me back my chastity!!

335
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:22,578
I'll kill myself.

336
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:26,254
What's done cannot be undone.
Don't worry,

337
00:31:26,328 --> 00:31:28,051
I'll take good care of you.

338
00:31:36,022 --> 00:31:37,680
Is he alright?

339
00:31:37,718 --> 00:31:39,440
He's adding up my wealth.

340
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,158
I didn't know you are so wealthy.

341
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:44,203
What's done cannot be undone.

342
00:31:44,244 --> 00:31:45,804
I'll marry you.

343
00:31:46,035 --> 00:31:47,758
Then I'll marry you, too.

344
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,640
Do you know how much he has?

345
00:31:50,673 --> 00:31:51,917
Of course I do.

346
00:31:51,986 --> 00:31:54,222
Congratulations.

347
00:31:54,258 --> 00:31:55,850
Thank you...

348
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:56,903
Leung Pok To!

349
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:59,430
Who is Leung Pok To?

350
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:00,875
I am.

351
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,985
I have a message from Wing Chun.

352
00:32:03,439 --> 00:32:06,155
I'm very thirsty.

353
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,750
Can I get some sweet tofu.

354
00:32:07,822 --> 00:32:09,163
No problem. Please sit down.

355
00:32:32,776 --> 00:32:36,320
Wing Chun, you're so cruel.

356
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:38,147
Why are you reading my letter?
Give it back.

357
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:39,261
This is mine.

358
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:41,951
How can you leave me?

359
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,548
I thought you have a letter for me?

360
00:32:43,813 --> 00:32:46,398
Yeah, but it's a message.

361
00:32:49,027 --> 00:32:50,936
Look at him I am glad I have you.

362
00:32:54,658 --> 00:32:58,203
How is that? Isn't the message
sweeter than the soy bean milk?

363
00:32:58,241 --> 00:32:59,103
Yes.

364
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,811
I've packed your clothes.

365
00:33:14,237 --> 00:33:16,603
I've also packed for Wing Chun.

366
00:33:16,924 --> 00:33:17,721
Thank you.

367
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:22,038
I've made this for you.

368
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,384
Thank you. It's pretty.

369
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:32,536
Clothes are better when new,
but relationships are better when old.

370
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:36,050
I wish you and Wing Chun happiness.

371
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:56,817
He has probably chosen
to be with Charmy.

372
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,999
He's not coming, I should leave.

373
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:22,244
Oh, you're here already?

374
00:34:22,412 --> 00:34:23,786
Why did you hide in the tree?

375
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,184
I was afraid I'd be late,
so I got here last night.

376
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,224
I just woke up and here you are.

377
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:30,405
You are always so silly.

378
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,485
Let's go.

379
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:41,886
Not feeling well?

380
00:34:42,152 --> 00:34:43,078
Let me help you.

381
00:34:45,287 --> 00:34:47,621
May we borrow your place
to rest for awhile?

382
00:34:47,654 --> 00:34:50,436
Certainly, I am going to pick
some tea leaves.

383
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:52,191
Make yourselves comfortable.

384
00:34:52,228 --> 00:34:52,959
Thank you.

385
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:55,066
Are you alright?

386
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:59,003
Let's rest for awhile.

387
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:03,707
I'm still a bit jittery
after taking the magic pill.

388
00:35:04,257 --> 00:35:05,533
Or is it because of me?

389
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:06,430
Don't tease me?

390
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:07,479
No, no.

391
00:35:32,059 --> 00:35:32,887
Mosquitoes.

392
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:38,062
Ouch.

393
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,520
Let's see how far you can fly.

394
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,093
Now I understand what my master said.

395
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:53,970
Use Wing Chun to redirect the force
of the Chimpanzee's cotton belly.

396
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:56,714
Let's fight the Chimpanzee again.

397
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:58,826
No, it'll be my loss if you lose.

398
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:00,910
How can that be? I...

399
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:03,018
Unless we get married first.

400
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:08,432
Your knees are hurting me.

401
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,086
It really hurts.

402
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,503
You deserve it.

403
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:13,417
It's a natural reflex.

404
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:16,077
Pull it out if you can.

405
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,162
I also have a good one.

406
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,128
No... don't tickle me.

407
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:35,199
You tricked me.

408
00:36:42,217 --> 00:36:44,998
Don't worry. I'll be back soon.

409
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,509
Shout if you need me,
I'll rush right in.

410
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:58,753
Wing Chun.

411
00:37:00,197 --> 00:37:01,854
Kick his ass!

412
00:37:31,836 --> 00:37:34,934
No one can ever escape from me.

413
00:37:36,443 --> 00:37:39,606
If you want a lesson,
I'll grant you one.

414
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:41,811
What if you lose?

415
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,672
I'll call you mom.

416
00:37:43,738 --> 00:37:45,559
Great. My good son.

417
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:46,705
How dare you?

418
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:48,694
Choose your weapon.

419
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:50,386
Eight Chop Swords.

420
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,596
Your short swords
can't compare with my spear.

421
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:01,393
You'll definitely be my wife.

422
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,154
I don't think so.

423
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,812
But, you can be my son.

424
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,407
The longer the stronger.

425
00:39:28,351 --> 00:39:30,107
The shorter the riskier.

426
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,683
It's no use
to have a long weapon.

427
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:06,386
Stop. Move aside.
It's between me and her.

428
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,313
Wing Chun Fist.

429
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:45,185
I'll give you a ride.

430
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:51,457
One more.

431
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,352
Your kung-fu has improved a lot
in the past few days.

432
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:06,910
You haven't seen anything yet.

433
00:41:16,452 --> 00:41:17,400
Cotton Belly!!!

434
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:39,452
Kick you belly open.

435
00:42:05,144 --> 00:42:06,518
Redirect Force.

436
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,708
I have destroyed your Cotton Belly.

437
00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:17,898
I guess you should call me mom.

438
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:23,473
More Wing Chun Fist.

439
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:29,711
Call me mom.

440
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:33,285
One more kick.

441
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:34,412
Again.

442
00:42:47,694 --> 00:42:49,732
Not bad, you're really persistent.

443
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:09,922
I'm not fighting anymore,
my hands are numb.

444
00:43:15,366 --> 00:43:17,406
Fortress Lord, are you okay?

445
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,714
How are you feeling?

446
00:43:32,034 --> 00:43:32,961
You asshole!

447
00:43:32,993 --> 00:43:35,513
How can you attack from behind?

448
00:43:35,552 --> 00:43:37,145
Say sorry to your mom.

449
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:40,061
Big brother, you...

450
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,272
Say it.

451
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,789
Mom, I'm sorry.

452
00:43:46,078 --> 00:43:47,639
Mom, am I right?

453
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,784
Yes, good son.

454
00:43:49,822 --> 00:43:53,116
Farewell, mother of thieves.

455
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,929
Farewell, be good.

456
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,136
Yes, mother of thieves.

457
00:44:12,791 --> 00:44:16,752
Wing Chun...

458
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:21,842
I'm thrilled. I'm very happy.

459
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,337
Get up. Let's go.

460
00:44:24,373 --> 00:44:25,518
I am so happy.

461
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:27,305
Do you know how worried I was?

462
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:29,170
But I knew you would win.

463
00:44:29,203 --> 00:44:30,545
When can we get married?

464
00:44:30,611 --> 00:44:32,236
Let's celebrate with the others.

465
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,694
Thank you...

466
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:40,907
Never thought that we could
sell all our leftover goods.

467
00:44:40,976 --> 00:44:44,010
Yes, the buyers gave us a good deal.

468
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:47,752
Thank you...

469
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:50,664
Charmy, you should settle down, too.

470
00:44:50,702 --> 00:44:53,833
Don't worry, I won't work
at your tofu shop for life.

471
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:06,921
You're a lady, remember?

472
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:08,832
Thank you...

473
00:45:12,968 --> 00:45:14,659
Congratulations...

474
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:17,029
The two of you are made for
each other.

475
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,721
I wish you both a peaceful life.

476
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:20,188
Thank you.

477
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:29,183
Wing Chun I wish you
both the very best.

478
00:45:29,925 --> 00:45:33,240
When have you become
such a smooth talker?

479
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:38,361
I am nice because
I have a happy marriage.

480
00:45:38,722 --> 00:45:41,569
It's almost the lucky hour,
you should get going.

481
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,673
Yes, if we miss the lucky hour...

482
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:45,916
Yes, hurry up.

483
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:47,255
Let's go.

484
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,894
Thank you.
