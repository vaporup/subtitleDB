1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,320
After the conquest and plundering
of the Inca empire by Spain...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,720
...the Indians invented the
legend of El Dorado...

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,740
...a land of gold, located in the
swamps of the Amazon headwaters.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,600
A large expedition of Spanish
adventurers, led by Gonzalo Pizarro...

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,140
...set off from the Peruvian
highlands in late 1560.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,140
The only document to survive
from this lost expedition...

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,980
... is the diary of the monk
Gaspar de Carvajal.

8
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,170
On Christmas day 1560, we reached
the last pass of the Andes...

9
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:11,170
...and for the first time looked
down at the legendary jungle.

10
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,250
In the morning I read mass, then we
descended through the clouds.

11
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,660
AGUIRRE,
THE WRATH OF GOD

12
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,020
A film by
Werner Herzog

13
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,540
No one can get down that river alive !

14
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,180
I tell you, we can do it!

15
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,660
From here it will be easier.

16
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,820
No. We're all going to go under.

17
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,860
Our Indian slaves are useless.

18
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,940
The changing climate
kills them off like flies...

19
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,500
...most of them die of colds.

20
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,140
We don't even have time to
give them a Christian burial.

21
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,380
Come on, move it!

22
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,740
Move you pigs!
Come on! Let's go !

23
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,620
Keep moving, we don't want
to get stuck in the mud!

24
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,060
Son of a bitch!

25
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,740
You idiots!
The sedan-chair will get stuck!

26
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
This way!

27
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,100
Damned mud!

28
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,260
Watch it, you idiots!

29
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,780
Keep the barrel out of the water!

30
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,940
By the last day of the year,
we were exhausted.

31
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,860
We camped near the river.

32
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,660
It can't go on like this, men.

33
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,820
The rations are almost finished.

34
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,060
The terrain is so difficult,
we're almost at a standstill.

35
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,100
We cannot hope to reach a
populated area for some time.

36
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,260
In view of the situation we're in...

37
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,980
... I have changed my plans...

38
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,060
...as follows:

39
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,420
Rafts will be built
and manned by forty men.

40
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,780
These men will have the task...

41
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,860
...to get food and information
about hostile Indians...

42
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,780
...and the location of El Dorado.

43
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,580
We have every reason to
believe that both are near...

44
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,260
The expedition must return
within one week...

45
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,500
... by water or by land.

46
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,060
If it doesn't...

47
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,980
...we have to assume it is lost...

48
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,860
...and we have to march back
the same way...

49
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,180
... in the hope of reaching an area
inhabited by Christians.

50
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,220
We hope, of course,
that this will not happen...

51
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,620
...as long as the Virgin Mary
is with us.

52
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,740
After careful consideration,
I have decided...

53
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,780
...to make Don Pedro de Ursua
commander of the expedition.

54
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,300
His mistress, Dona Inez de Atienza,
will accompany him.

55
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,420
This happens against my
better judgement.

56
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:31,300
But she expressed her wish with
such grace and firmness...

57
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,980
...that I cannot refuse it.

58
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,220
Don Lope de Aguirre will be
second in command.

59
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,940
A man who is well qualified
for this task.

60
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,420
His daughter Flores will stay
under his protection...

61
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,860
...this also is against
my better judgement.

62
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,620
At fifteen, she should have stayed
in the care of the Holy Sisters.

63
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,500
As on all expeditions, the word of
God must be brought to the pagans.

64
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,820
I hereby nominate Brother
Gaspar de Carvajal for this task.

65
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,780
The remaining two hundred slaves
will stay with my group.

66
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,460
The Royal House of Spain
will be represented...

67
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,700
... by the brave nobleman,
Don Fernando de Guzman...

68
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,020
...who proved his courage
10 years ago...

69
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,100
...at the storming of the fortress
of Sax ahuaman.

70
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,580
Some of the best warriors will
form this group...

71
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,500
... but those not chosen
shouldn't feel rejected.

72
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,380
I declare all this in the
form of a document...

73
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:47,100
...to be submitted for approval
to the Council of the Indies.

74
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,100
Herewith I append my signature.

75
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,260
Four days later, on January fourth,
we set out.

76
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,180
May God be with us.

77
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,420
Watch the raft,
the rapids get stronger!

78
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,340
Keep in the middle of the river!

79
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,700
- The first raft got stuck in an eddy!
- They must get away from the rocks!

80
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,620
January Sixth.

81
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,140
We finally reached shore
and set up camp.

82
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,180
On the other side of the river,
one of our rafts ran into an eddy.

83
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:06,500
We could not hear what they
were yelling, and could not help.

84
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,620
How many are on the raft?

85
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,620
Seven and two Indians.

86
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,820
We must try to help
the poor devils, Aguirre.

87
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,820
You are crazy!

88
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,020
We will not help them!

89
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,180
I'm still giving the orders.

90
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,180
Is that so...

91
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,700
We need long ropes and hooks.
Further downstream we can cross.

92
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,260
Once we're on the other side,
we'll be able to get them out.

93
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,900
Take as many men as
you need... and hurry!

94
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,770
I wonder if Armando has
reached the other side?

95
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,610
Those men must be getting sick.
They're still going around in circles.

96
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,090
- What is this?
- They're firing over there.

97
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,130
They're trying to signal us.

98
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,690
Maybe it's a battle?

99
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,090
There are only six.

100
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,250
The oarsmen and the
seventh man have gone.

101
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,970
I find that strange.

102
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,010
Look, the oars are still there.

103
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,010
I'm sure, there are still
some Indians in this area.

104
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,290
We better go back to the camp.

105
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,570
Keep your eyes open!

106
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,650
Help!

107
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,730
Indians! Indians!

108
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:04,690
A prayer from here is not enough,
Brother Carvajal.

109
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,970
I want to take these men
back for a Christian burial.

110
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,170
You are right, my son...

111
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,970
...their souls will rest much better
in consecrated ground.

112
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,370
It's the least we can do for these
poor guys who died so bravely.

113
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,290
Perucho !

114
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,450
Perucho, don't you think the
cannon is getting a bit rusty?

115
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,210
Perhaps.

116
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,610
You know very well
who is responsible.

117
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,370
If Aguirre gets away with this,
who knows what he'll do next?

118
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,890
Don't worry about that.

119
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,650
We really have other problems.

120
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,410
There are Indians everywhere.

121
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,370
The whole area is full of them...

122
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,050
...and no one wants to die
like the men on the raft.

123
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,930
If only we were out of this trouble...

124
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,610
We can't hope for that yet.

125
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,890
Don't be afraid.

126
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:31,050
Aguirre would never dare to rebel
against the Spanish crown.

127
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,530
We are not in Castile, here.

128
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,610
Look what I've found for you.

129
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,570
This animal sleeps its
whole life away.

130
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,130
It's never really awake.

131
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:15,730
Our rafts are gone.

132
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,770
The rafts are gone !

133
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,490
January Eighth.

134
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,890
The river rose fifteen feet over night.

135
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,730
When will our misfortunes end?

136
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,530
If I remove your chains,
will you run away?

137
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,250
Would you?

138
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,170
Stop, wait a minute, isn't that my pot?

139
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,090
What are you doing with my pot?

140
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,810
No, the wood is too heavy.

141
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:39,570
We'll take this one. I'm not taking
one step further into this jungle.

142
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,210
What's going on?

143
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,570
We're making nails.

144
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,050
What for?

145
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,770
We need as many nails as possible.

146
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,170
What are you doing with this log?

147
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:05,650
Well, I'm carrying it from where
I found it back to the camp.

148
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:07,410
Who gave that order?

149
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,850
Everyone here is collecting wood.

150
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,650
And iron.

151
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,050
What's going on here?

152
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,650
I have no idea.

153
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,650
Who gave the order to build rafts?

154
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,930
What does it all mean?
Do you know, Inez?

155
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:07,450
Don't even ask.
It's your father's fault.

156
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,610
If only it were all over.

157
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,810
Gentlemen, as your commander,
I have decided...

158
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,050
...to return to our main troop.

159
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:21,690
It's not my habit to retreat.

160
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,490
We have to march back, of course,
because the current is too strong.

161
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,130
We need to get back within the
time Pizarro ordered.

162
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,890
But that would be suicide
because of the Indians.

163
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,610
Whatever the cost,
we have to march back.

164
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,170
We must get back to Pizarro !

165
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,050
Shit on Pizarro !

166
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,810
I say, we can't accomplish
our task this way.

167
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,450
And I say, we can conquer
without Pizarro !

168
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,010
That's what we gathered
logs and iron for...

169
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:56,210
...to build a raft.

170
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:02,570
Do you remember Hernando Cortez?

171
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,770
Bound for Mexico, he was ordered
to return...

172
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,770
... but he just went on!

173
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,010
Silence, Aguirre !

174
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,890
He ignored the orders
and conquered Mexico !

175
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,490
Silence, everyone !

176
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,010
That's how he became
rich and famous...

177
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,210
Be quiet!

178
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,970
Because he disobeyed!

179
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,370
Put him in chains!

180
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,730
Stop it, now!

181
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,890
- I follow Ursua.
- Kill him!

182
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,530
Anyone else?

183
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,810
What do you think will happen now?

184
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,530
What if there are
waterfalls downstream?

185
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:39,730
Who cares, as long as we
get closer to El Dorado.

186
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,610
Have you seen Ursua
clenching his fist?

187
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,930
He must have something in it.

188
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,330
I think, they will kill him.

189
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,690
Would you have the courage
to help him?

190
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,710
You're the only one who can help us.

191
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,910
I know he will kill Ursua
and Armando.

192
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,870
He will finish what he has started.

193
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:00,190
You are my last hope.

194
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:08,430
Thou lettest man flow on like a river...

195
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,030
...and Thy years know no end.

196
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,070
As for man...

197
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,070
... his days are like grass...

198
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:20,870
...as a flower on the field,
so he blossoms.

199
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,790
For when the wind passeth over it...

200
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,230
...and it is gone, and the place
thereof shall know it no more.

201
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,270
You know, my child...

202
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,790
...for the good of our Lord...

203
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,750
...the Church was always
on the side of the strong.

204
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,630
I would like to have you on our side.

205
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,750
We need men like you.

206
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,350
You should think about it...

207
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,310
... but not too long.

208
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,550
Well, gentlemen...

209
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,910
...we've gotten rid of
the troublemakers.

210
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,830
Now we need a leader.

211
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,870
For me, the choice is clear.

212
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:48,710
We should elect the biggest
and strongest nobleman we have.

213
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,710
- What me?
- Yes... you.

214
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,070
Well, gentlemen.

215
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,590
I am making a proposal
to elect Guzmán.

216
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,790
Who else is for him?

217
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:44,790
I propose that Don Lope de Aguirre
remains second-in-command!

218
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,350
Who's in favor?

219
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,020
Plagues have come over my
people, earthquakes and floods...

220
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
... but what the Spaniards did to us...

221
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,420
... is much, much worse.

222
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,140
They gave me the name Balthasar,
but my real name is Runo Rimac.

223
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,020
- What does that mean?
- Runo Rimac.

224
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,620
It means: He who speaks.
I was a prince in this land.

225
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,860
No one was allowed to look
directly into my eyes.

226
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:27,620
But now I'm in chains,
like my people...

227
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,180
...and I must bow my head.

228
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:36,180
Almost everything was taken from us.
I can't do anything, I'm powerless.

229
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,860
But I am also sorry for you...

230
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,820
... because I know there is
no escape from this jungle.

231
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,980
How is Ursua?

232
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,100
Because of our mutiny,
we must make our position legal.

233
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,500
Read this document.

234
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,920
Caesarian King, by the grace of God,
through our Holy Mother...

235
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,600
...the Roman Church,
Philip the Second of Castile.

236
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,760
We, the undersigned,
have until yesterday...

237
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,760
...the seventh day of 1561

238
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,680
... regarded ourselves as your
servants and subjects.

239
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,640
We are now more than 200 miles
from your servant, Gonzalo Pizarro.

240
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,960
Fate, God's help and the work of our
hands have carried us down a river.

241
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,760
A river, the natives call Huallaga,
in search of a new land of gold.

242
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,600
We have decided to put
an end to the quirks of fate.

243
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,560
We are forging history, and no fruits of
this earth shall henceforth be shared.

244
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,920
We rebel until death.

245
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,760
Our hands shall perish and our
tongues dry up if this is not so.

246
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,600
The House of Habsburg
is overthrown.

247
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,480
And you, Philip the Second,
are dethroned.

248
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,080
By dint of this declaration,
be you annihilated.

249
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,240
In your place we proclaim...

250
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,080
...the nobleman from Sevilla,
Don Fernando de Guzmán...

251
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,360
...as Emperor of El Dorado.

252
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,560
Flee from hence, O King!

253
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,480
And may God bless your soul.

254
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,720
Fortune smiles on the brave
and spits on the coward.

255
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,840
Let's sever our ties with Spain and
crown Don Fernando de Guzmán...

256
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
... Emperor of El Dorado.

257
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,160
Do you call this a throne?

258
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:35,320
What is a throne, but a plank
covered with velvet, Your Majesty.

259
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,320
He must have
dragged himself along.

260
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,120
That's no arrow wound,
that was a sword thrust.

261
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,080
He must have tried to stop him.

262
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,640
January Tenth.

263
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,880
Armando escaped from his prison.

264
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,240
The man who went on guard at
three o'clock was murdered.

265
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,440
It was one of his men.
While Ursua is alive...

266
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,920
...you'll never be safe !

267
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,000
What can I do about it?

268
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,560
Kill him.

269
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,680
While I'm Emperor, law will prevail.

270
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,520
No killings without a trial.

271
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,800
Then try him... and then kill him!

272
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,520
But it must me a public trial.

273
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,440
He still has sympathizers.

274
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,800
Perucho, to the witness stand.

275
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,560
What did you get out of Ursua?

276
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Nothing.

277
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,720
Three men couldn't open his fist.
He must have something in it.

278
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,160
We'd have to chop his
hand off to get at it.

279
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,520
He said nothing,
except some nonsense.

280
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,800
But last night he had visitors.

281
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,680
The whole story reeks of conspiracy.

282
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,160
Balthasar, ask him if it's true that
he received money from Ursua.

283
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,520
Yes, it's true.

284
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,360
It was the oarsmen's pay.

285
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,600
Next witness!

286
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,720
Okello, is it true that you also
received money from Ursua?

287
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:34,440
I was Pizarro's slave. Then he
gave me away for this expedition...

288
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,120
... because he thought, if the Indians
are scared of a horse...

289
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,000
...they'd be terrified of a black man.

290
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,360
Well, I don't know why, but
sometimes Ursua gave me money.

291
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,240
What does the defendant
have to say?

292
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,410
I want to speak.

293
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,690
In Spain I had many servants,
and I paid them.

294
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:24,290
It is only fair to give them
money here as well...

295
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,890
...even if they are Indians.

296
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:31,650
Time will tell that Ursua is right.

297
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,930
We understand your confusion,
my child. You are ex cused.

298
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,130
The jury, after having heard
all testimonies...

299
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,410
...finds the defendant...

300
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,650
...guilty of treason.

301
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,130
My unpleasant duty...

302
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,930
...as President of the first court
of your Highness, Don Fernando...

303
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,210
... is to sentence Pedro de Ursua...

304
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:21,410
...to death by hanging.

305
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:26,570
I confirm the verdict.

306
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:30,890
But since it is the anniversary of
the last Moor leaving Spain...

307
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,650
... I will grant clemency.

308
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,090
His life will be spared,
but he forfeits...

309
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,370
...all rights as a citizen of El Dorado.

310
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,290
Half of his shares
will go to the Church...

311
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:47,570
...the other half will be divided
among my best soldiers.

312
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:16,130
January Twelfth.

313
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,610
In the morning we set out
with a new raft.

314
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,090
Ursua is still alive...

315
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,650
...but he refuses to speak.

316
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,370
Look, a fire !

317
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,930
At noon we saw a great fire.

318
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,810
Steer closer to the shore !

319
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,770
Load your muskets.

320
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,050
I can't see anyone.

321
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:44,930
Be careful, men!
It could be an ambush.

322
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,490
Strip the negro, go on!

323
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:02,010
Fearing an ambush, we stripped the
negro slave, to frighten the Indians.

324
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:19,810
Go ! Run!

325
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,690
Go on! Go, I said!

326
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,210
Drive him in front of us!

327
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:46,730
Get away from the food!

328
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,050
Look out for Indians!

329
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,250
Are you crazy?

330
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:56,010
Take your weapons!

331
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:34,770
Look at that. It was one of our men.

332
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,170
Where does this come from?

333
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,530
And this here?

334
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:53,570
For heaven's sake, cannibals!

335
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:10,610
The discovery of cannibals
around us was so disturbing...

336
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:13,290
...that we hastily left
this dreadful place.

337
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,770
January twentieth.

338
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,490
The mountains are now behind us
and the land is flat.

339
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:41,490
The roof Aguirre had us build,
protects us against the scorching sun.

340
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,050
The river is sluggish and we're
slowly coming to a halt.

341
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:13,090
What's this?
Are you giving him a gun?

342
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:01,450
Aguirre, I know that you plan on
doing something to Ursua!

343
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,610
There's no doubt in my mind.

344
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,090
And God will punish you for that!

345
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,690
Get out of my way!

346
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,290
Are you alright, little one?

347
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:05,210
What's happening?
You can't hear a thing.

348
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:54,380
It's suddenly so quiet.

349
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,060
Yes, not a sound.

350
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,460
Shh...so, we can hear...

351
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:21,140
The gunpowder! It's on fire !

352
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,380
Out of the way! It's going to blow up!

353
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:34,060
Grab the pole !

354
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:36,900
Help me pull the Emperor
onto the raft!

355
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,180
Here, so he can hold on to it.

356
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,660
Damned horse...

357
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,460
... nothing but trouble !

358
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,700
What's wrong with him?

359
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:01,620
He's dead.

360
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,620
Look how short the arrow is.

361
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,820
Poisoned.

362
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,740
It must belong to a dwarf.

363
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:15,020
- Fire ! Make some noise, quickly!
- What are we to aim at?

364
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,620
Just shoot, you asshole !

365
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,260
Fire !

366
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,060
Fire !

367
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,930
Come, play something for the men.

368
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,210
- Look, isn't that a canoe?
- Where?

369
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:32,570
Over there under those trees,
it's coming towards us.

370
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:49,010
Keep the raft mid-stream.
It could be a trap.

371
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:59,130
January twenty fourth.

372
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,970
For the first time, we saw
two of the savages.

373
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,810
They seemed to be trusting.

374
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,730
Pull the boat close.

375
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,930
I have the man. Hold him!

376
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,330
And I have the woman.

377
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:16,730
Look, there's a fish!

378
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:52,010
What did he say?

379
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:55,210
He says...

380
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,970
... he's from the Yagua Tribe.

381
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:05,130
He knows from his ancestors
that one day, the Sons of the Sun...

382
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:08,610
...would arrive from afar,
through great perils.

383
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:12,970
The strangers would come with
thunder from tubes.

384
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,730
They've waited a long time for the
coming of the Sons of the Sun.

385
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:20,690
For here on this river,
God never finished His Creation.

386
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,250
Look, gold!
Where did you get that?

387
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,130
Gold!

388
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:39,530
Gold! Ask him where he got it from.

389
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:42,010
Ask him where El Dorado is.

390
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,410
Where does this gold come from?

391
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,450
What did he say?

392
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,490
Has this savage ever heard
of our savior Jesus Christ...

393
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:02,130
...and of our mission and
the True Word of God?

394
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,930
This is a Bible.
It contains the Word of God...

395
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:16,010
...that we preach to bring light
into the darkness of their world.

396
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:22,570
Does he understand at all, that this
book contains the Word of God?

397
00:59:25,610 --> 00:59:27,330
Take it in your hand, my son.

398
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:36,090
- He says, it doesn't talk.
- Kill him for this blasphemy!

399
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,330
It is a tough business.

400
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,970
These savages are hard to convert.

401
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,860
It won't be much longer.

402
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,020
El Dorado might be only
a few days away.

403
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,020
No more rust on the cannon.

404
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,500
We will shoot our enemies
with golden bullets.

405
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,780
And you, Okello, will serve
my food on golden platters.

406
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,020
And all of us will gain something.

407
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,220
Governships...

408
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,900
... provinces...

409
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:36,140
...and women.

410
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,740
And perhaps I'll even be free.

411
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:46,980
Let's not forget the most
important part of our mission...

412
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,860
...to spread the Word of God
to the savages.

413
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,740
I'm sure you'd like a golden cross
studded with jewels, Carvajal...

414
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,860
... instead of the silver one you lost.

415
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:46,580
All the land to our left
and all the land to our right...

416
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,860
... now belongs to us.

417
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:58,420
I solemnly and formally
take possession of all this land.

418
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:25,620
Our country is already six
times larger than Spain...

419
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,540
...and every day we drift,
makes it bigger.

420
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:36,220
Have you seen any solid ground
that would support your weight?

421
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:03,180
Okello, it's missing salt!

422
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:06,860
Fish and fruit we can
find now and then...

423
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,100
... but we've been out of salt
for a while.

424
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,540
We're down to counting our
last grains of corn.

425
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,820
- Hold the horse !
- The horse has cut loose !

426
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,300
- Take the reins!
- Watch out!

427
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:02,780
Watch, that it doesn't jump off board!

428
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:41,700
Damn, get that horse away from me !
Get rid of it!

429
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,020
Throw that damned beast off the raft!

430
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:50,780
Go on!
Go for a swim!

431
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,180
- It wants to get back on board.
- Go away!

432
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,340
I think he's a dead man.

433
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:09,180
In Mexico, I saw an army of Indians
flee at the sight of one single horse.

434
01:07:09,700 --> 01:07:13,980
And besides, we could have
eaten meat for a week...

435
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:41,820
Don't worry, little one,
the horse will be alright.

436
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:54,340
Oh, my God, the Emperor!

437
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:56,860
The Emperor is dead!

438
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:29,900
After our Emperor's death,
the fate of Ursua was sealed.

439
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:35,500
Next morning, a few soldiers took
him away and he never came back.

440
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:36,100
Little mother,

441
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:38,300
...two by two...

442
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,900
...wafts the wind on my hair.

443
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:35,620
What are they shouting?

444
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:39,540
They're shouting,
"Meat is floating by."

445
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,060
Fire !

446
01:12:17,780 --> 01:12:19,740
Set the village on fire !

447
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,860
Keep shooting, it'll scare them!

448
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:32,380
Don't go into the jungle !

449
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,580
Salt!

450
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:44,540
Salt!

451
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,780
I haven't had salt for a month!

452
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:59,990
She has gone without a trace.
We couldn't find her anywhere.

453
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,710
We have not seen any Indians either.

454
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,070
Let's march back to Pizarro.

455
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:09,390
Two men, more or less,
it won't matter to him.

456
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:13,590
I am sick of it. I'm leaving tonight.

457
01:14:13,670 --> 01:14:16,470
If I march at night,
the Indians won't catch me.

458
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:19,790
In the day, I will hide.
I will get back to Pizarro.

459
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:24,270
We followed her tracks half a mile
into the jungle, then we lost them.

460
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:26,390
She simply vanished!

461
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:32,310
Then one of the men panicked
because of the silence...

462
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:35,670
...which always comes just before
someone gets killed.

463
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:41,070
I'd rather join the Indians,
than stay with this madman.

464
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:43,990
That man is a head taller than me.

465
01:14:44,910 --> 01:14:46,710
That may change...

466
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:57,950
I'll explain my plan.
I have counted the river bends.

467
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:01,710
I've drawn a map in the sand.

468
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,910
We need about a day for each bend.

469
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:07,870
One, two...

470
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:10,910
...three, four, five...

471
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,950
...six, seven...

472
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:14,470
...eight...

473
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,550
... nine...

474
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:19,750
...ten.

475
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:25,750
I am the great traitor.
There can be no greater!

476
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:32,790
Whoever even thinks about deserting
will be cut into 198 pieces!

477
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:39,030
And then trampled upon until
you can paint the walls with him.

478
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:47,910
Whoever eats one grain too many...

479
01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:50,270
...or drinks one dr op of water
too much...

480
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:55,510
...will be locked up for 155 years!

481
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:05,430
If l, Aguirre, want the birds
to drop dead from the trees...

482
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,990
...the birds will drop dead
from the trees.

483
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,110
I am the Wrath of God!

484
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,670
The earth I walk upon
sees me and quakes!

485
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:29,830
But whoever follows me
and the river, will win untold riches.

486
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:40,950
But whoever deserts...

487
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:42,950
Get away from the tree !
Go to mid-stream!

488
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:45,870
- Hey, give me a pole !
- Watch out, the roof!

489
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:48,670
Watch out, the sedan-chair is falling!

490
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,110
Careful!

491
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:56,150
Over there.

492
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,630
The long arrows are
getting fashionable...

493
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:05,230
- Indians!
- Where? I don't see any.

494
01:19:05,590 --> 01:19:09,070
- Make noise !
- I better get out of here.

495
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,390
February first.

496
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:38,310
The men's morale is at a low point.
I spoke with Aguirre.

497
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:41,470
Things are not turning out
as we expected.

498
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:45,350
We see nothing but
hunger and death.

499
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:48,590
We lose men,
but we never see the enemy.

500
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:52,830
Even El Dorado hasn't been
more than an illusion.

501
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,830
Mexico was no illusion!

502
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:20,150
If we turn back now,
others will come.

503
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:22,470
And they will succeed!

504
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:27,030
And we'll remain a failure !

505
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:31,310
Even if this land only consists
of trees and water...

506
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:33,550
...we will conquer it!

507
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:39,450
And it'll be milked dry
by those who follow us.

508
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,450
My men measure riches in gold.

509
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:48,750
It is more.

510
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:54,070
It is power and fame.

511
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,190
I despise them for it.

512
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:07,710
I am sure, Aguirre is leading
us into destruction.

513
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,830
I almost feel, he does it deliberately.

514
01:21:11,390 --> 01:21:17,070
We can't even get ashore, since
the river flooded the jungle for miles.

515
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,150
February twenty-second.

516
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:27,510
The suffering is dreadful.

517
01:21:27,910 --> 01:21:31,110
Most men have fever
and hallucinations.

518
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,950
Hardly anyone can stand upright.

519
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:38,670
The soldier Justo Gonzales drank
my ink, thinking it was medicine.

520
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:41,470
I can no longer write.

521
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,950
We are drifting in circles.

522
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:10,870
I see a ship with sails...

523
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,190
... in a tall tree...

524
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:17,830
...and from the stern hangs a canoe.

525
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:25,070
The ship is in your imagination.

526
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:28,270
No floodwaters could rise this high.

527
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:31,950
We all have the fever.

528
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:35,750
It is only a mirage.

529
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:40,940
These things happen when
people are overly exhausted.

530
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:43,020
Shut up, monk!

531
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:47,180
We'll get that ship! It is real!
We'll sail to the Atlantic with it.

532
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:52,260
No, Lope de Aguirre, I won't go
with you. We are weak and hungry.

533
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:09,620
That is no ship. That is no forest.

534
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,380
That is no arrow.

535
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:18,620
We just imagine the arrows,
because we fear them.

536
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,420
These arrows are real, take cover!

537
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,340
This arrow can't harm me.

538
01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:36,140
This is not rain.

539
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:45,140
Monk, do not forget to pray,
lest God's end...

540
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:49,020
...will be uncomely.

541
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,300
When we reach the sea...

542
01:26:04,780 --> 01:26:07,140
...we will build a bigger ship...

543
01:26:07,620 --> 01:26:12,580
...sail north and take Trinidad
from the Spanish crown.

544
01:26:19,660 --> 01:26:22,140
From there we'll sail on...

545
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,420
...and take Mexico from Cortez.

546
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:29,940
What great treachery this will be!

547
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:34,660
Then, all of New Spain
will be in our hands...

548
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:38,140
...and we'll stage history...

549
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:41,620
...like others stage plays.

550
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,580
l, the Wrath of God...

551
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,580
...will marry my own daughter...

552
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:54,700
...and with her I will found
the purest dynasty...

553
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:57,500
...the earth has ever seen.

554
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,780
Together...

555
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:04,100
...we shall rule this entire continent.

556
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,780
We will endure.

557
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:17,620
I am the Wrath of God!

558
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,100
Who else is with me?
