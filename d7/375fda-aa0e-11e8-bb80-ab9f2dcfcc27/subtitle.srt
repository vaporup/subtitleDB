4

6
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:17,357
<i>things seem to be</i>
<i>pretty normal on our</i>
<i>Southland freeways,</i>

7
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:19,402

<i>just about filled to capacity</i>

8
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,071
<i>at this hour of the morning.</i>

9
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,697
<i>There's a report</i>

10

<i>just south of Mulholland.</i>

11
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,245

<i>Both vehicles are now up</i>

<i>Traffic is still slow</i>

16

<i>Ventura Freeway</i>

18

<i>...that the Census</i>
<i>Bureau has sent out</i>

<i>That will be</i>
<i>the basis of this...</i>

<i>Census District Office.</i>

62
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,715
<i>I would like</i>
<i>some information.</i>

63
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:47,716
<i>I'm filling out my</i>
<i>census form right now</i>

64

<i>and I have an awful problem.</i>

65
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:52,305
<i>And I was wondering,</i>
<i>can somebody help me?</i>

66
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:53,790
<i>Go ahead.</i>

67
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,684
<i>Thanks. Oh, you're</i>
<i>gonna answer my question?</i>

68
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:56,808
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Oh, good.</i>

69
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,979
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>I just wanted to say, uh,</i>

70
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,980
<i>I don't mind being</i>
<i>counted as an American.</i>

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,732
<i>I'm one of</i>
<i>the silent majority.</i>

72
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:06,153
<i>But I wish you had</i>
<i>made some of those</i>
<i>questions multiple choice.</i>

73
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:09,573
<i>Now, the question was, um,</i>

74
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:12,155
<i>are you the head</i>
<i>of the family?</i>

75
00:04:12,255 --> 00:04:15,704
<i>Well, quite frankly,</i>
<i>the day I married that woman</i>

76
00:04:15,804 --> 00:04:19,081
<i>that, unfortunately,</i>
<i>I've been married to</i>
<i>for the last 25 years...</i>

77
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,207
<i>Oh!</i>

78
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,877
<i>Well, it's true.</i>

79
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:25,710
<i>Well, I lost the position</i>
<i>as head of the family.</i>

80
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,759
<i>You see, what I do...</i>
<i>I stay home. I hate working.</i>

81
00:04:28,859 --> 00:04:30,427
<i>I hate going out</i>
<i>and seeing people</i>

82
00:04:30,527 --> 00:04:33,178
<i>and getting involved</i>
<i>in the rat race</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

83
00:04:33,278 --> 00:04:35,887
<i>So she works and</i>
<i>I do the housework</i>

84
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:39,393
<i>and take care of the babies</i>
<i>and things like that.</i>

85
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:42,352
<i>And so, I was wondering,</i>
<i>you wanted honest answers.</i>

86
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:45,857
<i>Now, what I did, I</i>
<i>penciled in all of the marks</i>

87
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:49,442
<i>that you wanted marks</i>
<i>in these circles here</i>
<i>that I see in front of me.</i>

88
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,321
<i>I penciled it in first,</i>
<i>but I said,</i>

89
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,447
<i>"No, that's being dishonest.</i>

90
00:04:52,547 --> 00:04:54,280
<i>"I'm really not</i>
<i>the head of the family,</i>

91
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,115
<i>"and yet I'm</i>
<i>the man of the family."</i>

92
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:58,702
<i>Although there are</i>
<i>people in the neighborhood</i>
<i>who would question that.</i>

93
00:04:58,802 --> 00:05:01,456
<i>But nevertheless,</i>
<i>I was wondering,</i>

94
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,668
<i>how should I</i>
<i>answer that question?</i>

95
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,130
<i>Well, if you</i>
<i>don't consider yourself</i>
<i>head of the household,</i>

96
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,587
<i>and you think that your wife</i>
<i>occupies that position,</i>

97
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:12,048
<i>I would suggest you put</i>
<i>your wife's name there.</i>

98
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:13,426
<i>Yes, but</i>
<i>that's so embarrassing.</i>

99
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,679
<i>What will you people</i>
<i>think when I send it?</i>

100
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,262
<i>Nobody is even</i>
<i>going to know.</i>

101
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:18,335
<i>Are you sure?</i>

102
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:20,558
<i>I'm positive.</i>
<i>No one will know about that.</i>

103
00:05:20,658 --> 00:05:22,185
<i>We won't know you</i>
<i>from Adam's house cat.</i>

104
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:24,769
<i>I know.</i>
<i>But there are people</i>
<i>in my neighborhood...</i>

105
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:26,147
<i>They will never</i>
<i>see that form.</i>

106
00:05:26,247 --> 00:05:27,238
<i>Are you sure?</i>

107
00:05:27,338 --> 00:05:30,491
<i>No one</i>
<i>in your neighborhood</i>
<i>will ever find out.</i>

108
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,447
<i>I don't want people</i>
<i>to know about that.</i>

109
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:35,743
<i>Quite frankly, I've</i>
<i>lived like this for 15 years,</i>

110
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:38,118
<i>and I admit,</i>
<i>I wear a house dress.</i>

111
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:41,828
<i>It's so much easier</i>
<i>to pick up stuff</i>
<i>in a house dress,</i>

112
00:05:41,928 --> 00:05:43,500
<i>and, you know, slippers.</i>

113
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,625
<i>And, quite frankly,</i>
<i>I've adopted most...</i>

114
00:05:45,725 --> 00:05:46,697
Talk about pollution.

115
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:48,670
<i>...of the average</i>
<i>housewife,</i>

116
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,298
<i>and I'd hate for</i>
<i>anybody to know that.</i>

117
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,506
<i>Anyway, it's</i>
<i>very embarrassing,</i>
<i>so would you...</i>

118
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:57,847
<i>All information</i>
<i>that you include on</i>
<i>that form is confidential.</i>

119
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,954
<i>...800,000 others.</i>

120
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,745
<i>So it would be all right?</i>
<i>I wanna be honest with you.</i>

121
00:06:21,845 --> 00:06:23,371
<i>I'm really not</i>
<i>the head of the family.</i>

122
00:06:23,471 --> 00:06:24,666
<i>She doesn't know</i>
<i>I'm calling.</i>

123
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:28,124
<i>That woman just</i>
<i>drives me up the wall</i>
<i>and over the other side.</i>

124
00:06:28,224 --> 00:06:30,463
<i>I like doing this just</i>
<i>to get even with her.</i>

125
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,885
<i>You know how women are</i>
<i>before you marry them.</i>
<i>They're so nice.</i>

126
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:41,095
<i>And suddenly they</i>
<i>become so aggressive.</i>

127
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:43,393
<i>I mean, she became so</i>
<i>aggressive afterward.</i>

128
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:45,143
<i>Just took over everything.</i>
<i>I mean...</i>

129
00:06:45,243 --> 00:06:46,563
<i>Oh, no.</i>

130
00:06:46,663 --> 00:06:48,563
<i>I'm afraid of her,</i>
<i>you see.</i>

131
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:50,108
<i>I've been wanting</i>
<i>to divorce her.</i>

132
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,734
<i>The first six</i>
<i>months of marriage,</i>
<i>I knew I made a mistake.</i>

133
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,487
<i>But no, I got</i>
<i>ahold of this first,</i>
<i>before she did.</i>

134
00:06:55,587 --> 00:06:57,489
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"Well, I'll answer it."</i>

135
00:06:57,589 --> 00:06:59,034
<i>But I wanted to</i>
<i>be honest about it,</i>

136
00:06:59,134 --> 00:07:00,452
<i>and I'm a man of conscience,</i>

137
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:01,783
<i>so I wanted to make sure,</i>

138
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:03,455
<i>if I put down I'm</i>
<i>the head of the family,</i>

139
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:04,748
<i>nobody would know</i>
<i>the difference, right?</i>

140
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:05,838
<i>No.</i>

141
00:07:05,938 --> 00:07:07,508
<i>I'll put it down...</i>

142
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,920
<i>I really like you.</i>
<i>Are you married?</i>

143
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,505
Hey!

144
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,924
<i>When you get married,</i>

145
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:17,257
<i>don't be like that whippo</i>
<i>that I married.</i>

146
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:18,466
<i>Would you?</i>

147
00:07:18,566 --> 00:07:21,139
<i>I'll try my best not to be.</i>

148
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:22,229
<i>All right.</i>

149
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:23,767
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
<i>It's nice talking to you.</i>

150
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:24,891
<i>You're welcome.</i>

151
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:26,193
<i>- Goodbye.</i>
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

152
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,779
<i>This is Mr. Whittington.</i>

153
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,238
<i>You were talking to a Mr...</i>

154
00:07:40,338 --> 00:07:43,869
<i>Oh, Valenti, the man</i>
<i>who blows bicycle pump</i>

155
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,952
<i>on the</i> Ted Mack
Original Amateur Hour<i>. Yes.</i>

156
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:50,915
<i>Yes, well, uh, I've</i>
<i>been trying to get in touch</i>
<i>with Mr. Mack myself.</i>

157
00:07:51,015 --> 00:07:54,380
<i>Because,</i>
<i>well, I've tried to...</i>

158
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:04,942
Huh.

159
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,977
<i>Well, I play music</i>
<i>on something unusual myself.</i>

160
00:08:09,077 --> 00:08:13,106
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>we're always looking</i>
<i>for original amateur talent.</i>

161
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:16,065
<i>Mr. Valenti is</i>
<i>unusual for the fact</i>

162
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:20,822
<i>that he not only</i>
<i>blows</i> Oh, Johnny
<i>on the bicycle pump,</i>

163
00:08:20,922 --> 00:08:24,451
<i>but also does nail file</i>
<i>on a high, flat table,</i>

164
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:28,079
<i>and also plays</i>
<i>the vacuum cleaner nozzle</i>

165
00:08:28,179 --> 00:08:29,415
It's a Great
Day for the Irish.

166
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,875
<i>You say you do</i>
<i>something unusual?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

167
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:35,003
<i>Well, what do you do,</i>
<i>may I ask?</i>

168
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,509
<i>I play meat.</i>

169
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,549
<i>- You what?</i>
<i>- I play meat.</i>

170
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,840
<i>You play meat?</i>

171
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,013
<i>Yes, meat.</i>

172
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:44,218
<i>You know, beef and pork.</i>

173
00:08:44,318 --> 00:08:45,346
That's sick, man.

174
00:08:45,446 --> 00:08:46,767
<i>M-E-A-T, meat?</i>

175
00:08:46,867 --> 00:08:47,941
<i>Yes.</i>

176
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,394
<i>It may sound a little strange.</i>

177
00:08:51,494 --> 00:08:54,397
<i>Yeah. I don't mean</i>
<i>to hurt your feelings,</i>

178
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:56,700
<i>but I've never</i>
<i>heard of anybody</i>
<i>who plays meat.</i>

179
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,526
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>think it's strange.</i>

180
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:02,323
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>I can understand that.</i>

181
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,579
<i>No offense.</i>
<i>Are you serious about this?</i>

182
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,823
<i>Yes. Yes.</i>

183
00:09:05,923 --> 00:09:08,747
<i>I've worked here as</i>
<i>an assistant butcher</i>

184
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:12,629
<i>and I've found in</i>
<i>a cold storage locker...</i>

185
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,083
Yes, sir.

186
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:57,417
Whatever you want,
I got it.

187
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:58,509
What do you want?

188
00:09:58,609 --> 00:09:59,754
Fill it with ethyl.

189
00:09:59,854 --> 00:10:02,216
If Ethel don't mind.

190
00:10:35,677 --> 00:10:37,540
Want me to check
under the hood
for you?

191
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,629
Uh, please. Yes.

192
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,233
Looks like you could use
a new radiator hose.

193
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,517
Where have I
heard that before?

194
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:58,230
I'll get one later,
thanks.

195
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,564
You're the boss.

196
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:02,151
Not in my house, I'm not.

197
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,957
Attendant?
Yes, sir?

198
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,289
You got change
for the telephone?

199
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:19,422
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,010
I'll get you
the rest later?

201
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,512
Be with you
in a minute.

202
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,569
<i>Operator.</i>

203
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,451
Operator, I'd like to
call 659-0716, collect.

204
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,575
Uh, Dave Mann.

205
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:54,833
The number here is 238-2098.

206
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,756
Thank you.

207
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,049
Excuse me.

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,716
Honey?

209
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,552
It's me.

210
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,928
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Did you have an accident?</i>

211
00:12:12,028 --> 00:12:14,349
No, it's nothing like that.

212
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:15,930
<i>Well, what happened?</i>

213
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,235
Well,
nothing happened.
I just, uh...

214
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,774
Well, I just wanted
to, uh, apologize.

215
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,147
You don't have
to apologize.

216
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:27,328
<i>I know I don't have to.</i>
<i>I wanted to.</i>

217
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,236
When I left
the house this morning,
you were asleep,

218
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,535
so I just wanted
to call you up and
tell you that, uh,

219
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:36,336
I, uh... I'm sorry
about last night.

220
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,839
Oh, I really don't
want to talk about it.

221
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,128
Well...

222
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,669
Don't you think
maybe we ought to?

223
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,422
No, because
if we talk about it,

224
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:47,590
we'll just get into a fight,

225
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,970
and you wouldn't
want that, would you?

226
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,185
<i>Of course not.</i>

227
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,645
What is that
supposed to mean?

228
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,268
Oh, never mind.

229
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,764
Uh, just a minute.

230
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:59,060
I know what it's
supposed to mean.

231
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,607
It means that you
think that I should go out
and call Steve Henderson up

232
00:13:03,707 --> 00:13:06,651
and challenge him
to a fistfight or something.

233
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,107
No, of course not.

234
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,111
But, honey, I think
you could have at least

235
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,694
said something to
the man last night.

236
00:13:11,794 --> 00:13:13,373
I mean, after all, he was

237
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,707
practically trying to rape me
in front of the whole party.

238
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,372
Oh, come on, honey.

239
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,382
Just forget it.
You gonna be home by 6:30?

240
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,088
If Forbes lets me go in time.

241
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,006
Is it that important
that you see him?

242
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,799
He's leaving for
Hawaii in the morning.

243
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:32,381
The way he's been
griping to the front office,
if I don't reach him today,

244
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:33,889
I could lose the account.

245
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,181
You said there
would be no problem
about getting home on time.

246
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,399
There probably won't be.

247
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,313
<i>It's your mother.</i>

248
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,396
<i>God knows she's</i>
<i>not coming to see me.</i>

249
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,404
Honey, I said there probably
won't be a problem.

250
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,452
Well, just be on time, okay?

251
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,570
All right.

252
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,906
Okay, I'll be there.

253
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,009
Here's your card, sir.

254
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,181
Be with you in a second.

255
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,600
You save
them stamps?

256
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,691
No, thanks.

257
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,397
Good enough.
Come back, now.

258
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,733
Will do.

259
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,861
I gave you the road.
Why don't you take it?

260
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,207
Why don't you go?

261
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,528
Oh, boy, you're beautiful.

262
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,174
I don't believe it.

263
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,803
I don't believe it.

264
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,350
I'm in no mood to play games.

265
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,608
Let's go.

266
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,811
Well, it's about time,
Charlie!

267
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,484
My God.

268
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,784
Jesus.

269
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,247
Come on,
you miserable fathead.

270
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:13,582
Get that fat-ass
truck out of my way.

271
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:26,098
Well, I'm never going to make
that appointment now.

272
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,541
You miserable...

273
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:06,133
Okay. Okay.

274
00:19:06,233 --> 00:19:07,469
You want to play games.

275
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,611
You all right, mister?

276
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,288
Yeah. Yeah, except...

277
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,199
Oh, my neck.

278
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:45,993
You got a whiplash,
probably.

279
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:47,952
Yeah. It's all right.

280
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:52,544
He's all right.

281
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,546
What happened?

282
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,175
That truck driver
tried to kill me.

283
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:03,844
Kill you? Go on.

284
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,301
He chased me down the mountain

285
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:08,931
at nearly 90 miles an hour.

286
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:10,933
I don't know what
else you'd call it.

287
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:12,860
Tried to kill you.

288
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,982
It sure looks like
you got whiplash.
Oh, it's...

289
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:18,357
You got the whiplash,
all right.

290
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:19,564
That's okay.

291
00:26:19,664 --> 00:26:21,650
Thank... It's okay.

292
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,742
Anything I can
do for you?

293
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:23,905
No, nothing. Thank you.

294
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:24,976
No. That's okay.

295
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,048
Okay.

296
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,750
Just a little whiplash is all.

297
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,302
What happened
out there, mister?

298
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:31,930
Can I use your
men's room, please?

299
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,002
Yeah.

300
00:27:33,102 --> 00:27:34,643
Through the door,
on the right,

301
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:38,480
down the hall,
turn left, second door.

302
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,415
<i>Well, you never know.</i>
<i>You just never know.</i>

303
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,299
<i>You just go along figuring</i>
<i>some things don't change,</i>
<i>ever, right?</i>

304
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,545
<i>Like being able to</i>
<i>drive on a public highway</i>

305
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:49,009
<i>without somebody</i>
<i>trying to murder you.</i>

306
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:52,019
<i>And then one</i>
<i>stupid thing happens.</i>

307
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,858
<i>Twenty, twenty-five minutes</i>
<i>out of your whole life,</i>

308
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,108
<i>and all the ropes that</i>
<i>kept you hanging in there</i>
<i>get cut loose.</i>

309
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,229
<i>And it's like,</i>
<i>there you are,</i>

310
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,238
<i>right back</i>
<i>in the jungle again.</i>

311
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,533
<i>All right, boy,</i>
<i>it was a nightmare,</i>
<i>but it's over now.</i>

312
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,126
<i>It's all over.</i>

313
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,000
Are you all right?

314
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,065
Yeah, I'm fine.

315
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,434
What happened
out there?

316
00:29:41,534 --> 00:29:43,817
Oh, just
a slight complication.

317
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,117
Oh?

318
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,613
Looked like a big
complication to me.

319
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,882
Well, ready to order now?

320
00:32:16,982 --> 00:32:18,513
Ahem. Yes.

321
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,061
Yes, thank you. Um...

322
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,856
Oh, I think I'll...

323
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,024
Just give me, um... Um...

324
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:36,445
Why don't you just give me
a cheese sandwich,

325
00:32:36,545 --> 00:32:37,863
Swiss cheese on rye?

326
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:39,444
R-Y-E.

327
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:41,029
Swiss cheese on rye.
All right.

328
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:43,493
And could I have another
glass of water, please?

329
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,454
Oh, sure.
Another glass of water.

330
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:46,583
Oh, uh, miss?
Yes?

331
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,456
Do you have an aspirin?

332
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:49,956
Aw, your head aches.

333
00:32:50,056 --> 00:32:51,792
Sure, I'll get you
some aspirin.

334
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,682
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>all I did was pass</i>

335
00:33:07,782 --> 00:33:09,434
<i>this stupid rig</i>
<i>a couple of times,</i>

336
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,566
<i>and he goes flying</i>
<i>off the deep end.</i>

337
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,607
<i>He has to be crazy.</i>

338
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,203
<i>Okay, so he's crazy.</i>
<i>What can I do about it?</i>

339
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,372
<i>Find him a psychiatrist?</i>

340
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,743
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

341
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,795
<i>Now wait a minute.</i>

342
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,256
<i>Now waitjust a minute.</i>

343
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,013
<i>All right, now, think.</i>

344
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,801
<i>Okay, he's in here.</i>

345
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:28,557
<i>Well, that doesn't mean</i>
<i>he intends to continue</i>
<i>his attack.</i>

346
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,562
<i>It is lunchtime,</i>

347
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,904
<i>and Chuck's Cafe</i>
<i>may be the only place</i>
<i>to eat for miles around.</i>

348
00:34:37,534 --> 00:34:40,567
<i>Yeah. He probably</i>
<i>eats here all the time.</i>

349
00:34:40,667 --> 00:34:43,238
<i>He was just</i>
<i>moving too fast before,</i>

350
00:34:43,338 --> 00:34:47,291
<i>and he had to slow down,</i>
<i>turn around, that's all.</i>

351
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,331
<i>That's all.</i>

352
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,673
<i>Why didn't I leave right away</i>
<i>when I saw his truck outside?</i>

353
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:04,304
<i>Then I'd know what</i>
<i>he intends to do.</i>

354
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,221
<i>What if he</i>
<i>followed me out, though,</i>

355
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:09,647
<i>started after me again?</i>

356
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,013
<i>I'd be right back</i>
<i>where I started.</i>

357
00:35:12,113 --> 00:35:14,937
<i>Even if I got a lead,</i>
<i>he'd overtake me soon enough.</i>

358
00:35:15,037 --> 00:35:18,269
<i>He's got some</i>
<i>souped-up diesel.</i>

359
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,191
<i>My car is just</i>
<i>not that powerful.</i>

360
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,869
<i>I just can't drive 80</i>
<i>and 90 miles an hour.</i>

361
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,112
<i>As soon as I</i>
<i>stop concentrating,</i>

362
00:35:26,212 --> 00:35:28,489
<i>I'd go back to 60 or 70</i>
<i>like I always do.</i>

363
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:30,410
<i>It's a habit.</i>
<i>I can't help it.</i>

364
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,870
<i>I... Take it easy.</i>

365
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,884
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

366
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:40,886
<i>Maybe I...</i>

367
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,057
<i>Maybe I should try</i>
<i>some kind of contact.</i>

368
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,552
<i>Well, I'd better do something.</i>

369
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,561
<i>Look, mister,</i>
<i>I'm sorry if I irritated you.</i>

370
00:35:55,661 --> 00:35:59,364
<i>Why don't I buy you a beer</i>
<i>and get this thing</i>
<i>straightened out, huh?</i>

371
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,652
<i>No.</i>

372
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,569
<i>Look, mister, I'm sorry</i>
<i>if I irritated you,</i>

373
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,407
<i>but let me, uh...</i>

374
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,044
There you are.
Anything else?

375
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:26,144
No, thank you.

376
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:27,935
Uh...

377
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,262
I'd like some ketchup.

378
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,620
<i>What if I called</i>
<i>the local police?</i>

379
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,329
<i>But then I'd</i>
<i>have to stay here,</i>
<i>lose more time.</i>

380
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:02,415
<i>What if he stayed, too?</i>
<i>Actually talked to</i>
<i>the police himself?</i>

381
00:37:02,515 --> 00:37:05,589
<i>Naturally,</i>
<i>he'd deny everything.</i>
<i>I've got no proof.</i>

382
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:08,089
<i>And I'm sure</i>
<i>none of these people</i>
<i>would back me up.</i>

383
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:09,189
<i>The cops will probably...</i>

384
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,805
<i>Okay, so now what?</i>

385
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:29,277
Look, uh...

386
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,405
I want you to cut it out.

387
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:38,505
What?

388
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,624
Just cut it out, okay?

389
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,123
Cut what out?

390
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,461
Now, come on. I mean...

391
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,047
Please, I...

392
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:54,302
Let's not play games.

393
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,382
What the hell are
you talking about?

394
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,560
I can call the police.

395
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,266
The police?
You think that I won't?

396
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,435
You're wrong, mister.

397
00:40:06,535 --> 00:40:09,356
If you think that you can take
that truck of yours

398
00:40:09,456 --> 00:40:10,899
and just use it
as a murder weapon,

399
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:12,855
just killing
people on the highway,

400
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,734
well, you're wrong.

401
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:16,195
You've got
another thing coming.

402
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,786
Man, you need help.

403
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,708
Don't you tell me I need help.

404
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,249
Hey! Hey, come on!

405
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,293
Who the hell do
you think you are,

406
00:40:30,393 --> 00:40:31,749
knocking my sandwich
out of my hand?

407
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,796
Come on, now.
You wanna fight,
get on outside.

408
00:40:33,896 --> 00:40:36,172
I don't wanna fight.
I wanna knock his head off.

409
00:40:36,272 --> 00:40:37,505
You already
hit him twice.

410
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:39,184
What more do you want, huh?

411
00:40:39,479 --> 00:40:41,092
Come on now. Look at him.

412
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,390
He's sick. Can't you see?
He ain't gonna fight no one.

413
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:44,595
That creep comes around,

414
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:45,930
knocks my sandwich
out of my hand.

415
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,859
All right, all right.
I'll buy you another sandwich.

416
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,225
I'll buy you
another sandwich.

417
00:40:49,325 --> 00:40:50,685
Come on, forget it.
No, forget it.

418
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:51,777
Forget it.

419
00:40:51,877 --> 00:40:53,604
I don't wanna stay
around here anyway.

420
00:40:53,704 --> 00:40:55,693
Let me buy you
a beer then, huh?

421
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,870
I'll buy you a beer.

422
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,411
Why don't you get
out of here, huh?

423
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,310
Yeah?

424
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:15,602
Mister, I'm sorry
to bother you,

425
00:44:15,702 --> 00:44:16,692
but I could use
a little help.

426
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:17,774
What kind of help?

427
00:44:17,874 --> 00:44:19,814
Well, I could use a push.

428
00:44:19,914 --> 00:44:21,270
Damn thing
overheated on me,

429
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,398
and I stopped
to let it cool off.

430
00:44:22,498 --> 00:44:23,731
Now I can't get
her started again.

431
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:25,816
Why didn't you
flag down that truck?

432
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:27,113
What truck?

433
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:29,320
The one that just went by here
a couple of minutes ago.

434
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,491
Guess I didn't notice.

435
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,702
I must have been inside
trying to get that piece
of junk shaking.

436
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,499
Would you
get off the car?
How about it?

437
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,416
I don't know.
Looks like I'd go
right underneath the bumper.

438
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:39,750
No.

439
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,713
Hey, get off the car.
You're gonna get hurt there.

440
00:44:43,813 --> 00:44:45,212
Nah, you're all right.

441
00:44:45,312 --> 00:44:46,508
Rodney,
get down from there.

442
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:47,801
That goes for
you too, Shawn.

443
00:44:47,901 --> 00:44:50,007
All right.
Come on, everybody!
Back on the bus!

444
00:44:50,107 --> 00:44:51,510
Wait a minute!

445
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:52,687
Wait, I...

446
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,521
Well, we'll see.

447
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,916
Come on. Come on.

448
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:44,906
Push! Push! Push!

449
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:49,369
Push! Push! Push! Push!

450
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:54,158
Push! Push! Push!

451
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,187
He can't do it!

452
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:30,195
You can't do it!
You can't do it!

453
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,531
Mr. Pfeiffer,
that guy's stuck, too.

454
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:38,789
Shit.

455
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,133
Sorry, mister.
I could have swore
we were okay.

456
00:46:54,233 --> 00:46:56,554
Yeah, well, I told you
we were gonna get hung up.

457
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:58,304
How about
I give you a hand?

458
00:46:58,404 --> 00:47:00,850
Don't sit on the hood.

459
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,232
That hood will dent.
I told the kids not
to get on the hood.

460
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:09,396
Just see if you can
bounce it loose,

461
00:47:09,496 --> 00:47:11,450
and I'll, uh, uh...

462
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,363
Just bounce it loose.

463
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,991
Hold it!

464
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,511
Something wrong?

465
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,020
That bastard turned
around and came back.

466
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,099
Is that the truck
you were asking about?

467
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,407
Uh...

468
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,524
Get those kids
out of the way.

469
00:48:32,624 --> 00:48:33,614
What for?

470
00:48:33,714 --> 00:48:35,609
Just get them off the road
and they'll be okay.

471
00:48:35,709 --> 00:48:37,235
They're all right.
They're not on the road.

472
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:41,240
Hey! Get back
in the bus. Please.

473
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,661
Please. Come on.
Come on. Back in the bus!

474
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:45,492
You're all right,
right where you are.

475
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:47,246
As long as you stay off
the road, you're okay.

476
00:48:47,346 --> 00:48:48,337
Come on!

477
00:48:48,437 --> 00:48:50,333
You're perfectly all right.
Just keep off the road.

478
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:52,416
Let's get back in the bus,
come on.

479
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:54,839
Get off of the highway.
There's a truck coming.

480
00:48:54,939 --> 00:48:57,715
You must be out
of your brains!

481
00:48:57,815 --> 00:48:59,142
Yeah! Yeah!

482
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,258
Come on! Please!

483
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:02,562
Take your hands off...

484
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,722
Come on.
Get back in the bus!
Get your hands off him!

485
00:49:04,822 --> 00:49:07,556
Now look, I know
how this must sound,

486
00:49:07,656 --> 00:49:08,853
but that man is crazy.

487
00:49:08,953 --> 00:49:10,771
He's been trying
to kill me. I mean it.

488
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:12,565
Well, I tell you,
if I had to vote on

489
00:49:12,665 --> 00:49:14,315
who's crazy around here,
it'd be you.

490
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:15,651
Uh, um...

491
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,034
When I bust them loose,
pull it back.

492
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,920
Now!

493
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,843
Hey! Hey!

494
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,197
Hey, stop!

495
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,699
Hey!

496
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,541
Hey!

497
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,101
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

498
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,271
Hi. Help you, mister?

499
00:56:09,371 --> 00:56:10,397
You got a telephone?

500
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:11,497
Out in the back.

501
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,944
This way?

502
00:56:14,044 --> 00:56:15,323
Something for your car?

503
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,360
Uh...

504
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:20,322
Well, you can put what ethyl
you can get in the tank.

505
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:21,830
All righty.

506
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,708
Would you mind checking
those radiator hoses?

507
00:56:29,808 --> 00:56:31,460
I'll do that.

508
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,842
Take a look at my snakes
if you have time.

509
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,983
Weird place for
a telephone booth.

510
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,485
<i>Operator.</i>

511
00:56:56,585 --> 00:56:57,905
I'd like to
report a truck driver

512
00:56:58,005 --> 00:56:59,736
that's been
endangering my life.

513
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:02,241
<i>In that case, I'll have to</i>
<i>give you the police, sir.</i>

514
00:57:02,341 --> 00:57:04,537
Right. Give me the police.

515
00:57:04,637 --> 00:57:06,912
<i>Sir, which department</i>
<i>do you want?</i>

516
00:57:07,012 --> 00:57:08,168
Whichever's closer.

517
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,664
<i>What number are</i>
<i>you calling from?</i>

518
00:57:10,764 --> 00:57:13,048
This number is 9821.

519
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,864
<i>What's your name, sir?</i>
David Mann.

520
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,235
<i>How do you</i>
<i>spell that, please?</i>

521
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:37,410
M-A-N-N.
That's two N's.

522
00:57:41,208 --> 00:57:43,033
I'd like to
report a truck driver

523
00:57:43,133 --> 00:57:45,038
that's been
endangering my life.

524
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,952
<i>What's your name again?</i>

525
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:48,288
David Mann.

526
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,173
Why'd he do that?

527
00:58:02,273 --> 00:58:04,808
Why'd he break my cages up?

528
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,835
Why'd he break
my cages up?

529
00:58:36,935 --> 00:58:38,668
Call the police!
With what?

530
00:58:38,768 --> 00:58:40,590
That's the only
phone I've got!

531
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:44,473
My snakes!
I've got to find my snakes!

532
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:56,360
Oh, my snakes.
My snakes.

533
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,230
<i>The highway's all yours, Jack.</i>

534
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,692
<i>I'm not budging</i>
<i>for at least an hour.</i>

535
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,942
<i>Maybe the police will</i>
<i>pull you in by then.</i>

536
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,368
<i>Maybe they won't,</i>
<i>but at least you'll</i>
<i>be far away from me.</i>

537
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:28,494
<i>"Well, dear,</i>
<i>did you have a nice trip?"</i>

538
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:35,205
<i>"Ah, no, no.</i>
<i>Just the same old thing."</i>

539
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,219
<i>Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.</i>

540
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:47,054
<i>Well, I won't be</i>
<i>seeing Forbes today,</i>
<i>that's for sure.</i>

541
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:46,215
What's the matter,
car trouble?

542
01:07:46,315 --> 01:07:47,288
Well, in a way, yes.

543
01:07:47,388 --> 01:07:48,636
I wonder if
you'd do me a favor.

544
01:07:48,736 --> 01:07:49,727
What's that?

545
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:51,429
Would you stop at
the nearest telephone
you come to

546
01:07:51,529 --> 01:07:53,014
and call the police?
Police?

547
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:54,517
Yeah, you see that truck?

548
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:55,937
Mister, we don't
want any trouble.

549
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:57,393
No, there won't
be any trouble.

550
01:07:57,493 --> 01:07:58,815
All I'm asking you to
do is call the police.

551
01:07:58,915 --> 01:07:59,982
Was there an accident?

552
01:08:00,082 --> 01:08:03,566
Ma'am, all I'm asking
you to do is just
make a phone call.

553
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:04,737
Jim, step on the pedal.

554
01:08:04,837 --> 01:08:05,923
My life's in danger!

555
01:08:06,023 --> 01:08:07,987
I'm sorry, mister...
Can't you make
a lousy phone call

556
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:09,409
to the lousy police for me?

557
01:08:09,509 --> 01:08:10,740
Stop it, mister.
You're scaring us.

558
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:14,001
Or just drop me off
at the nearest station.
I'll pay you for it.

559
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:16,082
Jim!

560
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,970
Okay, let's see you
catch me now.

561
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,676
Here we go.

562
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:56,238
Can't beat me on the grade.

563
01:10:56,338 --> 01:10:58,122
You can't beat me
on the grade!

564
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:53,885
Come on.

565
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:35,753
How can he go so fast?

566
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:49,783
Huh?

567
01:18:08,475 --> 01:18:10,307
<i>The radiator hose.</i>

568
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,940
<i>Oh, no, please! No!</i>

569
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:39,288
Oh, my God!

570
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:50,343
Come on, faster!

571
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,878
Oh, my God.

572
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:31,973
Come on!

573
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:34,221
Come on.

574
01:19:51,245 --> 01:19:52,452
Please.

575
01:19:56,375 --> 01:19:57,536
Come on.

576
01:19:59,712 --> 01:20:02,546
Come on, car.
Come on, let's go!

577
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,005
Come on!

578
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:14,219
<i>Where's the summit?</i>

579
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,472
Please. Please.

580
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,481
Come on!

581
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,562
Come on!

582
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,037
<i>There it is. There it is!</i>

583
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,398
Faster. Faster!
